       "['<p>“Yes, you heard right! This type of Dharmic Artifact is called Shut Up!” Wang Baole exclaimed in high spirits, his voice booming.</p> <p>After Wang Baole set off the second set of fireworks, everyone in the sky and on Upper Academy Island involuntarily fixed their gazes on Wang Baole once again.</p> <p>“What, is he determined to advertise his artifacts time and time again!”</p> <p>“What on earth is this, a Combat Pavilion Tournament or a new product release?”</p> <p>“Shut Up? What is he up to?”</p> <p>Everyone had different expressions. This particular Combat Pavilion Tournament was especially different from previous years.</p> <p>In the sky, those from the Military and Federation officials, as well as the senior management of Ethereal Dao College, also had unusual expressions. Looking at Wang Baole, they felt as though they were not watching a tournament but rather an unprofessional host putting up an amateurish live broadcast for the advertisement segment.</p> <p>But the most terrified of all were Lu Zihao’s competitors, the man and the woman. The moment Wang Baole opened his mouth to speak, they had been shocked. But now, after watching his actions and hearing his words, they were dumbfounded once again. Were it not for the layer of protection that he had, they would have instinctively stopped him. Wang Baole’s actions made them faintly uneasy.</p> <p>In a moment of panic, the burly fellow could not help but ask Lu Zihao, “What is he doing?”</p> <p>Lu Zihao was wallowing in misery. He felt like his spotlight was being stolen by Wang Baole yet again. He kept quiet. In a bad mood, he swung his fist.</p> <p>“That darn Fatty is playing tricks and creating trouble! He’s nothing to be afraid of! Big Black, Little Black, Little White, bite him!” exclaimed the female disciple from the Beast Taming Pavilion with a cold laugh, seeing that Lu Zihao kept quiet. Her eyes flashed, and with sharp movements, she manipulated her bloodthirsty wolves, making them run straight for Lu Zihao and bite him below his head.</p> <p>While their battle ensued, Wang Baole’s advertising continued.</p> <p>“Don’t belittle this object. This is a perfect second-grade Dharmic Artifact, its core being a Rainbow Spirit Stone. What more, this artifact is the sturdiest out there. I even carved over twenty thousand inscriptions on it! When you line this up with others, not only does it have an adjustable ability to lock onto target objects, it also produces fog…” As Wang Baole rattled on, his eyes grew ever brighter. With the wave of his right hand, three yellow masks instantly appeared!</p> <p>These three masks looked like ducks’ beaks, except their color was uneven. They looked ugly, but upon careful inspection, streams of light emanated from their interior, releasing a strong suppressive force.</p> <p>As Wang Baole spoke, he observed Lu Zihao retreating upon hearing the explosive roar of the three wolves. Worry instantly gripped him.</p> <p>“And now, let me demonstrate!” Wang Baole declared, violently flinging the three duck masks across the space.</p> <p>Having witnessed this, the female disciple sneered.</p> <p>“I hate fatties the most!” she exclaimed, feeling irritated by Wang Baole’s pretentious air. With a wave of her hand, the three wolves were sent darting for Wang Baole!</p> <p>But just as these three wolves were bounding for him, the three masks penetrated through the Golden Bell Shield, emanating a bright flash of light. In its resplendence, the masks released a suppressive force more shocking than previously. Furthermore, as they flew, the upper and lower lips of the mouths automatically came into contact, releasing weird, ear-piercing screams that instantly caught everyone’s attention.</p> <p>The three wolves also reeled in shock. As they stopped in their tracks momentarily, the three masks suddenly gained momentum. At a speed much higher than before, they locked onto the three ferocious wolves, flying straight for them. No matter how much the wolves struggled, attempted to hide, or even howled, it was of no use.</p> <p>Two of the masks had already covered two wolves’ mouths!</p> <p>However, the last mask seemed to malfunction under the sudden surge of speed. It failed to lock onto its target. It did not fly toward the third wolf, circling midair instead, as though it was ineffective.</p> <p>All this had happened too quickly. Before the female disciple could recover from her stupor, the two masks that had attached themselves onto the wolves’ mouths let out cracking sounds. In a flash, clamps formed on the masks, sealing the wolves’ mouths completely and permanently. The wolves were unable to completely open or close their mouths, and their howls stopped abruptly, as though they were strangled.</p> <p>The wolves collapsed under the impact. When they got to their feet, their whimpers were stuck in their throats. In a panic, they clawed at the masks, to the extent that even scratch marks formed, but they could not get rid of the masks within that short period of time. With a puff, fog billowed from within the two masks, filling the wolves’ mouths. However, the effect of the fog was unusual—those two wolves only swayed but were still conscious.</p> <p>The other wolf, although not affected by the mask, was evidently frightened. Fear flashed through its eyes, and it hurriedly retreated.</p> <p>“Little Black! Little White!” the female disciple exclaimed. Her expression instantly changed to one of worry, and she rushed forward to help them.</p> <p>At the same time, the observers on the sky viewing gallery were uninterested. These masks had their merit, but they were still considered to be ordinary, unlike the golden bead that Wang Baole had previously. Not to mention, one of the three masks had malfunctioned. This live demonstration was a failure in their eyes.</p> <p>However, on Upper Academy Island, there were many boos from those who had witnessed the scene that unfolded. There was a heated discussion about what had happened.</p> <p>“That was nothing. To think that one of them malfunctioned!”</p> <p>“Seems like this Wang Baole is running out of tricks. What a failure!”</p> <p>Wang Baole was also worried and started sweating. He knew that this must have been because he failed to consider many aspects when he manufactured the mask. Furthermore, he had some trouble with his inscriptions. In a panic, he hurriedly raised his right arm, and the mask that was circling the air returned to its master. He grabbed it.</p> <p>“Ahem, that was just a small mistake. This Dharmic Artifact, Shut Up, which I have made, is adjustable. I have recorded a list of seven to eight types of ferocious beasts in it, which you can add on to. Look, all I have to do is readjust this a little, then all is well!”</p> <p>Only, this time, when the mask flew off, it still did not lock onto the remaining wolf that was already stricken with fear. It flew into the sky. Wang Baole slapped his forehead and heaved a huge sigh. He knew that his advertisement had failed.</p> <p>Seeing his disappointment, the boos from Upper Academy Island became louder. When observers on the sky grandstand retracted their gaze, all of a sudden… that malfunctioning mask—after circling the air once—flew straight for the female disciple, as though it had a new target sighted!</p> <p>The uproar that followed was astonishing and ear-piercing. Immediately, those outside who had initially retracted their gazes looked over. One by one, they were greatly shocked.</p> <p>The female disciple was full of anger. She had been helping to remove the masks from her wolves, but upon witnessing the remaining mask coming for her, her eyes widened. Instantly, images of herself wearing the mask filled her mind. It was too frightening for her; she felt like her brain would explode. With a high-pitched scream, she hurriedly backed away.</p> <p>She was quick, but the duck mask was quicker. It whistled through the air and neared her in an instant. Just as it was about to cover the mouth of this petite, pretty girl, her face paled, and without thought, she took out many protective Dharmic Artifacts, blocking the mask immediately.</p> <p>Among the roar of commotion, this exceptional mask stopped in its tracks despite cracking after penetrating a few layers of the female disciple’s protective Dharmic Artifacts. Before she could heave a sigh of relief, it suddenly exploded. A thick cloud of fog was released in the blink of an eye, which floated straight toward the female disciple.</p> <p>Never mind the thick fog. To make matters worse, a thin rope, hidden in the fog, suddenly emerged from within the cracked mask. The female disciple’s expression changed once again. Although she could dispel the fog, she could not escape the rope. Soon, the rope had wrapped itself around her a few times, tying her hands behind her back.</p> <p>“Wang Baole!” she screeched. She had heard his self-introduction earlier on. She was enraged, but she could only stand there struggling.</p> <p>Wang Baole blinked, but he quickly came to his senses, immediately lifting his head toward the sky, coughing.</p> <p>“Actually, I wasn’t finished. This Dharma treasure is not only adaptable but is also amazingly effective on humans…” he said but was instantly interrupted by the huge commotion in the voice transmission ring!</p> <p>The number of voice transmissions skyrocketed, instantly hitting the roof.</p> <p>Concurrently, on Upper Academy Island in the outside world, tens of thousands of people paid close attention to this battle, of which many cried out in alarm, their eyes shimmering with excitement. Even disciples of the Dharmic Armament Pavilion took a liking to this product.</p> <p>Although there was an abundance of such adjustable Dharmic Artifacts in the Dharmic Armament Pavilion, the mask that Wang Baole had made—though not without flaws—evidently had unique characteristics. And sometimes, such characteristics could have unpredictable effects during actual combat.</p> <p>“It can do that too! Absolutely wicked! Too crafty! Wang Baole, I despise you! I want to get three!”</p> <p>“This Dharmic Artifact is amazing! To think it has three usages! First the face mask, followed by the fog, and lastly the rope! Simply impossible to guard against! It is worthy of being a formidable tool for bondage!”</p> <p>“All of you have a screw loose! So what if it can tie someone up? This artifact is prepared for our Alchemy Pavilion! Though that fog was rubbish, once we replace it, this baby will be awesome! Whoever smells it will faint!”</p> <p>“I want ten of them!”</p>',\n",
       " '<p>While the audience in the outside world was heatedly discussing about what had happened, Lu Zihao’s competitor—the Combat Pavilion disciple—also admitted defeat, depressed. There was no way that he could win. Fighting Lu Zihao was already a challenge. He was no match for him.</p> <p>Not to mention Wang Baole with his strange Dharmic Artifacts. It left his scalp tingling. That was especially so since his assistant was all tied up with her hands behind her back. Forcing a smile, this Combat Pavilion disciple could only admit defeat.</p> <p>At the same time, many of those in the sky platform had expressions of interest. Although they were learned with lots of experience, in their eyes, this subtle gimmick had its merits.</p> <p>However, the elder of the Combat Pavilion was in a fit of rage. A perfectly good Combat Pavilion Tournament was single-handedly being ruined by Wang Baole’s advertisements.</p> <p>If it were any other disciple, they would have long been afraid of the serious repercussions, but Wang Baole had the elders of the Dharmic Armament Pavilion putting in a good word for him. Furthermore, he had made great contributions to Ethereal Dao College. The former was a favor that he could not ignore, and the latter was the reason Wang Baole had special treatment in the first place.</p> <p>Quickly, after the elder of the Combat Pavilion expressed his displeasure, Wang Baole was given a lenient punishment. He was only given a warning, which came from the direction of Ethereal Dao College and could be heard from the sky platform.</p> <p>“Wang Baole, disciple of the Dharmic Armament faculty, focus on assisting! You must stop intentionally promoting your Dharmic Artifacts to the public!”</p> <p>This warning spread far and wide, throughout the entire combat area. Many disciples who were engaged in combat heard it and were surprised. Some of them had noticed the fireworks previously and deduced what had happened.</p> <p>The whole audience on Upper Academy Island heard it. Those who had considered following in Wang Baole’s footsteps immediately abandoned the idea.</p> <p>Wang Baole retracted his head. He had initially been full of excitement, but upon hearing the warning and knowing that he could not continue, he was depressed and wistful.</p> <p>“What a pity… I lost such a good advertising opportunity…” Wang Baole lamented, anger bubbling within him. He had neither cheated nor interfered with their combat. What right did they have to ban him from advertising his Dharmic Artifacts?</p> <p>Standing at the side, Lu Zihao became agitated. Truth be told, he had thought that this tournament would allow him to shine, but Wang Baole had stolen his limelight. Once was enough, but a second time? The thought made him uncomfortable.</p> <p>Seeing that the Dao College had banned Wang Baole from advertising, Lu Zihao felt that the Dao College had handled it brilliantly this time. Although anger festered within him, seeing the depressed look on Wang Baole’s face, he looked away with a snort.</p> <p>“This is unfair! Wang Baole, if I were you, I wouldn’t take this lying down! The Dao College is obviously targeting you. If you want my advice, you should fight it out with the Dao College. They won’t be able to do anything to you. After all, you weren’t wrong on this matter, and you’ve contributed so much to the Academy!” Lu Zihao whispered in Wang Baole’s ear, egging him on. He really did want to see Wang Baole fight it out with the Dao College.</p> <p>Only, Lu Zihao was too young and inexperienced at this. When Wang Baole heard this, he observed Lu Zihao through the corner of his eye.</p> <p>“You can’t take this lying down? Why don’t you do it then! Come, my son, come! Daddy will help you set off the fireworks while you fight it out with the College! As long as you can take down the elders, I don’t care if you call me Daddy or not!” Wang Baole exclaimed, lifting his hands and producing a small wooden bucket.</p> <p>“What a scaredy-cat, it’s so embarrassing to be seen with you!” Lu Zihao cried out angrily. He was shocked to see the small wooden bucket in Wang Baole’s hand. Snorting, he quickly backed away, making his way toward the third meeting point.</p> <p>“Look, if you’re so brave, why don’t you do it! Quit playing mind games with me!” Wang Baole retorted, rolling his eyes. Still depressed, he walked forward. When Lu Zihao heard this, he spun around in anger and glared at him.</p> <p>“Wang Baole, listen here. The first two times, I let you off, but if there’s a third time… if you dare steal my limelight again, I’ll fight it out with you! I’m not kidding!” Lu Zihao warned in a low growl, his eyes bloodshot.</p> <p>“This time, I don’t care what you give me! Don’t even try to bribe me. I, Lu Zihao, am a man of principle. This is my tournament!” Lu Zihao declared. He glared at Wang Baole, then turned around and sprinted toward the third meeting point.</p> <p>“What’s there to be worried about? The Dao College doesn’t let me advertise anymore. Don’t worry, I definitely won’t attack!” Wang Baole said, waving his hand. Deep in his heart, he was still regretful that he could not continue advertising and was too lazy to launch any attacks.</p> <p>By now, the two of them were not far from the meeting point. They could vaguely make out two figures standing at the end of the small road—the meeting point—waiting for them.</p> <p>One of them was short, and the other was tall. Both of them had calm expressions, but their eyes were full of vigor. As they stood there watching Wang Baole and Lu Zihao, their gaze seemed to harden. The duo did not attack, and they could not tell who the combat cultivator was or the background of his assistant.</p> <p>The moment he saw the duo, Lu Zihao’s eyes instantly brightened. Although Wang Baole had already promised that he would not attack, Lu Zihao was still worried that he would steal his show once again. Hence, he picked up his speed. Roaring, he went straight for the two figures.</p> <p>Seeing that Lu Zihao was so eager, Wang Baole simply stopped in his tracks, but in a flash, his expression changed. He observed that there was something amiss about the two figures standing at the meeting point.</p> <p>“Wait!”</p> <p>He should have kept quiet. The moment that word left his mouth, Lu Zihao increased his speed, as though someone had stepped on his tail. He went all out with a loud roar.</p> <p>But… he was sprinting too fast. At the same time Wang Baole let that word out, the short figure’s eyes flashed. At breakneck speed, he retrieved a compass and aimed it at the floor, pressing the button fiercely. Suddenly, a windstorm arose from all around, turning into a prison cage, exploding directly in front of Lu Zihao.</p> <p>“No!” Lu Zihao cried, his mind whizzing. His eyes were full of sorrow, and his roar reverberated across the area, but he simply could not hide from it. Instantly, he was captured within the windstorm. From afar, it seemed like he was trapped in a gigantic windstorm ball, effectively muting him and cutting him off. Even his growl had ceased.</p> <p>“An array cultivator?” Wang Baole questioned, showing a weird expression. Deep in his heart, he felt sympathy for Lu Zihao. He knew that he was just anxious to the point that he lost all sense of propriety, allowing him to fall for the array formation ambush.</p> <p>“This unlucky child, why were you so anxious? I already told you, I won’t attack. Look at what has happened…” Wang Baole sighed. He blinked and observed that the duo was coming for him with wry smiles. Evidently, their plan was to take the assistant down first before working together to defeat the competitor.</p> <p>Watching the duo come straight for him, Wang Baole’s eyes lit up. He pondered that this would be a good opportunity for him. Although he was banned from advertising, nobody said that he could not set off fireworks. In fact, that wooden bucket of fireworks was also a Dharmic Artifact in itself…</p> <p>While the duo was charging straight for him, Wang Baole lifted his right hand. Instantly, a wooden bucket appeared and flew skyward. It exploded with a loud boom, setting off resplendent lights that spread across the sky!</p> <p>Once the fireworks exploded, all in Upper Academy Island could not help but turn their heads toward the scene.</p> <p>The duo was shocked by the change in colors of the fireworks. At the same time—before the duo could reach him—Wang Baole’s eyes brightened. In his excitement, he waved his right hand. Immediately, three Flying Frost Swords flew out from his storage bracelet.</p> <p>“My two Daoists, listen up! That was just a shocking explosion of my first-grade Dharmic Artifact. What I now have is my perfect second-grade Dharmic Artifact! These swords are indestructible. To top it off, they have Rainbow Spirit Stones at their cores—equipped with formidable might!” Wang Baole roared. The moment those three swords appeared, the coldness spread, and they went straight for the duo.</p> <p>They were so quick that they seemed to have broken space. This changed the duo’s expressions. Immediately, they tried to block them, but just as this was happening, Wang Baole waved his hands and out came three big seals.</p> <p>“My two Fellow Daoists, listen up! This is my perfect second-grade Dharmic Artifact, the Mountain Seal. This seal welcomes the wind and has strength inscriptions inscribed internally. It’s akin to having a mountain crush the opponent!”</p> <p>“My two Fellow Daoists, look out for my Dharmic Artifact, the Deity Immobilization Rope! It can tighten or loosen, and it even has potent burning inscriptions!”</p> <p>“Both of you… this is the Baton of Abolition! Even rocks shatter in its presence. Never ever touch it, for it will explode!”</p> <p>“This is the Sky Destruction Whip! Once it explodes, blood will fill the skies!”</p> <p>“This is the Blinding Soul Mirror… You will lose your soul once you look at it!”</p> <p>As Wang Baole continued to speak, Dharmic Artifacts started popping out from his storage bracelet one by one until the entire area seemed to be covered. They whistled toward the duo like an overwhelming tidal wave.</p> <p>The place was so densely packed with colorful artifacts that the whole land seemed to be taken over by Dharmic Artifacts. All the artifacts within a glance were different, and to add to it, Wang Baole explained the how every Dharmic Artifact worked. The duo was struck dumb in amazement at its sheer absurdity.</p> <p>“What is he trying to do? What kind of habit is this, giving such detailed explanations!”</p> <p>“Damn it, why does he have so many Dharmic Artifacts!”</p> <p>The duo was angry and sorrowful. They wanted to retaliate, but they simply could not because Wang Baole had thrown out too many Dharmic Artifacts. Furthermore, his explanations added on to the stress that they felt. To top it off, the Dharmic Artifacts were extremely fast.</p> <p>Everyone in Upper Academy Island and the sky had weird expressions as they watched the two cultivators, instantly… drown in the sea of Dharmic Artifacts.</p>',\n",
       " '<p>The artifacts surrounded the duo without attacking. Although this was not as effective as an attack, simply being surrounded by dozens of different Dharmic Artifacts and watching them flash was enough to suggest their swift and forceful effects, as though a mere touch would trigger an explosion.</p> <p>This feeling was like having a knife suspending behind their neck, not knowing when it was going to chop their head off; the duo was about to go berserk. If they had not known the effects of the artifacts, they might have taken a gamble, but… Wang Baole had explained the effects of his artifacts to the finest detail. And watching the artifacts floating all around them, the images of their effects and the consequences of touching them surfaced in their minds.</p> <p>They could not help but panic. As their hearts pounded with fear, they were also sad and angry beyond belief. Deep down, they believed that they had been tricked and were full of regret—they should not have trapped Lu Zihao but his assistant from the Dharmic Armament Pavilion.</p> <p>“I know that Lu Zihao—he’s always playing mind games. When he came straight for us just now, roaring so loudly, it must have been on purpose! He was trying to divert our attention to make us trap him! We’ve fallen for their ruse!”</p> <p>The duo looked at each other, turning their heads to glare at Lu Zihao, who was still trapped inside the windstorm, fighting and kicking vigorously, totally unaware of the happenings in the outside world.</p> <p>“This asshole is too crafty! He’s still acting!” the duo commented, gritting their teeth as they had no choice but to admit defeat. Following this, the audience from Upper Academy Island was intrigued by the Dharma treasures that Wang Baole had used. Amid the many gasps, an uproar erupted.</p> <p>“He’s changed his methods! He’s using soft advertising this time!”</p> <p>“I’ve seen fighters shouting out their moves and the names of their Dharmic Artifacts, but I have never seen someone give such detailed descriptions…”</p> <p>The tens of thousands of people on Upper Academy Island had originally thought that Wang Baole would stop after receiving the warning. Never did they imagine that he would still continue advertising his artifacts… Although everyone could obviously tell that he was advertising, they could not say anything about it.</p> <p>He was not as deliberate about his advertisements as the previous times. He had only shouted out when he was attacking. His actions were ambiguous. He could say that this was a habit of his or claim that he was reminding his competitors of the effects before he attacked out of good will.</p> <p>Truth be told, he was not the only one to do such a thing. Others had done similarly, except none as obvious as Wang Baole, who even set off fireworks before the whole show…</p> <p>As for the audience on the sky platform, they did not know whether to laugh or cry at Wang Baole’s attempt to push the envelope. Watching Wang Baole with eyes of interest, General Zhou could not help but howl in laughter.</p> <p>Seeing that Wang Baole had succeeded in gaining the interest of General Zhou, Zhou Lu—who was standing at the side—smirked in excitement, thinking that her act of revenge was about to be complete.</p> <p>“Humph, Wang Baole, I, Zhou Lu, am not one to abuse public power to settle a personal dispute. Indeed, you are the most suitable candidate to carry out this mission!”</p> <p>The elders of Ethereal Dao College also pondered over what had happened. The middle-aged man in a red robe sighed, sneaking a glance at the Combat Pavilion Elder whose face was as black as coal. He coughed then sent his words reverberating for the first time.</p> <p>“Wang Baole, you’re not allowed to set off fireworks anymore!”</p> <p>This voice was filled with a suppressive force, immediately echoing around the combat area. Everyone in the Combat Pavilion Tournament was alarmed. Within this short amount of time, they had heard Wang Baole’s name twice.</p> <p>Wang Baole was satisfied. Even if he was singled out, he had no regrets. He had already introduced all the Dharmic Artifacts that he wanted to sell. He was in a flurry of happiness. Seeing the duo admit defeat, he lifted his right hand, and with a wave, all the Dharmic Artifacts instantly flew toward him.</p> <p>From afar, this scene was shocking. Under the lights emanating from the dozens of Dharma treasures that were surrounding Wang Baole, he seemed to glow. This scene was etched in the minds of the tens of thousands of people on Upper Academy Island.</p> <p>It was also at this moment that a loud sound ensued. Lu Zihao had finally escaped the windstorm. Roaring, he rushed out with great force.</p> <p>“Come, fight me!” he exclaimed with imposing might. The Flying Frost Swords around him lost their chilliness. After taking a few steps, he stopped in his tracks, staring dumbly at the duo who were now glaring at him. He observed the Dharmic Artifacts surrounding Wang Baole and came to a realization. His body started shaking, and his eyes became even more bloodshot.</p> <p>“Wang Baole! Didn’t you say that you wouldn’t attack? You stole my limelight again!” Lu Zihao roared, anger and sadness bubbling within him.</p> <p>Wang Baole glared at him. He was about to say something when the duo snorted coldly.</p> <p>“Lu Zihao, stop acting already. As if all this wasn’t an act!” the duo exclaimed, glaring at him. They turned to Wang Baole, cupping their fists to salute him.</p> <p>“Senior Wang Baole, we accept this defeat wholeheartedly!” the duo declared, having calmed down. They thought of the attacks that Wang Baole had executed earlier and were deeply moved that Wang Baole did not embarrass them. All of his Dharmic Artifacts were very amazing.</p> <p>After the salute, the disciple from the array formation pavilion could not help but ask, “Senior Baole, are you selling the Dharmic Artifacts that you used just now?”</p> <p>“Yes, I am!” Wang Baole replied, his eyes brightening. Hurriedly, he went forward to exchange voice transmission numbers with the duo, happily offering them discounts. In no time, the three of them hit it off. Wang Baole even walked a few steps with them as he sent them off, waving as he did.</p> <p>Lu Zihao was raging at the sight that unfolded before him. His brain was about to explode. Feeling very wronged, he let out another roar.</p> <p>“Wang Baole, you…”</p> <p>“I’ll give you two of the five Flying Frost Swords that are beside you!” Wang Baole interrupted, waving his hand with great generosity. He knew Lu Zihao’s character. He refused to lower himself to a child’s level. The matter could be solved with a few pieces of candy.</p> <p>“I… I, Lu Zihao, am a man of principle!” Lu Zihao exclaimed, his eyes widening. In an instant, his vigor dwindled uncontrollably, but he became angrier.</p> <p>“I’ll give them all to you!” Wang Baole offered, raising an eyebrow.</p> <p>Lu Zihao took a deep breath. Since it had already happened, whatever he said would be of no use. Besides, the assistant could only help out in four battles. As of now, there was only one battle left. Once it was over, it did not matter whether it was the final battle or the second stage of the competitions—he would not have to see Wang Baole again.</p> <p>Most importantly, when his principles were being tested, he did not fall for Wang Baole’s Trojan Horse. Once these thoughts flitted through his mind, Lu Zihao felt his anger dissipate. He wanted to snort, but recalling Wang Baole’s earlier reminder, he only snorted internally. With a gloomy expression, he whirled toward the fourth meeting point.</p> <p>This fourth meeting point was his assistant’s last battle!</p> <p>The tournament that took place there would determine the strongest competitor of each of the four sides of the mountain peak, and only those four competitors would be able to step onto the mountaintop for the battle of four. The last competitor standing on the mountain peak would then enter the second stage of the Combat Pavilion Tournament.</p> <p>Basically, those who could make it to the fourth meeting point were definitely not weak. Even as Lu Zihao approached, he tried to calm himself down, forcing himself to keep the utmost focus.</p> <p>From the perspective of the purpose of an assistant, in actual fact, Wang Baole had been very reliable, completing his tasks almost perfectly. Lu Zihao did not use many resources within the first three tournaments. In terms of energy and materials, Lu Zihao was at the peak.</p> <p>Lu Zihao was obviously not paying attention to Wang Baole. One after the other, they walked toward the fourth meeting point—the region near to the mountaintop. Following the merging of two roads, the end of the road was visible. There was a curtain of light, and beyond that was a road that led straight to the mountain peak.</p> <p>Wang Baole was in a good mood, so he did not pick a fight with Lu Zihao. He felt that he had accomplished his mission already and was very relaxed. His mind was filled with images of an abundance of filled order forms once he returned from his assisting role.</p> <p><em>I should be able to make a killing this time. It should be sufficient to sustain my research and cultivation,\\xa0</em>Wang Baole thought, filled with joy. He hummed a tune, strolling forward with his hands behind his back. As Lu Zihao got closer to the meeting point, he stopped dead in his tracks.</p> <p>It was as though every single hair on his body was standing on end. Sweating, Lu Zihao took a deep breath, making his heart pump faster. There was a serious, grave expression on his face as he saw the two figures at the fourth meeting point.</p> <p>“Wang Baole, you… you need to help me this time…” Lu Zihao took a deep breath and stammered in a low voice. When Wang Baole heard his words, he was surprised. As he got closer, he also saw the two figures.</p> <p>One of them was meditating while the other seemed to be a bodyguard standing beside him!</p> <p>The guard was strong-built, wore a purple armor, and had long hair that blew in the wind. He appeared like a small mountain standing there. The aura that he exuded was akin to the peak of True Breath, and it seemed like he could surpass this level any time.</p> <p>Looking at him was like looking at a terrifying beast. Extremely obvious was his fierce gaze, as though he was a volcano that was about to explode!</p> <p>Compared to him, the meditating youth had a different aura and gave off a different vibe. He exuded an aura of peace and indifference, as though few happenings in the world could gain his attention.</p> <p>Although he was bald, he was still handsome. He seemed gentle and frail-looking. His eyes were closed as if he was sensing something. Gentle winds circulated around him, as though they were attracted to him.</p> <p>This person was none other than the nameless Dao Enlightenment faculty disciple, the one who had made a drop of water appear in an empty cup—out of thin air—just by focusing on it, back then on the peak of the mountain in the Dao Enlightenment faculty!</p> <p>Also… he was the only personal disciple of the former Federation President, the present Grand Supreme Elder of Ethereal Dao College!</p> <p>Although Wang Baole did not know him, the moment that he saw the bald youth, his footsteps also slowly came to a halt. He realized why the proud Lu Zihao had asked for his help. In actual fact… the guard was nothing, but this meditating youth exuded an oppressive force that was like a sharp, invisible knife pointing between one’s eyebrows</p> <p>Wang Baole squinted and retracted his smile. He was no longer relaxed, and his eyes instantly glimmered a keenness.</p> <p>In that split second when Wang Baole looked at the bald youth, the latter… opened his eyes!</p>',\n",
       " '<p>As the bald youth’s eyes opened, they had an inexplicable attractiveness. His clear eyes, looking pure as water, seemed like they could suck one’s state of mind into them and cause one to be thrown into confusion.</p> <p>They might even have the illusion that their opponent’s body was exuding rays of light, as though he was a deity. The resulting feeling, wanting to worship the opponent, made Wang Baole shudder. His cultivation within his body started circulating immediately, and right at that moment, his devouring seed rotated slightly. As his cultivation circulated around his body, even Wang Baole himself did not notice that deep within his pupils, a purple glow flashed past!</p> <p>After Wang Baole absorbed the purple light in the Spirit Breath Village, it had integrated with his devouring seed. This formed a strange light—the purple glow that flashed in his pupils. The moment it appeared, the meditating bald youth suddenly let out a soft gasp. His original calm, elegant expression also changed at that moment. When he looked toward Wang Baole, his expression changed to one showing interest.</p> <p>As his expression changed, the previously formed suppressive force immediately destabilized and dissipated. This caused Lu Zihao, who was walking forward as though he could not control his footsteps and whose body was shivering, to shudder as though he had just awoken from a dream. His breathing hastened, and he had a stunned expression.</p> <p>“What kind of spell is this!” Lu Zihao exclaimed, caution and shock appearing in his eyes.</p> <p>Not caring about Lu Zihao’s reaction, the bald youth tilted his head slightly, with his posture showing a nobility seemingly deeply rooted within him. The guard beside him—the contestant from the Combat Pavilion—immediately bowed down to listen, nodding for a moment. After that, he got up and walked toward Lu Zihao until he reached the center of the meeting point. He raised his arm and beckoned Lu Zihao, as though challenging him to a duel!</p> <p>Lu Zihao’s expression changed, and he looked toward the bald youth with fear. Then he looked toward Wang Baole, his eyes pleading for help. It did not matter how proud he was—he put that all away at that moment. He knew that this battle would be extremely arduous because his opponent was too strong. But in his heart, Wang Baole was just as strong, so he instinctively looked toward him for help.</p> <p>“You even have a guard? Stop acting high and mighty!” Wang Baole furrowed his eyebrows and let out a cold snort. He could not get used to the bald youth’s posture just now, but at the same time, he also felt the suppressive force emanating from the bald youth’s body. Wang Baole felt that the bald youth was the strongest opponent that he had ever met in the same cultivation realm as him. Hence, he followed the bald youth and sat cross-legged, speaking calmly.</p> <p>“Zihao, there’s no harm in fighting. This is your big competition! If it’s one on one, it’s your issue whether you win or lose. But if it’s two on one, it depends on whether I, Wang Baole, agree!”</p> <p>Hearing Wang Baole’s words, Lu Zihao heaved a sigh of relief. Although he disliked Wang Baole and could not see eye to eye with him, Wang Baole’s words made him feel more comforted. At that moment, after he raised his head to look at the purple-armored cultivator beckoning him, fighting spirit exploded in Lu Zihao’s eyes. He let out a low growl and shot toward the purple-armored cultivator.</p> <p>With tremendous speed, he got close to the purple-armored cultivator instantly. With a few hand seals, he sent the five Flying Frost Swords surrounding him flying and threw out multiple amulets, transforming them into spells with a bang. Meanwhile, a cold smile appeared on the purple-armored cultivator’s face as he strode forward and stomped with his right foot. Immediately, Spirit Qi exploded from under his feet like a storm, and he burst toward Lu Zihao.</p> <p>Obviously, Lu Zihao had the upper hand in terms of agility and speed. At that moment, he dodged by phasing his figure away and attacked again.</p> <p>In a flash, the two of them clashed together in the middle of the meeting point.</p> <p>In this battle, even though Wang Baole did not set off fireworks, he still attracted the attention of the Federation officials, the Army, and Ethereal Dao College’s elders who were watching from the viewing platform in the sky.</p> <p>“Is he that person’s disciple?” On the Army’s viewing platform, General Zhou narrowed his eyes slightly, his gaze landing on the bald youth.</p> <p>“This person is named Li\\xa0Wuchen\\xa0<sup>1</sup>\\xa0. He’s the only personal disciple of Ethereal Dao College’s Grand Supreme Elder. With my authority, I can’t see his background and dossier,” Zhou Lu whispered at his side.</p> <p>“Of course you can’t see it… He should be twenty years old this year…” General Zhou’s eyes showed deep thought, and a cold glint gradually appearing in his pupils. However, he quickly suppressed it. He repeated the bald youth’s name in his heart a few times and remained silent.</p> <p>At the same time, the Federation officials all looked toward the bald youth. Obviously, they knew whom his master was, but they did not have as weird a reaction as General Zhou. At the very most, they only paid closer attention to him.</p> <p>But all the Elders of Ethereal Dao College had complicated expressions when they saw the bald youth. Even the middle-aged man in red robes had such an expression. Deep within his eyes, where others could not see, a cold glint flashed as well.</p> <p>As booms reverberated around the meeting point at that moment, Wang Baole and the bald youth were both meditating. They gazed at each other, as though they were facing off. After a while, Wang Baole felt a little bored and coughed.</p> <p>“Senior Brother, why do you keep looking at me?”</p> <p>“I’m looking at your past and present lives,” the bald youth replied calmly.</p> <p>After hearing that, Wang Baole had an odd expression on his face. He felt that this guy was crazy.</p> <p>At that moment, Lu Zihao’s duel with the purple-armored cultivator at the meeting point became increasingly intense, and it was obvious that Lu Zihao was at a disadvantage. After all, it was obvious that his cultivation level and battle experience could not compare to that of the purple-armored cultivator.</p> <p>Just as he was about to lose, the purple-armored cultivator suddenly retreated. In a flash, he returned to the bald youth’s side with a shake of his body and bowed toward Lu Zihao with cupped fists.</p> <p>“It’s a draw!”</p> <p>Lu Zihao was taken aback. As he was about to speak, a strange glow suddenly appeared in the bald youth’s eyes. He lifted his chin slightly and spoke softly while looking at Wang Baole.</p> <p>“Now, let’s duel!”</p> <p>Lu Zihao’s breathing hastened; he looked at the bald youth then looked toward Wang Baole. No matter how slow his reaction speed was, he understood that at this moment, his opponents’ target was not himself at all. It was Wang Baole!</p> <p>He even suspected that his opponents might have used an unknown method to him to find out that Wang Baole was assisting him, choosing to join the competition because of that. Without a doubt, their backgrounds were extraordinary; that was why they could meet Wang Baole and have this battle with him in the end!</p> <p>With those thoughts in mind, Lu Zihao had a conflicted look, but he did not say any more. Instead, he returned to Wang Baole’s side and remained silent.</p> <p>Wang Baole raised his head and gazed at the bald youth. Actually, from the moment he first looked at the bald youth, he already had the feeling that the bald youth was sitting there as though he was waiting for him.</p> <p>But that felt a bit ridiculous, so Wang Baole did not think much of it. However, seeing how obvious the bald youth’s actions and words were, he could not help but ask, “Do we know each other?”</p> <p>“Master said that a few people have tremendous potential and let me invite them to work together and support one another. You’re one of them, but I feel that you’re just ordinary. However, I thought about giving you a chance, so I looked for you to test you in a battle!” The bald youth raised his head and spoke calmly. As he spoke, it seemed like a certain aura was emanating from his body.</p> <p>“Can you speak normally? Can you stop posturing?” Wang Baole seemed speechless and raised his hand to smack his forehead. However, at the moment he raised his hand, he did not smack it against his forehead. Instead, he turned his palm over and slammed it toward the ground.</p> <p>With a boom, his body left the ground like a hare using the force from the slam. Like an arrow shot from a bow, he burst toward the bald youth instantly with his body almost pressed toward the ground.</p> <p>His actions were as smooth as flowing water, unexpected and cleanly executed. At that moment, Wang Baole’s speed was released without reservation, causing him to look like he was flying. His cultivation erupted completely, conjuring Spirit Qi storms around his body. From afar, he looked imposing. Getting close to the bald youth in the blink of an eye, he grabbed toward him.</p> <p>All this happened too fast, and the bald youth was stunned for a moment, obviously not given enough time to react. However, it was as though the sole purpose in life of the guard at his side—the purple-armored cultivator—was to protect Li Wuchen. Being well-versed in combat and constantly monitoring Wang Baole’s actions, he actually stepped out and blocked Wang Baole at that moment.</p> <p>A boom immediately sounded, and the purple-armored cultivator’s body shook violently. Shock appeared in his expression, and he retreated dejectedly while fresh blood leaked from the corner of his mouth. Nonetheless, his block had some effect, causing Wang Baole to slow down a bit.</p> <p>The bald youth’s breathing hastened, using this split second to retreat backward rapidly just as Wang Baole got close. He dodged Wang Baole’s grab, and it whizzed past his face. He raised his right hand, pressing toward Wang Baole through the air.</p> <p>Immediately, a huge boom sounded between the two of them, and a strong force exploded forth. It forced Wang Baole, raring to charge forward again, to take many steps backward, and regret appeared in his gaze.</p> <p>“Your reaction speed is pretty fast, but it’s a two on one, so you can’t be considered a true man.”</p> <p>“You’re shameless, you ambushed me!” the bald youth exclaimed angrily. He could not remain calm at that moment and retreated backward rapidly.</p> <p>“Finally, not posturing?” Wang Baole glared at him.</p> <p>Everyone who saw that scene on the sky platform had pleasant looks of surprise. That was especially so for General Zhou and the Red-robed Cultivator. The both of them had radiant glows in their eyes.</p> <p>“Nice!”</p> <p>However, Zhou Lu seemed very unhappy and muttered, “That’s a sneak attack. It can’t be considered as glorious!”</p> <p>“Did your brain get damaged from studying too much at White Deer Dao College? Pedantic!” General Zhou furrowed his eyebrows and, in a rare occurrence, berated Zhou Lu.</p>']"

      "{\"chapters\": {\"Chapter 150: It Also Works on Humans!\": \"<p>\\u201cYes, you heard right! This type of Dharmic Artifact is called Shut Up!\\u201d Wang Baole exclaimed in high spirits, his voice booming.</p> <p>After Wang Baole set off the second set of fireworks, everyone in the sky and on Upper Academy Island involuntarily fixed their gazes on Wang Baole once again.</p> <p>\\u201cWhat, is he determined to advertise his artifacts time and time again!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cWhat on earth is this, a Combat Pavilion Tournament or a new product release?\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cShut Up? What is he up to?\\u201d</p> <p>Everyone had different expressions. This particular Combat Pavilion Tournament was especially different from previous years.</p> <p>In the sky, those from the Military and Federation officials, as well as the senior management of Ethereal Dao College, also had unusual expressions. Looking at Wang Baole, they felt as though they were not watching a tournament but rather an unprofessional host putting up an amateurish live broadcast for the advertisement segment.</p> <p>But the most terrified of all were Lu Zihao\\u2019s competitors, the man and the woman. The moment Wang Baole opened his mouth to speak, they had been shocked. But now, after watching his actions and hearing his words, they were dumbfounded once again. Were it not for the layer of protection that he had, they would have instinctively stopped him. Wang Baole\\u2019s actions made them faintly uneasy.</p> <p>In a moment of panic, the burly fellow could not help but ask Lu Zihao, \\u201cWhat is he doing?\\u201d</p> <p>Lu Zihao was wallowing in misery. He felt like his spotlight was being stolen by Wang Baole yet again. He kept quiet. In a bad mood, he swung his fist.</p> <p>\\u201cThat darn Fatty is playing tricks and creating trouble! He\\u2019s nothing to be afraid of! Big Black, Little Black, Little White, bite him!\\u201d exclaimed the female disciple from the Beast Taming Pavilion with a cold laugh, seeing that Lu Zihao kept quiet. Her eyes flashed, and with sharp movements, she manipulated her bloodthirsty wolves, making them run straight for Lu Zihao and bite him below his head.</p> <p>While their battle ensued, Wang Baole\\u2019s advertising continued.</p> <p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t belittle this object. This is a perfect second-grade Dharmic Artifact, its core being a Rainbow Spirit Stone. What more, this artifact is the sturdiest out there. I even carved over twenty thousand inscriptions on it! When you line this up with others, not only does it have an adjustable ability to lock onto target objects, it also produces fog\\u2026\\u201d As Wang Baole rattled on, his eyes grew ever brighter. With the wave of his right hand, three yellow masks instantly appeared!</p> <p>These three masks looked like ducks\\u2019 beaks, except their color was uneven. They looked ugly, but upon careful inspection, streams of light emanated from their interior, releasing a strong suppressive force.</p> <p>As Wang Baole spoke, he observed Lu Zihao retreating upon hearing the explosive roar of the three wolves. Worry instantly gripped him.</p> <p>\\u201cAnd now, let me demonstrate!\\u201d Wang Baole declared, violently flinging the three duck masks across the space.</p> <p>Having witnessed this, the female disciple sneered.</p> <p>\\u201cI hate fatties the most!\\u201d she exclaimed, feeling irritated by Wang Baole\\u2019s pretentious air. With a wave of her hand, the three wolves were sent darting for Wang Baole!</p> <p>But just as these three wolves were bounding for him, the three masks penetrated through the Golden Bell Shield, emanating a bright flash of light. In its resplendence, the masks released a suppressive force more shocking than previously. Furthermore, as they flew, the upper and lower lips of the mouths automatically came into contact, releasing weird, ear-piercing screams that instantly caught everyone\\u2019s attention.</p> <p>The three wolves also reeled in shock. As they stopped in their tracks momentarily, the three masks suddenly gained momentum. At a speed much higher than before, they locked onto the three ferocious wolves, flying straight for them. No matter how much the wolves struggled, attempted to hide, or even howled, it was of no use.</p> <p>Two of the masks had already covered two wolves\\u2019 mouths!</p> <p>However, the last mask seemed to malfunction under the sudden surge of speed. It failed to lock onto its target. It did not fly toward the third wolf, circling midair instead, as though it was ineffective.</p> <p>All this had happened too quickly. Before the female disciple could recover from her stupor, the two masks that had attached themselves onto the wolves\\u2019 mouths let out cracking sounds. In a flash, clamps formed on the masks, sealing the wolves\\u2019 mouths completely and permanently. The wolves were unable to completely open or close their mouths, and their howls stopped abruptly, as though they were strangled.</p> <p>The wolves collapsed under the impact. When they got to their feet, their whimpers were stuck in their throats. In a panic, they clawed at the masks, to the extent that even scratch marks formed, but they could not get rid of the masks within that short period of time. With a puff, fog billowed from within the two masks, filling the wolves\\u2019 mouths. However, the effect of the fog was unusual\\u2014those two wolves only swayed but were still conscious.</p> <p>The other wolf, although not affected by the mask, was evidently frightened. Fear flashed through its eyes, and it hurriedly retreated.</p> <p>\\u201cLittle Black! Little White!\\u201d the female disciple exclaimed. Her expression instantly changed to one of worry, and she rushed forward to help them.</p> <p>At the same time, the observers on the sky viewing gallery were uninterested. These masks had their merit, but they were still considered to be ordinary, unlike the golden bead that Wang Baole had previously. Not to mention, one of the three masks had malfunctioned. This live demonstration was a failure in their eyes.</p> <p>However, on Upper Academy Island, there were many boos from those who had witnessed the scene that unfolded. There was a heated discussion about what had happened.</p> <p>\\u201cThat was nothing. To think that one of them malfunctioned!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cSeems like this Wang Baole is running out of tricks. What a failure!\\u201d</p> <p>Wang Baole was also worried and started sweating. He knew that this must have been because he failed to consider many aspects when he manufactured the mask. Furthermore, he had some trouble with his inscriptions. In a panic, he hurriedly raised his right arm, and the mask that was circling the air returned to its master. He grabbed it.</p> <p>\\u201cAhem, that was just a small mistake. This Dharmic Artifact, Shut Up, which I have made, is adjustable. I have recorded a list of seven to eight types of ferocious beasts in it, which you can add on to. Look, all I have to do is readjust this a little, then all is well!\\u201d</p> <p>Only, this time, when the mask flew off, it still did not lock onto the remaining wolf that was already stricken with fear. It flew into the sky. Wang Baole slapped his forehead and heaved a huge sigh. He knew that his advertisement had failed.</p> <p>Seeing his disappointment, the boos from Upper Academy Island became louder. When observers on the sky grandstand retracted their gaze, all of a sudden\\u2026 that malfunctioning mask\\u2014after circling the air once\\u2014flew straight for the female disciple, as though it had a new target sighted!</p> <p>The uproar that followed was astonishing and ear-piercing. Immediately, those outside who had initially retracted their gazes looked over. One by one, they were greatly shocked.</p> <p>The female disciple was full of anger. She had been helping to remove the masks from her wolves, but upon witnessing the remaining mask coming for her, her eyes widened. Instantly, images of herself wearing the mask filled her mind. It was too frightening for her; she felt like her brain would explode. With a high-pitched scream, she hurriedly backed away.</p> <p>She was quick, but the duck mask was quicker. It whistled through the air and neared her in an instant. Just as it was about to cover the mouth of this petite, pretty girl, her face paled, and without thought, she took out many protective Dharmic Artifacts, blocking the mask immediately.</p> <p>Among the roar of commotion, this exceptional mask stopped in its tracks despite cracking after penetrating a few layers of the female disciple\\u2019s protective Dharmic Artifacts. Before she could heave a sigh of relief, it suddenly exploded. A thick cloud of fog was released in the blink of an eye, which floated straight toward the female disciple.</p> <p>Never mind the thick fog. To make matters worse, a thin rope, hidden in the fog, suddenly emerged from within the cracked mask. The female disciple\\u2019s expression changed once again. Although she could dispel the fog, she could not escape the rope. Soon, the rope had wrapped itself around her a few times, tying her hands behind her back.</p> <p>\\u201cWang Baole!\\u201d she screeched. She had heard his self-introduction earlier on. She was enraged, but she could only stand there struggling.</p> <p>Wang Baole blinked, but he quickly came to his senses, immediately lifting his head toward the sky, coughing.</p> <p>\\u201cActually, I wasn\\u2019t finished. This Dharma treasure is not only adaptable but is also amazingly effective on humans\\u2026\\u201d he said but was instantly interrupted by the huge commotion in the voice transmission ring!</p> <p>The number of voice transmissions skyrocketed, instantly hitting the roof.</p> <p>Concurrently, on Upper Academy Island in the outside world, tens of thousands of people paid close attention to this battle, of which many cried out in alarm, their eyes shimmering with excitement. Even disciples of the Dharmic Armament Pavilion took a liking to this product.</p> <p>Although there was an abundance of such adjustable Dharmic Artifacts in the Dharmic Armament Pavilion, the mask that Wang Baole had made\\u2014though not without flaws\\u2014evidently had unique characteristics. And sometimes, such characteristics could have unpredictable effects during actual combat.</p> <p>\\u201cIt can do that too! Absolutely wicked! Too crafty! Wang Baole, I despise you! I want to get three!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cThis Dharmic Artifact is amazing! To think it has three usages! First the face mask, followed by the fog, and lastly the rope! Simply impossible to guard against! It is worthy of being a formidable tool for bondage!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cAll of you have a screw loose! So what if it can tie someone up? This artifact is prepared for our Alchemy Pavilion! Though that fog was rubbish, once we replace it, this baby will be awesome! Whoever smells it will faint!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cI want ten of them!\\u201d</p>\", \"Chapter 151: Daoists, Listen Up!\": \"<p>While the audience in the outside world was heatedly discussing about what had happened, Lu Zihao\\u2019s competitor\\u2014the Combat Pavilion disciple\\u2014also admitted defeat, depressed. There was no way that he could win. Fighting Lu Zihao was already a challenge. He was no match for him.</p> <p>Not to mention Wang Baole with his strange Dharmic Artifacts. It left his scalp tingling. That was especially so since his assistant was all tied up with her hands behind her back. Forcing a smile, this Combat Pavilion disciple could only admit defeat.</p> <p>At the same time, many of those in the sky platform had expressions of interest. Although they were learned with lots of experience, in their eyes, this subtle gimmick had its merits.</p> <p>However, the elder of the Combat Pavilion was in a fit of rage. A perfectly good Combat Pavilion Tournament was single-handedly being ruined by Wang Baole\\u2019s advertisements.</p> <p>If it were any other disciple, they would have long been afraid of the serious repercussions, but Wang Baole had the elders of the Dharmic Armament Pavilion putting in a good word for him. Furthermore, he had made great contributions to Ethereal Dao College. The former was a favor that he could not ignore, and the latter was the reason Wang Baole had special treatment in the first place.</p> <p>Quickly, after the elder of the Combat Pavilion expressed his displeasure, Wang Baole was given a lenient punishment. He was only given a warning, which came from the direction of Ethereal Dao College and could be heard from the sky platform.</p> <p>\\u201cWang Baole, disciple of the Dharmic Armament faculty, focus on assisting! You must stop intentionally promoting your Dharmic Artifacts to the public!\\u201d</p> <p>This warning spread far and wide, throughout the entire combat area. Many disciples who were engaged in combat heard it and were surprised. Some of them had noticed the fireworks previously and deduced what had happened.</p> <p>The whole audience on Upper Academy Island heard it. Those who had considered following in Wang Baole\\u2019s footsteps immediately abandoned the idea.</p> <p>Wang Baole retracted his head. He had initially been full of excitement, but upon hearing the warning and knowing that he could not continue, he was depressed and wistful.</p> <p>\\u201cWhat a pity\\u2026 I lost such a good advertising opportunity\\u2026\\u201d Wang Baole lamented, anger bubbling within him. He had neither cheated nor interfered with their combat. What right did they have to ban him from advertising his Dharmic Artifacts?</p> <p>Standing at the side, Lu Zihao became agitated. Truth be told, he had thought that this tournament would allow him to shine, but Wang Baole had stolen his limelight. Once was enough, but a second time? The thought made him uncomfortable.</p> <p>Seeing that the Dao College had banned Wang Baole from advertising, Lu Zihao felt that the Dao College had handled it brilliantly this time. Although anger festered within him, seeing the depressed look on Wang Baole\\u2019s face, he looked away with a snort.</p> <p>\\u201cThis is unfair! Wang Baole, if I were you, I wouldn\\u2019t take this lying down! The Dao College is obviously targeting you. If you want my advice, you should fight it out with the Dao College. They won\\u2019t be able to do anything to you. After all, you weren\\u2019t wrong on this matter, and you\\u2019ve contributed so much to the Academy!\\u201d Lu Zihao whispered in Wang Baole\\u2019s ear, egging him on. He really did want to see Wang Baole fight it out with the Dao College.</p> <p>Only, Lu Zihao was too young and inexperienced at this. When Wang Baole heard this, he observed Lu Zihao through the corner of his eye.</p> <p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t take this lying down? Why don\\u2019t you do it then! Come, my son, come! Daddy will help you set off the fireworks while you fight it out with the College! As long as you can take down the elders, I don\\u2019t care if you call me Daddy or not!\\u201d Wang Baole exclaimed, lifting his hands and producing a small wooden bucket.</p> <p>\\u201cWhat a scaredy-cat, it\\u2019s so embarrassing to be seen with you!\\u201d Lu Zihao cried out angrily. He was shocked to see the small wooden bucket in Wang Baole\\u2019s hand. Snorting, he quickly backed away, making his way toward the third meeting point.</p> <p>\\u201cLook, if you\\u2019re so brave, why don\\u2019t you do it! Quit playing mind games with me!\\u201d Wang Baole retorted, rolling his eyes. Still depressed, he walked forward. When Lu Zihao heard this, he spun around in anger and glared at him.</p> <p>\\u201cWang Baole, listen here. The first two times, I let you off, but if there\\u2019s a third time\\u2026 if you dare steal my limelight again, I\\u2019ll fight it out with you! I\\u2019m not kidding!\\u201d Lu Zihao warned in a low growl, his eyes bloodshot.</p> <p>\\u201cThis time, I don\\u2019t care what you give me! Don\\u2019t even try to bribe me. I, Lu Zihao, am a man of principle. This is my tournament!\\u201d Lu Zihao declared. He glared at Wang Baole, then turned around and sprinted toward the third meeting point.</p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s there to be worried about? The Dao College doesn\\u2019t let me advertise anymore. Don\\u2019t worry, I definitely won\\u2019t attack!\\u201d Wang Baole said, waving his hand. Deep in his heart, he was still regretful that he could not continue advertising and was too lazy to launch any attacks.</p> <p>By now, the two of them were not far from the meeting point. They could vaguely make out two figures standing at the end of the small road\\u2014the meeting point\\u2014waiting for them.</p> <p>One of them was short, and the other was tall. Both of them had calm expressions, but their eyes were full of vigor. As they stood there watching Wang Baole and Lu Zihao, their gaze seemed to harden. The duo did not attack, and they could not tell who the combat cultivator was or the background of his assistant.</p> <p>The moment he saw the duo, Lu Zihao\\u2019s eyes instantly brightened. Although Wang Baole had already promised that he would not attack, Lu Zihao was still worried that he would steal his show once again. Hence, he picked up his speed. Roaring, he went straight for the two figures.</p> <p>Seeing that Lu Zihao was so eager, Wang Baole simply stopped in his tracks, but in a flash, his expression changed. He observed that there was something amiss about the two figures standing at the meeting point.</p> <p>\\u201cWait!\\u201d</p> <p>He should have kept quiet. The moment that word left his mouth, Lu Zihao increased his speed, as though someone had stepped on his tail. He went all out with a loud roar.</p> <p>But\\u2026 he was sprinting too fast. At the same time Wang Baole let that word out, the short figure\\u2019s eyes flashed. At breakneck speed, he retrieved a compass and aimed it at the floor, pressing the button fiercely. Suddenly, a windstorm arose from all around, turning into a prison cage, exploding directly in front of Lu Zihao.</p> <p>\\u201cNo!\\u201d Lu Zihao cried, his mind whizzing. His eyes were full of sorrow, and his roar reverberated across the area, but he simply could not hide from it. Instantly, he was captured within the windstorm. From afar, it seemed like he was trapped in a gigantic windstorm ball, effectively muting him and cutting him off. Even his growl had ceased.</p> <p>\\u201cAn array cultivator?\\u201d Wang Baole questioned, showing a weird expression. Deep in his heart, he felt sympathy for Lu Zihao. He knew that he was just anxious to the point that he lost all sense of propriety, allowing him to fall for the array formation ambush.</p> <p>\\u201cThis unlucky child, why were you so anxious? I already told you, I won\\u2019t attack. Look at what has happened\\u2026\\u201d Wang Baole sighed. He blinked and observed that the duo was coming for him with wry smiles. Evidently, their plan was to take the assistant down first before working together to defeat the competitor.</p> <p>Watching the duo come straight for him, Wang Baole\\u2019s eyes lit up. He pondered that this would be a good opportunity for him. Although he was banned from advertising, nobody said that he could not set off fireworks. In fact, that wooden bucket of fireworks was also a Dharmic Artifact in itself\\u2026</p> <p>While the duo was charging straight for him, Wang Baole lifted his right hand. Instantly, a wooden bucket appeared and flew skyward. It exploded with a loud boom, setting off resplendent lights that spread across the sky!</p> <p>Once the fireworks exploded, all in Upper Academy Island could not help but turn their heads toward the scene.</p> <p>The duo was shocked by the change in colors of the fireworks. At the same time\\u2014before the duo could reach him\\u2014Wang Baole\\u2019s eyes brightened. In his excitement, he waved his right hand. Immediately, three Flying Frost Swords flew out from his storage bracelet.</p> <p>\\u201cMy two Daoists, listen up! That was just a shocking explosion of my first-grade Dharmic Artifact. What I now have is my perfect second-grade Dharmic Artifact! These swords are indestructible. To top it off, they have Rainbow Spirit Stones at their cores\\u2014equipped with formidable might!\\u201d Wang Baole roared. The moment those three swords appeared, the coldness spread, and they went straight for the duo.</p> <p>They were so quick that they seemed to have broken space. This changed the duo\\u2019s expressions. Immediately, they tried to block them, but just as this was happening, Wang Baole waved his hands and out came three big seals.</p> <p>\\u201cMy two Fellow Daoists, listen up! This is my perfect second-grade Dharmic Artifact, the Mountain Seal. This seal welcomes the wind and has strength inscriptions inscribed internally. It\\u2019s akin to having a mountain crush the opponent!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cMy two Fellow Daoists, look out for my Dharmic Artifact, the Deity Immobilization Rope! It can tighten or loosen, and it even has potent burning inscriptions!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cBoth of you\\u2026 this is the Baton of Abolition! Even rocks shatter in its presence. Never ever touch it, for it will explode!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cThis is the Sky Destruction Whip! Once it explodes, blood will fill the skies!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cThis is the Blinding Soul Mirror\\u2026 You will lose your soul once you look at it!\\u201d</p> <p>As Wang Baole continued to speak, Dharmic Artifacts started popping out from his storage bracelet one by one until the entire area seemed to be covered. They whistled toward the duo like an overwhelming tidal wave.</p> <p>The place was so densely packed with colorful artifacts that the whole land seemed to be taken over by Dharmic Artifacts. All the artifacts within a glance were different, and to add to it, Wang Baole explained the how every Dharmic Artifact worked. The duo was struck dumb in amazement at its sheer absurdity.</p> <p>\\u201cWhat is he trying to do? What kind of habit is this, giving such detailed explanations!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cDamn it, why does he have so many Dharmic Artifacts!\\u201d</p> <p>The duo was angry and sorrowful. They wanted to retaliate, but they simply could not because Wang Baole had thrown out too many Dharmic Artifacts. Furthermore, his explanations added on to the stress that they felt. To top it off, the Dharmic Artifacts were extremely fast.</p> <p>Everyone in Upper Academy Island and the sky had weird expressions as they watched the two cultivators, instantly\\u2026 drown in the sea of Dharmic Artifacts.</p>\", \"Chapter 152: The Grand Supreme Elder\\u2019s Personal Disciple!\": \"<p>The artifacts surrounded the duo without attacking. Although this was not as effective as an attack, simply being surrounded by dozens of different Dharmic Artifacts and watching them flash was enough to suggest their swift and forceful effects, as though a mere touch would trigger an explosion.</p> <p>This feeling was like having a knife suspending behind their neck, not knowing when it was going to chop their head off; the duo was about to go berserk. If they had not known the effects of the artifacts, they might have taken a gamble, but\\u2026 Wang Baole had explained the effects of his artifacts to the finest detail. And watching the artifacts floating all around them, the images of their effects and the consequences of touching them surfaced in their minds.</p> <p>They could not help but panic. As their hearts pounded with fear, they were also sad and angry beyond belief. Deep down, they believed that they had been tricked and were full of regret\\u2014they should not have trapped Lu Zihao but his assistant from the Dharmic Armament Pavilion.</p> <p>\\u201cI know that Lu Zihao\\u2014he\\u2019s always playing mind games. When he came straight for us just now, roaring so loudly, it must have been on purpose! He was trying to divert our attention to make us trap him! We\\u2019ve fallen for their ruse!\\u201d</p> <p>The duo looked at each other, turning their heads to glare at Lu Zihao, who was still trapped inside the windstorm, fighting and kicking vigorously, totally unaware of the happenings in the outside world.</p> <p>\\u201cThis asshole is too crafty! He\\u2019s still acting!\\u201d the duo commented, gritting their teeth as they had no choice but to admit defeat. Following this, the audience from Upper Academy Island was intrigued by the Dharma treasures that Wang Baole had used. Amid the many gasps, an uproar erupted.</p> <p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s changed his methods! He\\u2019s using soft advertising this time!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen fighters shouting out their moves and the names of their Dharmic Artifacts, but I have never seen someone give such detailed descriptions\\u2026\\u201d</p> <p>The tens of thousands of people on Upper Academy Island had originally thought that Wang Baole would stop after receiving the warning. Never did they imagine that he would still continue advertising his artifacts\\u2026 Although everyone could obviously tell that he was advertising, they could not say anything about it.</p> <p>He was not as deliberate about his advertisements as the previous times. He had only shouted out when he was attacking. His actions were ambiguous. He could say that this was a habit of his or claim that he was reminding his competitors of the effects before he attacked out of good will.</p> <p>Truth be told, he was not the only one to do such a thing. Others had done similarly, except none as obvious as Wang Baole, who even set off fireworks before the whole show\\u2026</p> <p>As for the audience on the sky platform, they did not know whether to laugh or cry at Wang Baole\\u2019s attempt to push the envelope. Watching Wang Baole with eyes of interest, General Zhou could not help but howl in laughter.</p> <p>Seeing that Wang Baole had succeeded in gaining the interest of General Zhou, Zhou Lu\\u2014who was standing at the side\\u2014smirked in excitement, thinking that her act of revenge was about to be complete.</p> <p>\\u201cHumph, Wang Baole, I, Zhou Lu, am not one to abuse public power to settle a personal dispute. Indeed, you are the most suitable candidate to carry out this mission!\\u201d</p> <p>The elders of Ethereal Dao College also pondered over what had happened. The middle-aged man in a red robe sighed, sneaking a glance at the Combat Pavilion Elder whose face was as black as coal. He coughed then sent his words reverberating for the first time.</p> <p>\\u201cWang Baole, you\\u2019re not allowed to set off fireworks anymore!\\u201d</p> <p>This voice was filled with a suppressive force, immediately echoing around the combat area. Everyone in the Combat Pavilion Tournament was alarmed. Within this short amount of time, they had heard Wang Baole\\u2019s name twice.</p> <p>Wang Baole was satisfied. Even if he was singled out, he had no regrets. He had already introduced all the Dharmic Artifacts that he wanted to sell. He was in a flurry of happiness. Seeing the duo admit defeat, he lifted his right hand, and with a wave, all the Dharmic Artifacts instantly flew toward him.</p> <p>From afar, this scene was shocking. Under the lights emanating from the dozens of Dharma treasures that were surrounding Wang Baole, he seemed to glow. This scene was etched in the minds of the tens of thousands of people on Upper Academy Island.</p> <p>It was also at this moment that a loud sound ensued. Lu Zihao had finally escaped the windstorm. Roaring, he rushed out with great force.</p> <p>\\u201cCome, fight me!\\u201d he exclaimed with imposing might. The Flying Frost Swords around him lost their chilliness. After taking a few steps, he stopped in his tracks, staring dumbly at the duo who were now glaring at him. He observed the Dharmic Artifacts surrounding Wang Baole and came to a realization. His body started shaking, and his eyes became even more bloodshot.</p> <p>\\u201cWang Baole! Didn\\u2019t you say that you wouldn\\u2019t attack? You stole my limelight again!\\u201d Lu Zihao roared, anger and sadness bubbling within him.</p> <p>Wang Baole glared at him. He was about to say something when the duo snorted coldly.</p> <p>\\u201cLu Zihao, stop acting already. As if all this wasn\\u2019t an act!\\u201d the duo exclaimed, glaring at him. They turned to Wang Baole, cupping their fists to salute him.</p> <p>\\u201cSenior Wang Baole, we accept this defeat wholeheartedly!\\u201d the duo declared, having calmed down. They thought of the attacks that Wang Baole had executed earlier and were deeply moved that Wang Baole did not embarrass them. All of his Dharmic Artifacts were very amazing.</p> <p>After the salute, the disciple from the array formation pavilion could not help but ask, \\u201cSenior Baole, are you selling the Dharmic Artifacts that you used just now?\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cYes, I am!\\u201d Wang Baole replied, his eyes brightening. Hurriedly, he went forward to exchange voice transmission numbers with the duo, happily offering them discounts. In no time, the three of them hit it off. Wang Baole even walked a few steps with them as he sent them off, waving as he did.</p> <p>Lu Zihao was raging at the sight that unfolded before him. His brain was about to explode. Feeling very wronged, he let out another roar.</p> <p>\\u201cWang Baole, you\\u2026\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll give you two of the five Flying Frost Swords that are beside you!\\u201d Wang Baole interrupted, waving his hand with great generosity. He knew Lu Zihao\\u2019s character. He refused to lower himself to a child\\u2019s level. The matter could be solved with a few pieces of candy.</p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2026 I, Lu Zihao, am a man of principle!\\u201d Lu Zihao exclaimed, his eyes widening. In an instant, his vigor dwindled uncontrollably, but he became angrier.</p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll give them all to you!\\u201d Wang Baole offered, raising an eyebrow.</p> <p>Lu Zihao took a deep breath. Since it had already happened, whatever he said would be of no use. Besides, the assistant could only help out in four battles. As of now, there was only one battle left. Once it was over, it did not matter whether it was the final battle or the second stage of the competitions\\u2014he would not have to see Wang Baole again.</p> <p>Most importantly, when his principles were being tested, he did not fall for Wang Baole\\u2019s Trojan Horse. Once these thoughts flitted through his mind, Lu Zihao felt his anger dissipate. He wanted to snort, but recalling Wang Baole\\u2019s earlier reminder, he only snorted internally. With a gloomy expression, he whirled toward the fourth meeting point.</p> <p>This fourth meeting point was his assistant\\u2019s last battle!</p> <p>The tournament that took place there would determine the strongest competitor of each of the four sides of the mountain peak, and only those four competitors would be able to step onto the mountaintop for the battle of four. The last competitor standing on the mountain peak would then enter the second stage of the Combat Pavilion Tournament.</p> <p>Basically, those who could make it to the fourth meeting point were definitely not weak. Even as Lu Zihao approached, he tried to calm himself down, forcing himself to keep the utmost focus.</p> <p>From the perspective of the purpose of an assistant, in actual fact, Wang Baole had been very reliable, completing his tasks almost perfectly. Lu Zihao did not use many resources within the first three tournaments. In terms of energy and materials, Lu Zihao was at the peak.</p> <p>Lu Zihao was obviously not paying attention to Wang Baole. One after the other, they walked toward the fourth meeting point\\u2014the region near to the mountaintop. Following the merging of two roads, the end of the road was visible. There was a curtain of light, and beyond that was a road that led straight to the mountain peak.</p> <p>Wang Baole was in a good mood, so he did not pick a fight with Lu Zihao. He felt that he had accomplished his mission already and was very relaxed. His mind was filled with images of an abundance of filled order forms once he returned from his assisting role.</p> <p><em>I should be able to make a killing this time. It should be sufficient to sustain my research and cultivation,\\u00a0</em>Wang Baole thought, filled with joy. He hummed a tune, strolling forward with his hands behind his back. As Lu Zihao got closer to the meeting point, he stopped dead in his tracks.</p> <p>It was as though every single hair on his body was standing on end. Sweating, Lu Zihao took a deep breath, making his heart pump faster. There was a serious, grave expression on his face as he saw the two figures at the fourth meeting point.</p> <p>\\u201cWang Baole, you\\u2026 you need to help me this time\\u2026\\u201d Lu Zihao took a deep breath and stammered in a low voice. When Wang Baole heard his words, he was surprised. As he got closer, he also saw the two figures.</p> <p>One of them was meditating while the other seemed to be a bodyguard standing beside him!</p> <p>The guard was strong-built, wore a purple armor, and had long hair that blew in the wind. He appeared like a small mountain standing there. The aura that he exuded was akin to the peak of True Breath, and it seemed like he could surpass this level any time.</p> <p>Looking at him was like looking at a terrifying beast. Extremely obvious was his fierce gaze, as though he was a volcano that was about to explode!</p> <p>Compared to him, the meditating youth had a different aura and gave off a different vibe. He exuded an aura of peace and indifference, as though few happenings in the world could gain his attention.</p> <p>Although he was bald, he was still handsome. He seemed gentle and frail-looking. His eyes were closed as if he was sensing something. Gentle winds circulated around him, as though they were attracted to him.</p> <p>This person was none other than the nameless Dao Enlightenment faculty disciple, the one who had made a drop of water appear in an empty cup\\u2014out of thin air\\u2014just by focusing on it, back then on the peak of the mountain in the Dao Enlightenment faculty!</p> <p>Also\\u2026 he was the only personal disciple of the former Federation President, the present Grand Supreme Elder of Ethereal Dao College!</p> <p>Although Wang Baole did not know him, the moment that he saw the bald youth, his footsteps also slowly came to a halt. He realized why the proud Lu Zihao had asked for his help. In actual fact\\u2026 the guard was nothing, but this meditating youth exuded an oppressive force that was like a sharp, invisible knife pointing between one\\u2019s eyebrows</p> <p>Wang Baole squinted and retracted his smile. He was no longer relaxed, and his eyes instantly glimmered a keenness.</p> <p>In that split second when Wang Baole looked at the bald youth, the latter\\u2026 opened his eyes!</p>\", \"Chapter 153: Can You Speak Normally?\": \"<p>As the bald youth\\u2019s eyes opened, they had an inexplicable attractiveness. His clear eyes, looking pure as water, seemed like they could suck one\\u2019s state of mind into them and cause one to be thrown into confusion.</p> <p>They might even have the illusion that their opponent\\u2019s body was exuding rays of light, as though he was a deity. The resulting feeling, wanting to worship the opponent, made Wang Baole shudder. His cultivation within his body started circulating immediately, and right at that moment, his devouring seed rotated slightly. As his cultivation circulated around his body, even Wang Baole himself did not notice that deep within his pupils, a purple glow flashed past!</p> <p>After Wang Baole absorbed the purple light in the Spirit Breath Village, it had integrated with his devouring seed. This formed a strange light\\u2014the purple glow that flashed in his pupils. The moment it appeared, the meditating bald youth suddenly let out a soft gasp. His original calm, elegant expression also changed at that moment. When he looked toward Wang Baole, his expression changed to one showing interest.</p> <p>As his expression changed, the previously formed suppressive force immediately destabilized and dissipated. This caused Lu Zihao, who was walking forward as though he could not control his footsteps and whose body was shivering, to shudder as though he had just awoken from a dream. His breathing hastened, and he had a stunned expression.</p> <p>\\u201cWhat kind of spell is this!\\u201d Lu Zihao exclaimed, caution and shock appearing in his eyes.</p> <p>Not caring about Lu Zihao\\u2019s reaction, the bald youth tilted his head slightly, with his posture showing a nobility seemingly deeply rooted within him. The guard beside him\\u2014the contestant from the Combat Pavilion\\u2014immediately bowed down to listen, nodding for a moment. After that, he got up and walked toward Lu Zihao until he reached the center of the meeting point. He raised his arm and beckoned Lu Zihao, as though challenging him to a duel!</p> <p>Lu Zihao\\u2019s expression changed, and he looked toward the bald youth with fear. Then he looked toward Wang Baole, his eyes pleading for help. It did not matter how proud he was\\u2014he put that all away at that moment. He knew that this battle would be extremely arduous because his opponent was too strong. But in his heart, Wang Baole was just as strong, so he instinctively looked toward him for help.</p> <p>\\u201cYou even have a guard? Stop acting high and mighty!\\u201d Wang Baole furrowed his eyebrows and let out a cold snort. He could not get used to the bald youth\\u2019s posture just now, but at the same time, he also felt the suppressive force emanating from the bald youth\\u2019s body. Wang Baole felt that the bald youth was the strongest opponent that he had ever met in the same cultivation realm as him. Hence, he followed the bald youth and sat cross-legged, speaking calmly.</p> <p>\\u201cZihao, there\\u2019s no harm in fighting. This is your big competition! If it\\u2019s one on one, it\\u2019s your issue whether you win or lose. But if it\\u2019s two on one, it depends on whether I, Wang Baole, agree!\\u201d</p> <p>Hearing Wang Baole\\u2019s words, Lu Zihao heaved a sigh of relief. Although he disliked Wang Baole and could not see eye to eye with him, Wang Baole\\u2019s words made him feel more comforted. At that moment, after he raised his head to look at the purple-armored cultivator beckoning him, fighting spirit exploded in Lu Zihao\\u2019s eyes. He let out a low growl and shot toward the purple-armored cultivator.</p> <p>With tremendous speed, he got close to the purple-armored cultivator instantly. With a few hand seals, he sent the five Flying Frost Swords surrounding him flying and threw out multiple amulets, transforming them into spells with a bang. Meanwhile, a cold smile appeared on the purple-armored cultivator\\u2019s face as he strode forward and stomped with his right foot. Immediately, Spirit Qi exploded from under his feet like a storm, and he burst toward Lu Zihao.</p> <p>Obviously, Lu Zihao had the upper hand in terms of agility and speed. At that moment, he dodged by phasing his figure away and attacked again.</p> <p>In a flash, the two of them clashed together in the middle of the meeting point.</p> <p>In this battle, even though Wang Baole did not set off fireworks, he still attracted the attention of the Federation officials, the Army, and Ethereal Dao College\\u2019s elders who were watching from the viewing platform in the sky.</p> <p>\\u201cIs he that person\\u2019s disciple?\\u201d On the Army\\u2019s viewing platform, General Zhou narrowed his eyes slightly, his gaze landing on the bald youth.</p> <p>\\u201cThis person is named Li\\u00a0Wuchen\\u00a0<sup>1</sup>\\u00a0. He\\u2019s the only personal disciple of Ethereal Dao College\\u2019s Grand Supreme Elder. With my authority, I can\\u2019t see his background and dossier,\\u201d Zhou Lu whispered at his side.</p> <p>\\u201cOf course you can\\u2019t see it\\u2026 He should be twenty years old this year\\u2026\\u201d General Zhou\\u2019s eyes showed deep thought, and a cold glint gradually appearing in his pupils. However, he quickly suppressed it. He repeated the bald youth\\u2019s name in his heart a few times and remained silent.</p> <p>At the same time, the Federation officials all looked toward the bald youth. Obviously, they knew whom his master was, but they did not have as weird a reaction as General Zhou. At the very most, they only paid closer attention to him.</p> <p>But all the Elders of Ethereal Dao College had complicated expressions when they saw the bald youth. Even the middle-aged man in red robes had such an expression. Deep within his eyes, where others could not see, a cold glint flashed as well.</p> <p>As booms reverberated around the meeting point at that moment, Wang Baole and the bald youth were both meditating. They gazed at each other, as though they were facing off. After a while, Wang Baole felt a little bored and coughed.</p> <p>\\u201cSenior Brother, why do you keep looking at me?\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019m looking at your past and present lives,\\u201d the bald youth replied calmly.</p> <p>After hearing that, Wang Baole had an odd expression on his face. He felt that this guy was crazy.</p> <p>At that moment, Lu Zihao\\u2019s duel with the purple-armored cultivator at the meeting point became increasingly intense, and it was obvious that Lu Zihao was at a disadvantage. After all, it was obvious that his cultivation level and battle experience could not compare to that of the purple-armored cultivator.</p> <p>Just as he was about to lose, the purple-armored cultivator suddenly retreated. In a flash, he returned to the bald youth\\u2019s side with a shake of his body and bowed toward Lu Zihao with cupped fists.</p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a draw!\\u201d</p> <p>Lu Zihao was taken aback. As he was about to speak, a strange glow suddenly appeared in the bald youth\\u2019s eyes. He lifted his chin slightly and spoke softly while looking at Wang Baole.</p> <p>\\u201cNow, let\\u2019s duel!\\u201d</p> <p>Lu Zihao\\u2019s breathing hastened; he looked at the bald youth then looked toward Wang Baole. No matter how slow his reaction speed was, he understood that at this moment, his opponents\\u2019 target was not himself at all. It was Wang Baole!</p> <p>He even suspected that his opponents might have used an unknown method to him to find out that Wang Baole was assisting him, choosing to join the competition because of that. Without a doubt, their backgrounds were extraordinary; that was why they could meet Wang Baole and have this battle with him in the end!</p> <p>With those thoughts in mind, Lu Zihao had a conflicted look, but he did not say any more. Instead, he returned to Wang Baole\\u2019s side and remained silent.</p> <p>Wang Baole raised his head and gazed at the bald youth. Actually, from the moment he first looked at the bald youth, he already had the feeling that the bald youth was sitting there as though he was waiting for him.</p> <p>But that felt a bit ridiculous, so Wang Baole did not think much of it. However, seeing how obvious the bald youth\\u2019s actions and words were, he could not help but ask, \\u201cDo we know each other?\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cMaster said that a few people have tremendous potential and let me invite them to work together and support one another. You\\u2019re one of them, but I feel that you\\u2019re just ordinary. However, I thought about giving you a chance, so I looked for you to test you in a battle!\\u201d The bald youth raised his head and spoke calmly. As he spoke, it seemed like a certain aura was emanating from his body.</p> <p>\\u201cCan you speak normally? Can you stop posturing?\\u201d Wang Baole seemed speechless and raised his hand to smack his forehead. However, at the moment he raised his hand, he did not smack it against his forehead. Instead, he turned his palm over and slammed it toward the ground.</p> <p>With a boom, his body left the ground like a hare using the force from the slam. Like an arrow shot from a bow, he burst toward the bald youth instantly with his body almost pressed toward the ground.</p> <p>His actions were as smooth as flowing water, unexpected and cleanly executed. At that moment, Wang Baole\\u2019s speed was released without reservation, causing him to look like he was flying. His cultivation erupted completely, conjuring Spirit Qi storms around his body. From afar, he looked imposing. Getting close to the bald youth in the blink of an eye, he grabbed toward him.</p> <p>All this happened too fast, and the bald youth was stunned for a moment, obviously not given enough time to react. However, it was as though the sole purpose in life of the guard at his side\\u2014the purple-armored cultivator\\u2014was to protect Li Wuchen. Being well-versed in combat and constantly monitoring Wang Baole\\u2019s actions, he actually stepped out and blocked Wang Baole at that moment.</p> <p>A boom immediately sounded, and the purple-armored cultivator\\u2019s body shook violently. Shock appeared in his expression, and he retreated dejectedly while fresh blood leaked from the corner of his mouth. Nonetheless, his block had some effect, causing Wang Baole to slow down a bit.</p> <p>The bald youth\\u2019s breathing hastened, using this split second to retreat backward rapidly just as Wang Baole got close. He dodged Wang Baole\\u2019s grab, and it whizzed past his face. He raised his right hand, pressing toward Wang Baole through the air.</p> <p>Immediately, a huge boom sounded between the two of them, and a strong force exploded forth. It forced Wang Baole, raring to charge forward again, to take many steps backward, and regret appeared in his gaze.</p> <p>\\u201cYour reaction speed is pretty fast, but it\\u2019s a two on one, so you can\\u2019t be considered a true man.\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re shameless, you ambushed me!\\u201d the bald youth exclaimed angrily. He could not remain calm at that moment and retreated backward rapidly.</p> <p>\\u201cFinally, not posturing?\\u201d Wang Baole glared at him.</p> <p>Everyone who saw that scene on the sky platform had pleasant looks of surprise. That was especially so for General Zhou and the Red-robed Cultivator. The both of them had radiant glows in their eyes.</p> <p>\\u201cNice!\\u201d</p> <p>However, Zhou Lu seemed very unhappy and muttered, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a sneak attack. It can\\u2019t be considered as glorious!\\u201d</p> <p>\\u201cDid your brain get damaged from studying too much at White Deer Dao College? Pedantic!\\u201d General Zhou furrowed his eyebrows and, in a rare occurrence, berated Zhou Lu.</p>\"}, \"links\": [\"https://boxnovel.com/novel/a-world-worth-protecting/chapter-150\", \"https://boxnovel.com/novel/a-world-worth-protecting/chapter-151\", \"https://boxnovel.com/novel/a-world-worth-protecting/chapter-152\", \"https://boxnovel.com/novel/a-world-worth-protecting/chapter-153\"]}\n"
