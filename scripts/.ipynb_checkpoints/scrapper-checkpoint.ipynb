       "['<p>On a scorching summer day, east of the Federation, fog emanated through Pond Cloud Rainforest like thin chiffon. Ancient towering trees interlocked each other, and birds would occasionally flit through the lush tree crowns, chirping as they flapped their wings and flew across the horizon.</p> <p>High in the sky, the sun, which had seemed capable of existing eternally, no longer appeared anything like how people remembered. Instead, it had been penetrated by an ancient greenish-bronze sword—one so indescribably massive—many years ago! Only a small portion of the sword’s tip was exposed!</p> <p>The ancient sword had come from the cosmos and seemed to express its antiquity. There was a potent suppressive force that formed a halo, which enveloped the firmament as though it held the land in place, letting all life revere it!</p> <p>The Sword Sun and the rainforest looked picturesque from afar but was disturbed by a humming sound that came from a distance. A red hot-air balloon flew slowly toward the rainforest.</p> <p>The hot-air balloon’s hull was very large, capable of holding hundreds of people. In there, many young men and women in groups of three or four chatted happily.</p> <p>They were new students of Ethereal Dao College, one of the four great Dao Colleges in the Federation. They hailed from Phoenix City and were onboard Ethereal Dao College’s cruiser, traversing thousands of kilometers, to seek higher education.</p> <p>Perhaps because they were all greatly anticipating their upcoming education—not to mention the unspoken attraction between men and women—the students had plenty of fun on the five-thousand-kilometer voyage.</p> <p>Due to the long distance, the cruiser was equipped with dining halls, cultivation chambers, medical facilities, and many other amenities.</p> <p>There were quite a number of students in the cruiser’s dining hall. Sitting at a table was a young fatty with his belly bulging out.</p> <p>He was about seventeen years old, and he wore a blue baggy robe. His tiny rotund face could barely be considered to have intricate features. As he created smacking sounds while patting his belly, he gazed at the eight empty plates in front of him, a little regretful.</p> <p><em>I’ll have gained another one and a half kilograms after this meal. Why didn’t I bear with it? I can’t die early if I want to become the Federation President.\\xa0</em>The fatty frowned with a grimace as he felt filled with regret, burping in the process.</p> <p>The young fatty’s name was Wang Baole. He was also one of the students who had recently been accepted into Ethereal Dao College. His lifelong dream was to become an official, or more precisely, become the Federation President. The reason he had such an ambitious dream was intricately tied to a childhood experience of his.</p> <p>In his memories, his father would frequently pat him on the head while speaking earnestly and sighing wistfully.</p> <p>“Baole, being an official is the best. Remember, although money can solve everything, you can still be bullied by others. If you do not want to be bullied, the only way is to be an official, becoming a person who lords over the rest.”</p> <p>Wang Baole did not understand his father’s words until he entered elementary school. One fateful day, he failed to hand in his homework on time and ended up being berated by the class monitor. Despite giving the class monitor two sweets, his name was still jotted down, and the class monitor snitched on him. All of this left a permanent mark in his young heart.</p> <p>Hence, he wished to become the class monitor from that moment forth. It was not to bully others, but to ensure that he would not be bullied by others.</p> <p>But as he grew up, he realized that many people bullied the class monitors. Therefore, he felt that only by becoming the highest official—the Federation President—could he ensure that no one would dare bully him. The reason he had racked his brains to enter Ethereal Dao College was because all the Federation’s high officials had graduated from the four great Dao Colleges.</p> <p>However, he did not lead a blessed life. His family clan’s bloodline was quite an oddity. He even remembered that night one year ago when his father, who could be described as a bag of bones, had shown him the family tree.</p> <p>It was the first time Wang Baole had seen it. He realized that all his ancestors had died early—before the age of thirty-five—if their body weight exceeded a hundred kilograms.</p> <p>That night, Wang Baole had a dream… He had reunited with his fat forefathers before he successfully became the Federation President.</p> <p>The matter of losing weight was elevated to something of great importance over the following year. The Spirit Inception Era meant rich Spirit Qi and a renewed interest in ancient martial arts; therefore, there were many weight-loss techniques. However, Wang Baole’s weight remained stable, despite the new era. He even experienced a slight rise in weight even after he attempted all of them.</p> <p>As his memories surfaced, Wang Baole gritted his teeth, steeling his resolve to begin losing weight the next day.</p> <p>Having made up his mind, Wang Baole immediately felt relieved. As he picked his teeth, he hummed a tune while looking at the distant blue sky outside the windows. His mind became active again.</p> <p><em>I wonder if Physician Lu likes the gift I gave him. That is an antique I got from home. That old geezer will probably like it.\\xa0</em>Wang Baole comforted himself and guessed that if he managed to win Physician Lu’s favor, it would be equivalent to him having a tiny backer in the Dao College.</p> <p><em>Teachers have limits to their authority, but I still have to give them some gifts in the future. Being so old, Physician Lu definitely has quite a wide social circle. I have likely taken the right step.\\xa0</em>Upon thinking of this, Wang Baole felt delighted. In his mind, he was one step closer to the position of the Federation President.</p> <p>In regard to becoming the Federation President, he was very confident. This confidence stemmed from his research of the autobiographies of high officials, which he had gathered from a young age. He had even figured out a few trump cards needed in order to become a high official.</p> <p>He was in a good mood as he looked at the blue skies outside the window, finding it especially beautiful.</p> <p>But then, his eyes suddenly widened. He noticed that a black cloud was gathering in the distant sky. It spread out, covering the sky as lightning bolts flashed within it. The cloud slowly approached, and it also gained the attention of many as they exclaimed.</p> <p>“It’s an electromagnetic pulse!”</p> <p>Wang Baole was alarmed as well. After the Spirit Inception Era was ushered in, the appearance of Spirit Qi caused many stunning phenomena to arise in the world. Flying crafts from the past could no longer ensure safe travel. It resulted in the production of hot-air balloon cruisers propelled by Spirit Stones.</p> <p>Amid constant exclamations, a rumbling thunder suddenly boomed. The black electromagnetic clouds burgeoned in size rapidly as the lightning within began spreading outward. Like a black net, it illuminated the horizons in a dazzling manner, causing the hearts of the spectators to race. Even the cruiser slowed down.</p> <p>Just as people were feeling apprehensive, the door to the dining hall was pushed open. As though a cool wind had rushed in, a white-robed elder entered. His face was covered in wrinkles, but he had an ethereal air to him. His appearance exuded a feeling of propriety, especially his shimmering eyes, making him look like a person of righteousness. The moment he arrived, his domineering voice resounded throughout the dining hall.</p> <p>“Everyone is to immediately report to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber. Wear your Magnetic Spirit attire, for we will be entering the electromagnetic domain in less than three minutes!”</p> <p>The moment he spoke, all the students in the dining hall hurriedly stood up reverently.</p> <p>Wang Baole’s eyes lit up. The elder in front of him was Physician Lu, the person he had previously gifted. From how he walked with flair, Wang Baole was increasingly convinced that his investment from before was right. He thought to himself that the old man was likely someone extraordinary, and he had really made the right move.</p> <p>Just as he was reveling in his delight, the old physician swept his gaze across the room and saw Wang Baole. With a snort, he walked over, took out half a black mask, and threw it at him.</p> <p>“Don’t waste your efforts on such inane acts when you are still so young. To think you have already learned the art of gifting before you’ve even entered the Dao College. I’m quite a learned person with experience. Keep the mask for yourself.” The old physician’s expression was solemn. He reprimanded Wang Baole with an honest and upright demeanor, as though he expected better from him.</p> <p>Wang Baole received the mask as his heart skipped a beat. He turned somewhat worried, as he could tell that the old physician was angry. Just as he was about to give an explanation, he suddenly recalled one of the trump cards he had learned from the high officials’ autobiographies. One of them was that it was wise to thicken one’s skin to admit one’s mistakes in front of a superior. Typically, that would reduce a major issue to a minor one.</p> <p>Therefore, he took a deep breath and hurriedly took on a contrite and penitent look to admit his fault.</p> <p>“Teacher, you are right; I was at fault!”</p> <p>The old physician turned a little intrigued. He could not deliver his planned tirade when the student had admitted his mistake so readily.</p> <p>Wang Baole heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the old physician’s expression. He felt a little smug, thinking how useful the high officials’ autobiographies were.</p> <p>The old physician snorted, raised his head, and scanned all the students in the dining hall. He raised his right hand and pointed at them.</p> <p>“And all of you. All of you are future students of our Ethereal Dao College, but look at what you have been doing the past few days. You have to forever remember that, as warriors, we should first establish ourselves, watch our speech, and finally mind our conduct!”</p> <p>The vice-abhorring physician’s words resounded through the dining hall. Everyone who heard it could not help but lower their heads in shame. As for Wang Baole, his eyes immediately lit up. He felt it was the appropriate moment for him to shine.</p> <p>He quickly took out a tiny notebook and began writing on it. From time to time, he would raise his head to look at the old physician with a diligent and attentive look on his face. At times, he would even nod seriously as though he was trying to remember every single word. Obviously, this was also from the teachings in the high officials’ autobiographies.</p> <p>When his other classmates saw this, they looked at Wang Baole as though they were looking at a man of God.</p> <p>The old physician momentarily fell into a daze when he saw this. An unprecedented sense of oddness arose in his heart. This was the first time he had encountered such an oddity after enrolling so many batches of students. He could not help but take a few looks at him before he slowly sneered.</p> <p>“Little fellow, it’s not that easy to suck up to me. You ought to thank the electromagnetic pulse. If not for that, I would have reprimanded you for three days and three nights. I would be rather interested to see if you can write all of that in your tiny notebook!”</p> <p>The moment he said those words, the mood immediately changed. The aura of an expert emanated from his body as it seemed to manifest as a suppressive force that blanketed the entire dining hall. Every student became alarmed. They all felt that the old physician clearly had the upper hand in the battle of wits.</p> <p>Wang Baole blinked as he touched the recording jade slip in his pocket. After weighing the situation and noticing how they were approaching the electromagnetic pulse steadily, he gave up the thought of taking it out. He felt that backing down in front of a superior was nothing embarrassing.</p> <p>The old physician became delighted when he saw the expressions on everyone. He generously threw them a few more words of motivation.</p> <p>“Remember, put all your effort into cultivating. In the future, you must not be greedy or deceitful. Don’t even think about finding girlfriends. I have to make it known to you that lust and danger are just two sides of the same coin! The way all of you have been acting for the past few days has been preposterous!”</p> <p>Just as he said that, a sweet voice suddenly sounded from the old physician’s voice transmission bangle.</p> <p>“Grandpa Physician, where are you? Where do the Magnetic Spirit clothes go on? What should it cover? Quick, come and help me.”</p> <p>The charming voice made the old physician tremble involuntarily. He barely forced a dry cough as he stared sternly at everyone. Only then did he turn around in a rush, and at the same time, he spoke excitedly into the voice transmission bangle. “Oh, I’m coming. Baby, don’t fret. I’m coming to help you right now.”</p> <p>The turn of events had simply happened too quickly, and the contrast was striking. Everyone was dumbfounded, and even Wang Baole was taken aback. He drew a deep breath moments later. Following that, there was an uproar as Wang Baole clenched his teeth and cursed.</p> <p><em>Shameless! What that old pervert said was utter bullshit! There are only so many female schoolmates. There aren’t enough for all of us, but he is actually trying to snatch resources from us at his age. Isn’t it all because he’s some kind of official?</em></p> <p>Wang Baole became more infuriated the more he thought about the matter. He joined in the conversations with the classmates around him. It only strengthened his determination to become an official.</p> <p>Another alarm sounded, ending everyone’s conversations. All of them immediately rushed to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber.</p> <p>The Spirit Cultivation Chamber was located in the core region of the cruiser, and like its name, it was a place for students to cultivate. At the same time, it was the place where the most security was deployed whenever the cruiser crossed any special zones.</p> <p>As people gathered in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, they were made to sit in rows under the direction of the Ethereal Dao College teachers. They were dressed in the Magnetic Spirit clothes that Ethereal Dao College had handed out.</p> <p>Wang Baole was still dwelling on his anger toward Physician Lu even after he changed into the Magnetic Spirit clothes. He casually looked up and surveyed his surroundings. His depression immediately turned for the worse when he spotted a certain someone. He could not help but furrow his brows as he gave a look of disparagement.</p> <p>Sitting where his sight had landed was a girl with long, slender legs. She looked charming, but she had her brows knitted and a look of disgust, too. Clearly, they were very familiar with each other but also hated each other from the looks they were giving one another.</p> <p><em>What bad luck!</em></p> <p>Both of them grumbled inwardly as they looked away. It was as though just a glance of each other was a sore sight.</p> <p>“I see that flat-chested Du Min, everywhere I go. How irritating!” Wang Baole muttered under his breath. He had been classmates with the girl, Du Min, ever since he began schooling. She was usually proud and aloof, and she constantly made things difficult for him as her role as class monitor. She also happened to be the receiver of the two sweets he had given back then.</p> <p>“What’s so impressive about her? Isn’t she just some lame class monitor? When we arrive at the Dao Colleges, I’ll use the teachings of the officials and get some kind of official role!” snorted Wang Baole.</p> <p>Soon, everyone had changed their clothing. The teachers in the Ethereal Dao College cruiser checked everyone’s attire and explained certain important matters. They also warned everyone that things could become dangerous once the cruiser entered the electromagnetic domain. The risk of death was not negligible.</p> <p>After everyone’s expression changed, the teachers left solemnly. The door to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber was sealed as the lights dimmed.</p> <p>Although there were murmurs in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, the nervousness people felt turned more intense over the passage of time. Gradually, no one spoke as the chamber fell into silence.</p> <p>It got so quiet that they could hear their own heartbeats. Even Wang Baole, who still felt disgruntled, turned nervous. As the remaining minutes counted down, the entire cruiser suddenly shook, signifying its entry into the electromagnetic domain!</p> <p>Outside, the black electromagnetic clouds looked extremely grand. It resembled a huge mouth that seemed to devour the tiny hot-air balloon cruiser.</p> <p>This phenomenon contained a destructive might that could sweep away everything. Perhaps only the stunning Sword Sun above the heavens could ignore such destruction, as though it could weather that turmoil and anything else thrown at it for millennia to come.</p> <p>This year was the 37th year of the Spirit Inception Era.</p> <p>In A.D. 3029, Earth’s technology progressed rapidly, and the world was united with no national borders. It entered a federation era, and it was during this period that the massive sword flew from the cosmos and penetrated the sun, sending shockwaves across the world.</p> <p>The hilt of the sword might have been damaged from the beginning, but the powerful impact shattered it into numerous fragments, which scattered across space, with portions of it landing all over the Earth.</p> <p>Accompanying the arrival of the greenish-bronze sword and the falling of the fragments, the Earth suddenly had a perpetual new source of energy that permeated everywhere. It was later named… Spirit Qi!</p> <p>Spirit Qi was like air. Some places were denser and others thinner. The Federation and other factions obtained the scattered fragments, and through them, found the relevant information needed for cultivation training and cultivation artifacts, pill refinement, and Spirit Stone refinement. The text on the fragments looked ancient, which made people’s interest in ancient texts become mainstream.</p> <p>The appearance of Spirit Qi quickly eliminated the need for all existing resources. It changed the lives of people and formed the Spirit Internet. It also changed the progress of Earth’s civilization. It initiated a cultivation civilization all over Earth.</p> <p>From then on, ancient martial arts became popular as a revolutionary change happened throughout the world. Thus, the era of immortal cultivation began.</p> <p>History called it the Spirit Inception Era.</p> <p>In the black electromagnetic cloud, the red hot-air balloon cruiser slowly proceeded forward. Lightning flashed continuously as bolt after bolt struck the cruiser incessantly. Thankfully, there was a soft halo surrounding the cruiser, allowing it to fly stably.</p> <p>As for the Spirit Cultivation Chamber in the cruiser’s core, all the students, including Wang Baole, were in there. They had unknowingly fallen asleep as though there was a strange power that pulled them into a dream.</p> <p>At the cruiser’s helm were eight teachers. Some of them were drinking tea while others were smiling. They were having light-hearted conversations, looking completely different from when they frightened their students.</p> <p>Their leader was an elder with a face covered in wrinkles. He held a smoke pipe as he sucked on it. If Wang Baole was here, he would definitely have recognized him as the shameless Physician Lu.</p> <p>The old physician smiled faintly when a middle-aged teacher asked, “Chancellor, everything is in order. Shall we begin the trial for this student cohort?”</p> <p>“Begin!”</p>',\n",
       " '<p>The bright moon illuminated the nearly starless evening sky.</p> <p>It was still the same Pond Cloud Rainforest, but there was an additional chilly air to the night. Occasionally, one would see rivers formed from the accumulation of rainwater, which appeared charming under the moonlight. However, the cries of beasts or birds easily left one feeling uneasy.</p> <p>In a corner of the Pond Cloud Rainforest beside a river, there were two girls who looked a little wretched, but still innocent. One of them was tall, and the other looked adorable, each possessing a unique charm. The tall girl was watching her surroundings nervously while the adorable girl took off her undergarments, revealing her snow-white skin. She winced as she massaged the wound around her armpit. She had a chaotic look in her eyes as she muttered softly, “Du Min, it has been three days. Who knows when rescue will come? Our camp is quickly running out of food.”</p> <p>The tall girl, Du Min, fell silent when she heard that. She felt her life had changed completely over the past three days. She had been a student of Ethereal Dao College three days ago, but now, she was lost in a land filled with danger.</p> <p>The Pond Cloud Rainforest looked beautiful, but in fact, its ground was moist and filled with decay. Animal bones could be seen from time to time, and there were many foot-long centipedes and colorful snakes making their occasional appearances. The sight left one’s scalp tingling.</p> <p>Animals had also evolved rapidly, like humans, ever since the Spirit Inception Era. They had great strength and were extremely savage. It made the wilderness a forbidden zone for humans.</p> <p>As the two girls agonized over their predicament, a fatty who had an unyielding look on his face stood not far from them under a tree. With his head up, he stood there peeing.</p> <p>The fatty was none other than Wang Baole. He had not noticed the two girls, nor did he see the tiny flowers beneath his feet. They had originally stood tall and proud, but now, the flowers were swaying wildly because of the stream of pee.</p> <p><em>Darn it. I, Wang Baole, have always claimed to be able to read people, seeing through the hearts of all. I never expected that I would fall for Ethereal Dao College’s scheme!</em></p> <p><em>This Ethereal Dao College is way too wicked. They managed to put on such a realistic act. To convince us of the situation, they even made everyone see the cruiser explode!</em></p> <p>Wang Baole was infuriated deep down. The past three days had truly put him on tenterhooks.</p> <p>Three days ago, he and his schoolmates had fallen asleep in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber without even realizing it. They were awoken by a loud bang and before they could even get their bearings, their bodies were thrown right out of the cruiser by a powerful impact.</p> <p>Thankfully, the Magnetic Spirit attire had the ability to reduce shock and repel lightning. He had landed in the Pond Cloud Rainforest safely but had then witnessed the cruiser explode amid the electromagnetic pulse.</p> <p>Wang Baole and the others found themselves scattered across the forest. There was a lack of food, and the beasts were ferocious. Their future was still a question mark, and the horror the students faced made them change drastically. Some revealed their true characters. Others formed groups, and a few forged ahead alone. Some were decisive, and some were weak.</p> <p>The concept of survival of the fittest was just too jarring and sudden for these students who had just been enrolled into Ethereal Dao College. But under such a drastic change, it seemed to trigger certain things in them. Be it greed or ferocity, selflessness or kindness, all of them sprouted and were magnified.</p> <p>“Shameless!” Wang Baole grumbled deep down. He had believed everything he encountered the past three days to be real. He had been so frightened that he had put up with the thought of staying in the camp of his archrival, Du Min, when he bumped into her.</p> <p>After three days passed, he realized that by not eating proper meals, he had miraculously lost about three kilograms through his voice transmission ring’s weight-measuring feature. His shock from the revelation turned into suspicion.</p> <p>This was just too different from the experience Wang Baole had in the past. He had once fasted and worked out crazily for a month in order to lose weight, but for an unknown reason, not only did he not lose weight, he even gained one and a half kilograms!</p> <p>Now, he had lost about three kilograms in three days. That was completely impossible for him!</p> <p>Especially when he recalled the autobiographies he had read. In them, people reminisced on their days in their respective Dao Colleges and seemed to mention, in vague terms, that the Dao Colleges would have so-called freshman tests from time to time.</p> <p>If not for Wang Baole’s thorough research, it would have been very difficult for him to have noticed this point. Having connected the dots together, he was baffled by how everything that had happened was done so realistically by Ethereal Dao College. It was very likely that there had only been a slip up because they had designed the experience based on an ordinary person. But clearly, he was no ordinary person.</p> <p>He was fifty percent certain that everything he saw in front of him was an illusion.</p> <p>And the evidence that fully convinced him of his theory was… the black half-mask that the old physician had returned to him!</p> <p>With this thought in mind, the peeing Wang Baole could not help but lower his head to look at his chest. An indescribable sense of peculiarity arose in his heart.</p> <p>He acutely remembered that he had casually kept the black half-mask close to his chest before he stepped into the Spirit Cultivation Chamber. After the terrifying turn of events, he’d had no time to even think about it. It was only moments ago that he realized by sheer chance that his hand could pass through the mask, despite it looking normal. It was as though he could not touch the mask.</p> <p>It seemed like the virtual world, which could replicate almost anything, found it difficult to decompose the mask’s components to model it.</p> <p>And with the passage of time, even its external shape had begun to turn unreal. At the same time, it exuded some blurry fragments of text.</p> <p>Although he could not read it clearly, the changes in the mask made Wang Baole’s confidence in his theory go from fifty percent to a hundred percent!</p> <p>If he continued analyzing according to his theory, it was not hard to guess the goal of the test with the fake catastrophe as its backstory.</p> <p><em>It’s impossible for it to be a measure of strength. After all, everyone has yet to study any ancient martial arts. Then, the goal of this test must be to test one’s mettle in the face of danger. Perhaps it’s also to test one’s confidence in the Dao College?</em></p> <p>As Wang Baole peed, his mind whirled constantly. From time to time, he would even have a few pee shivers.</p> <p>As the tiny flower in front of him was getting pelted into a mess, Wang Baole’s breathing hastened a little. He felt that he had to grasp the opportunity in front of him to gain bonus points.</p> <p><em>That’s what I’ll do!\\xa0</em>Upon coming to this conclusion, Wang Baole shook himself vigorously, and just as he was about to pull up his pants, he suddenly saw the tiny river not far away.</p> <p>Under the moonlight, although Du Min was standing there, Wang Baole’s eyes were not on her. They were fixated on the adorable girl who was cleaning her wound.</p> <p><em>There’s a humanoid beast!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole’s eyes widened as he gasped. His heart raced when he</p> <p>caught sight of them. Du Min, who remained vigilant of her surroundings, sensed the gaze. She looked over, and her eyes met Wang Baole’s. After a moment of shock, her expression changed, but before she could scream, Wang Baole glared at her, pulled up his pants, and shouted first.</p> <p>“What are you looking at? Have you never seen a man pee?”</p> <p>The moment he said that, Du Min choked from all the things that she wanted to say. She trembled in rage, for she had never met another man as shameless as Wang Baole. She could not help but curse.</p> <p>“Darn Fatty, you call yourself a man?”</p> <p>Wang Baole nearly swelled in anger when he heard that. The snarky Du Min had been his archrival since he was young. They felt repulsed by the sight of each other, and in a twist of fate, they had always been in the same class. Now, they had both enrolled in Ethereal Dao College. Wang Baole took a deep breath and scoffed.</p> <p>“Darn Washboard, you call yourself a woman?”</p> <p>Du Min nearly spat out a mouthful of blood when she heard the biting remark. A vein protruded from her forehead, and just as she was about to charge over, Wang Baole let out a long sigh.</p> <p>“My untainted body has been completely seen by the two of you. How can I live on?” He looked as though life held nothing more for him as he pulled up his pants and ran off. His heart was racing while cold sweat covered his back. He complimented himself for being quick to react, or else he would have been in trouble.</p> <p>Du Min widened her eyes angrily when she saw Wang Baole escaping. In response, she chased after him. As for the adorable girl in the river behind her, she had a bewildered look after hearing the duo’s biting exchange. She did not feel like Wang Baole had sexually harassed her. When she saw Du Min run off in pursuit, she donned her clothes and quickly chased after the duo with her face red.</p> <p>Du Min’s angry tirade broke the Pond Cloud Rainforest’s silence. People from the temporary encampment up ahead rushed over when they heard the disturbance, blocking Wang Baole from proceeding further.</p> <p>The person leading the group was a torch-wielding youth dressed in white. He had a burly build with eyebrows like swords and eyes like stars. He stood out from the crowd with many students surrounding him. Clearly, he was the leader.</p> <p>This person was Liu Daobin, the person who had united everyone in this encampment over the past three days, showcasing his personal charm.</p> <p>“Wang Baole, what did you do!” Liu Daobin noticed Du Min rushing over furiously at a glance. And Wang Baole, who was being pursued, was holding up his pants as he proceeded forward. Liu Daobin had been taken aback by such an odd scene. He had long taken a liking to Du Min, so he instinctively loathed Wang Baole.</p> <p>“All I did was pee…” Before Wang Baole could finish his sentence, they heard a loud scream coming from the two girls far away.</p> <p>A stench instantly permeated the area as soon as they heard the scream. Swashing sounds like waves crashing into the beach spread quickly like a storm passing through.</p> <p>Wang Baole jerked his head around, and at the same time, the expressions of Liu Daobin and the other students changed. They saw countless snakes slithering out from the ground and tree branches around Du Min and the adorable girl!</p> <p>The snakes looked extremely venomous, judging from the myriad of colors they could see. The numbers were just too great, and it looked like a sea of snakes was surrounding the two girls.</p> <p>The duo had a drastic change in expression when they saw the snakes surround them. It was even worse when the snakes opened their mouths lined with venomous fangs. Venomous liquid dripped down as they hissed. The stench was revolting.</p> <p>Liu Daobin jolted. He did not have the time to bother with Wang Baole. He charged straight for Du Min. There were a few other students who ran over to help with reddened eyes.</p> <p>All of this happened too quickly. At the instant everyone rushed over to help, there was an infantile cry coming from the distant forest. It left one’s heart palpitating. A red line, which was as thick as a human’s arm, could be seen clearly despite the darkness. It flitted over at an astounding speed.</p> <p>The body that leaped occasionally revealed a pale white head. It no longer looked like a snake’s head; it resembled that of a baby. However, the look in its eyes made everyone’s heart thump heavily.</p> <p>“Red Bone White Neonate Snake!” One of the students recognized it. Everyone panicked, and people retreated amid shocked exclamations.</p> <p>Liu Daobin became flustered as his hair stood on end. He felt his heart palpitating furiously. The Red Bone White Neonate Snake was simply too infamous. It was listed as one of the top thousand dangerous creatures in the Spirit Inception Era. Although its body was weak, it was very fast, and its venom was potent. Just being tainted by a sliver of its venom was enough to reduce one to a pool of blood, leaving the victim with only red bones. That was also how it had earned its name.</p> <p>Even though he liked Du Min, he instinctively felt that she was not worth losing his life for. He subconsciously took a step back to avoid the Red Bone White Neonate Snake, afraid that he and the rest would perish while it reveled in its murderous deeds.</p> <p>Wang Baole took a deep breath when he saw this scene. Following that, he immediately recalled that everything was, in fact, fake. He immediately relaxed as his eyes lit up. He knew his opportunity to shine in front of the teachers had appeared.</p> <p><em>Since it’s all fake, what’s there to be afraid of?\\xa0</em>Upon coming to this conclusion, Wang Baole immediately puffed out his chest and looked at his schoolmates, who were running away contemptibly.</p> <p>“Although the flat-chested Du Min, has a biting tongue and is ugly, and she is her always using her privileges to make things difficult for me, I, Wang Baole, am a person of sublime character, a righteous person, a man not afraid of sacrifice, a person who has transcended mediocrity, and someone who is willing to help his schoolmates!</p> <p>“In such a dangerous environment, how can I retreat? Others might be afraid to forge forward for fear of death, but… for my schoolmates, I have no fear!”</p> <p>The shameless fatty nearly moved himself with his own words. Did he forget that he was only in a virtual world? It appeared he had forgotten the fact. He immersed himself completely in his acting.</p> <p>“Washboard, I’ll show you what it means to be a man today!”</p> <p>When everyone else was retreating in horror, not only did Wang Baole refuse to retreat, he even roared and puckered his lips. He raised his chin as though his rotund face was as sharp as a blade. Filled with manliness, he strode forward and charged into the snake horde with indomitable might.</p> <p>The figure with extraordinary might and an imposing stance seemed to represent righteousness. He ran straight for the two girls!</p> <p>This scene immediately left Du Min dumbfounded. Even though she was amid the snakes, she still found the situation jarring. However, the adorable girl beside her could not help but become excited.</p> <p>As for the rest, they were astounded by Wang Baole’s roar and imposing might. At the instant the Red Bone White Neonate Snake approached the girls, Wang Baole arrived like a descending god. He grabbed the snake that struck horror into the hearts of many and threw it far away.</p> <p>He exuded a mighty and overbearing aura, as though a saint had possessed him that very instant. He emanated an awe-inspiring air, and without even hesitating, he carried the excited girl and stuffed the dazed Du Min under his armpit before rushing back toward the crowd.</p> <p>However, there were just too many snakes. On his journey back, he got bitten in the ass several times. His face was already black by the time he returned. However, he endured it by gritting his teeth. Only when he had safely brought the girls back did he lose his footing. Completely enervated, he collapsed.</p> <p><em>It seems I was a little foolhardy… My ass hurts. It’s proof that being a real man is very difficult,\\xa0</em>Wang Baole lamented inwardly. He saw Du Min still looking at him; she seemed to have fallen into a daze. As for the adorable girl, her eyes contained gratitude, as well as a peculiar look. The crowd around him looked at him as if they had seen a ghost. Although he found his eyelids heavy, he still felt a little proud of himself.</p> <p>When the painful wounds on his ass began to turn numb, Wang Baole immediately grabbed Du Min’s hand.</p> <p>“Du Min, I saved your life. I can’t feel my ass now. I heard that one can be saved if the venom is sucked out. Help me…” Without finishing his sentence, Wang Baole fainted. Just as his head toppled, he saw that he was about to fall on Du Min’s chest. He realized something and forcibly changed directions, landing on the adorable girl’s breasts.</p> <p>Upon seeing this scene, the crowd had odd looks on their faces. Du Min’s face turned grim when she saw how Wang Baole still had a repulsive look on his face despite being unconscious.</p> <p>At that moment, in the Federation’s dominion—a great distance away from the Pond Cloud Rainforest—a red cruiser was approaching Ethereal Dao College. Inside the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, hundreds of students were sleeping peacefully. Wang Baole was among them, too. He seemed to be having a beautiful dream—evident from the pleasant smile at the corner of his lips—as his head was cocked to the side.</p> <p>In the main hull of the cruiser, all the teachers, including the old physician, were staring blankly with widened eyes. They were looking at one of the crystal screens floating in front of them.</p> <p>The screen showed the unconscious Wang Baole, who had just saved Du Min in the Pond Cloud Rainforest.</p> <p>“What’s this fatty’s name?”</p> <p>“Although they are in a Hallucination Nexus, it feels no different from reality. His performance in there must stem from his true character!”</p> <p>“Such bravery and the fearlessness when it came to saving his schoolmates makes him a good seedling, one not seen in a hundred years! He’s the kind of excellent student that our Dao College yearns for the most!”</p> <p>The teachers exclaimed one after another as they marveled at Wang Baole. There were even a few teachers who were moved as they considered if they should rope in Wang Baole immediately to join their faculty.</p> <p>Even the old physician, also known as the Chancellor of Ethereal Dao College, was slightly dumbfounded. He hesitated, as he had a hunch that something was not right.</p> <p><em>Did I really make an error in my judgment?\\xa0</em>As he pondered over it, he took out Wang Baole’s file from the students’ dossier and began reading it.</p>']"

       "['[<p>On a scorching summer day, east of the Federation, fog emanated through Pond Cloud Rainforest like thin chiffon. Ancient towering trees interlocked each other, and birds would occasionally flit through the lush tree crowns, chirping as they flapped their wings and flew across the horizon.</p>, <p>High in the sky, the sun, which had seemed capable of existing eternally, no longer appeared anything like how people remembered. Instead, it had been penetrated by an ancient greenish-bronze sword—one so indescribably massive—many years ago! Only a small portion of the sword’s tip was exposed!</p>, <p>The ancient sword had come from the cosmos and seemed to express its antiquity. There was a potent suppressive force that formed a halo, which enveloped the firmament as though it held the land in place, letting all life revere it!</p>, <p>The Sword Sun and the rainforest looked picturesque from afar but was disturbed by a humming sound that came from a distance. A red hot-air balloon flew slowly toward the rainforest.</p>, <p>The hot-air balloon’s hull was very large, capable of holding hundreds of people. In there, many young men and women in groups of three or four chatted happily.</p>, <p>They were new students of Ethereal Dao College, one of the four great Dao Colleges in the Federation. They hailed from Phoenix City and were onboard Ethereal Dao College’s cruiser, traversing thousands of kilometers, to seek higher education.</p>, <p>Perhaps because they were all greatly anticipating their upcoming education—not to mention the unspoken attraction between men and women—the students had plenty of fun on the five-thousand-kilometer voyage.</p>, <p>Due to the long distance, the cruiser was equipped with dining halls, cultivation chambers, medical facilities, and many other amenities.</p>, <p>There were quite a number of students in the cruiser’s dining hall. Sitting at a table was a young fatty with his belly bulging out.</p>, <p>He was about seventeen years old, and he wore a blue baggy robe. His tiny rotund face could barely be considered to have intricate features. As he created smacking sounds while patting his belly, he gazed at the eight empty plates in front of him, a little regretful.</p>, <p><em>I’ll have gained another one and a half kilograms after this meal. Why didn’t I bear with it? I can’t die early if I want to become the Federation President.\\xa0</em>The fatty frowned with a grimace as he felt filled with regret, burping in the process.</p>, <p>The young fatty’s name was Wang Baole. He was also one of the students who had recently been accepted into Ethereal Dao College. His lifelong dream was to become an official, or more precisely, become the Federation President. The reason he had such an ambitious dream was intricately tied to a childhood experience of his.</p>, <p>In his memories, his father would frequently pat him on the head while speaking earnestly and sighing wistfully.</p>, <p>“Baole, being an official is the best. Remember, although money can solve everything, you can still be bullied by others. If you do not want to be bullied, the only way is to be an official, becoming a person who lords over the rest.”</p>, <p>Wang Baole did not understand his father’s words until he entered elementary school. One fateful day, he failed to hand in his homework on time and ended up being berated by the class monitor. Despite giving the class monitor two sweets, his name was still jotted down, and the class monitor snitched on him. All of this left a permanent mark in his young heart.</p>, <p>Hence, he wished to become the class monitor from that moment forth. It was not to bully others, but to ensure that he would not be bullied by others.</p>, <p>But as he grew up, he realized that many people bullied the class monitors. Therefore, he felt that only by becoming the highest official—the Federation President—could he ensure that no one would dare bully him. The reason he had racked his brains to enter Ethereal Dao College was because all the Federation’s high officials had graduated from the four great Dao Colleges.</p>, <p>However, he did not lead a blessed life. His family clan’s bloodline was quite an oddity. He even remembered that night one year ago when his father, who could be described as a bag of bones, had shown him the family tree.</p>, <p>It was the first time Wang Baole had seen it. He realized that all his ancestors had died early—before the age of thirty-five—if their body weight exceeded a hundred kilograms.</p>, <p>That night, Wang Baole had a dream… He had reunited with his fat forefathers before he successfully became the Federation President.</p>, <p>The matter of losing weight was elevated to something of great importance over the following year. The Spirit Inception Era meant rich Spirit Qi and a renewed interest in ancient martial arts; therefore, there were many weight-loss techniques. However, Wang Baole’s weight remained stable, despite the new era. He even experienced a slight rise in weight even after he attempted all of them.</p>, <p>As his memories surfaced, Wang Baole gritted his teeth, steeling his resolve to begin losing weight the next day.</p>, <p>Having made up his mind, Wang Baole immediately felt relieved. As he picked his teeth, he hummed a tune while looking at the distant blue sky outside the windows. His mind became active again.</p>, <p><em>I wonder if Physician Lu likes the gift I gave him. That is an antique I got from home. That old geezer will probably like it.\\xa0</em>Wang Baole comforted himself and guessed that if he managed to win Physician Lu’s favor, it would be equivalent to him having a tiny backer in the Dao College.</p>, <p><em>Teachers have limits to their authority, but I still have to give them some gifts in the future. Being so old, Physician Lu definitely has quite a wide social circle. I have likely taken the right step.\\xa0</em>Upon thinking of this, Wang Baole felt delighted. In his mind, he was one step closer to the position of the Federation President.</p>, <p>In regard to becoming the Federation President, he was very confident. This confidence stemmed from his research of the autobiographies of high officials, which he had gathered from a young age. He had even figured out a few trump cards needed in order to become a high official.</p>, <p>He was in a good mood as he looked at the blue skies outside the window, finding it especially beautiful.</p>, <p>But then, his eyes suddenly widened. He noticed that a black cloud was gathering in the distant sky. It spread out, covering the sky as lightning bolts flashed within it. The cloud slowly approached, and it also gained the attention of many as they exclaimed.</p>, <p>“It’s an electromagnetic pulse!”</p>, <p>Wang Baole was alarmed as well. After the Spirit Inception Era was ushered in, the appearance of Spirit Qi caused many stunning phenomena to arise in the world. Flying crafts from the past could no longer ensure safe travel. It resulted in the production of hot-air balloon cruisers propelled by Spirit Stones.</p>, <p>Amid constant exclamations, a rumbling thunder suddenly boomed. The black electromagnetic clouds burgeoned in size rapidly as the lightning within began spreading outward. Like a black net, it illuminated the horizons in a dazzling manner, causing the hearts of the spectators to race. Even the cruiser slowed down.</p>, <p>Just as people were feeling apprehensive, the door to the dining hall was pushed open. As though a cool wind had rushed in, a white-robed elder entered. His face was covered in wrinkles, but he had an ethereal air to him. His appearance exuded a feeling of propriety, especially his shimmering eyes, making him look like a person of righteousness. The moment he arrived, his domineering voice resounded throughout the dining hall.</p>, <p>“Everyone is to immediately report to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber. Wear your Magnetic Spirit attire, for we will be entering the electromagnetic domain in less than three minutes!”</p>, <p>The moment he spoke, all the students in the dining hall hurriedly stood up reverently.</p>, <p>Wang Baole’s eyes lit up. The elder in front of him was Physician Lu, the person he had previously gifted. From how he walked with flair, Wang Baole was increasingly convinced that his investment from before was right. He thought to himself that the old man was likely someone extraordinary, and he had really made the right move.</p>, <p>Just as he was reveling in his delight, the old physician swept his gaze across the room and saw Wang Baole. With a snort, he walked over, took out half a black mask, and threw it at him.</p>, <p>“Don’t waste your efforts on such inane acts when you are still so young. To think you have already learned the art of gifting before you’ve even entered the Dao College. I’m quite a learned person with experience. Keep the mask for yourself.” The old physician’s expression was solemn. He reprimanded Wang Baole with an honest and upright demeanor, as though he expected better from him.</p>, <p>Wang Baole received the mask as his heart skipped a beat. He turned somewhat worried, as he could tell that the old physician was angry. Just as he was about to give an explanation, he suddenly recalled one of the trump cards he had learned from the high officials’ autobiographies. One of them was that it was wise to thicken one’s skin to admit one’s mistakes in front of a superior. Typically, that would reduce a major issue to a minor one.</p>, <p>Therefore, he took a deep breath and hurriedly took on a contrite and penitent look to admit his fault.</p>, <p>“Teacher, you are right; I was at fault!”</p>, <p>The old physician turned a little intrigued. He could not deliver his planned tirade when the student had admitted his mistake so readily.</p>, <p>Wang Baole heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the old physician’s expression. He felt a little smug, thinking how useful the high officials’ autobiographies were.</p>, <p>The old physician snorted, raised his head, and scanned all the students in the dining hall. He raised his right hand and pointed at them.</p>, <p>“And all of you. All of you are future students of our Ethereal Dao College, but look at what you have been doing the past few days. You have to forever remember that, as warriors, we should first establish ourselves, watch our speech, and finally mind our conduct!”</p>, <p>The vice-abhorring physician’s words resounded through the dining hall. Everyone who heard it could not help but lower their heads in shame. As for Wang Baole, his eyes immediately lit up. He felt it was the appropriate moment for him to shine.</p>, <p>He quickly took out a tiny notebook and began writing on it. From time to time, he would raise his head to look at the old physician with a diligent and attentive look on his face. At times, he would even nod seriously as though he was trying to remember every single word. Obviously, this was also from the teachings in the high officials’ autobiographies.</p>, <p>When his other classmates saw this, they looked at Wang Baole as though they were looking at a man of God.</p>, <p>The old physician momentarily fell into a daze when he saw this. An unprecedented sense of oddness arose in his heart. This was the first time he had encountered such an oddity after enrolling so many batches of students. He could not help but take a few looks at him before he slowly sneered.</p>, <p>“Little fellow, it’s not that easy to suck up to me. You ought to thank the electromagnetic pulse. If not for that, I would have reprimanded you for three days and three nights. I would be rather interested to see if you can write all of that in your tiny notebook!”</p>, <p>The moment he said those words, the mood immediately changed. The aura of an expert emanated from his body as it seemed to manifest as a suppressive force that blanketed the entire dining hall. Every student became alarmed. They all felt that the old physician clearly had the upper hand in the battle of wits.</p>, <p>Wang Baole blinked as he touched the recording jade slip in his pocket. After weighing the situation and noticing how they were approaching the electromagnetic pulse steadily, he gave up the thought of taking it out. He felt that backing down in front of a superior was nothing embarrassing.</p>, <p>The old physician became delighted when he saw the expressions on everyone. He generously threw them a few more words of motivation.</p>, <p>“Remember, put all your effort into cultivating. In the future, you must not be greedy or deceitful. Don’t even think about finding girlfriends. I have to make it known to you that lust and danger are just two sides of the same coin! The way all of you have been acting for the past few days has been preposterous!”</p>, <p>Just as he said that, a sweet voice suddenly sounded from the old physician’s voice transmission bangle.</p>, <p>“Grandpa Physician, where are you? Where do the Magnetic Spirit clothes go on? What should it cover? Quick, come and help me.”</p>, <p>The charming voice made the old physician tremble involuntarily. He barely forced a dry cough as he stared sternly at everyone. Only then did he turn around in a rush, and at the same time, he spoke excitedly into the voice transmission bangle. “Oh, I’m coming. Baby, don’t fret. I’m coming to help you right now.”</p>, <p>The turn of events had simply happened too quickly, and the contrast was striking. Everyone was dumbfounded, and even Wang Baole was taken aback. He drew a deep breath moments later. Following that, there was an uproar as Wang Baole clenched his teeth and cursed.</p>, <p><em>Shameless! What that old pervert said was utter bullshit! There are only so many female schoolmates. There aren’t enough for all of us, but he is actually trying to snatch resources from us at his age. Isn’t it all because he’s some kind of official?</em></p>, <p>Wang Baole became more infuriated the more he thought about the matter. He joined in the conversations with the classmates around him. It only strengthened his determination to become an official.</p>, <p>Another alarm sounded, ending everyone’s conversations. All of them immediately rushed to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber.</p>, <p>The Spirit Cultivation Chamber was located in the core region of the cruiser, and like its name, it was a place for students to cultivate. At the same time, it was the place where the most security was deployed whenever the cruiser crossed any special zones.</p>, <p>As people gathered in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, they were made to sit in rows under the direction of the Ethereal Dao College teachers. They were dressed in the Magnetic Spirit clothes that Ethereal Dao College had handed out.</p>, <p>Wang Baole was still dwelling on his anger toward Physician Lu even after he changed into the Magnetic Spirit clothes. He casually looked up and surveyed his surroundings. His depression immediately turned for the worse when he spotted a certain someone. He could not help but furrow his brows as he gave a look of disparagement.</p>, <p>Sitting where his sight had landed was a girl with long, slender legs. She looked charming, but she had her brows knitted and a look of disgust, too. Clearly, they were very familiar with each other but also hated each other from the looks they were giving one another.</p>, <p><em>What bad luck!</em></p>, <p>Both of them grumbled inwardly as they looked away. It was as though just a glance of each other was a sore sight.</p>, <p>“I see that flat-chested Du Min, everywhere I go. How irritating!” Wang Baole muttered under his breath. He had been classmates with the girl, Du Min, ever since he began schooling. She was usually proud and aloof, and she constantly made things difficult for him as her role as class monitor. She also happened to be the receiver of the two sweets he had given back then.</p>, <p>“What’s so impressive about her? Isn’t she just some lame class monitor? When we arrive at the Dao Colleges, I’ll use the teachings of the officials and get some kind of official role!” snorted Wang Baole.</p>, <p>Soon, everyone had changed their clothing. The teachers in the Ethereal Dao College cruiser checked everyone’s attire and explained certain important matters. They also warned everyone that things could become dangerous once the cruiser entered the electromagnetic domain. The risk of death was not negligible.</p>, <p>After everyone’s expression changed, the teachers left solemnly. The door to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber was sealed as the lights dimmed.</p>, <p>Although there were murmurs in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, the nervousness people felt turned more intense over the passage of time. Gradually, no one spoke as the chamber fell into silence.</p>, <p>It got so quiet that they could hear their own heartbeats. Even Wang Baole, who still felt disgruntled, turned nervous. As the remaining minutes counted down, the entire cruiser suddenly shook, signifying its entry into the electromagnetic domain!</p>, <p>Outside, the black electromagnetic clouds looked extremely grand. It resembled a huge mouth that seemed to devour the tiny hot-air balloon cruiser.</p>, <p>This phenomenon contained a destructive might that could sweep away everything. Perhaps only the stunning Sword Sun above the heavens could ignore such destruction, as though it could weather that turmoil and anything else thrown at it for millennia to come.</p>, <p>This year was the 37th year of the Spirit Inception Era.</p>, <p>In A.D. 3029, Earth’s technology progressed rapidly, and the world was united with no national borders. It entered a federation era, and it was during this period that the massive sword flew from the cosmos and penetrated the sun, sending shockwaves across the world.</p>, <p>The hilt of the sword might have been damaged from the beginning, but the powerful impact shattered it into numerous fragments, which scattered across space, with portions of it landing all over the Earth.</p>, <p>Accompanying the arrival of the greenish-bronze sword and the falling of the fragments, the Earth suddenly had a perpetual new source of energy that permeated everywhere. It was later named… Spirit Qi!</p>, <p>Spirit Qi was like air. Some places were denser and others thinner. The Federation and other factions obtained the scattered fragments, and through them, found the relevant information needed for cultivation training and cultivation artifacts, pill refinement, and Spirit Stone refinement. The text on the fragments looked ancient, which made people’s interest in ancient texts become mainstream.</p>, <p>The appearance of Spirit Qi quickly eliminated the need for all existing resources. It changed the lives of people and formed the Spirit Internet. It also changed the progress of Earth’s civilization. It initiated a cultivation civilization all over Earth.</p>, <p>From then on, ancient martial arts became popular as a revolutionary change happened throughout the world. Thus, the era of immortal cultivation began.</p>, <p>History called it the Spirit Inception Era.</p>, <p>In the black electromagnetic cloud, the red hot-air balloon cruiser slowly proceeded forward. Lightning flashed continuously as bolt after bolt struck the cruiser incessantly. Thankfully, there was a soft halo surrounding the cruiser, allowing it to fly stably.</p>, <p>As for the Spirit Cultivation Chamber in the cruiser’s core, all the students, including Wang Baole, were in there. They had unknowingly fallen asleep as though there was a strange power that pulled them into a dream.</p>, <p>At the cruiser’s helm were eight teachers. Some of them were drinking tea while others were smiling. They were having light-hearted conversations, looking completely different from when they frightened their students.</p>, <p>Their leader was an elder with a face covered in wrinkles. He held a smoke pipe as he sucked on it. If Wang Baole was here, he would definitely have recognized him as the shameless Physician Lu.</p>, <p>The old physician smiled faintly when a middle-aged teacher asked, “Chancellor, everything is in order. Shall we begin the trial for this student cohort?”</p>, <p>“Begin!”</p>]',\n",
       " '[<p>The bright moon illuminated the nearly starless evening sky.</p>, <p>It was still the same Pond Cloud Rainforest, but there was an additional chilly air to the night. Occasionally, one would see rivers formed from the accumulation of rainwater, which appeared charming under the moonlight. However, the cries of beasts or birds easily left one feeling uneasy.</p>, <p>In a corner of the Pond Cloud Rainforest beside a river, there were two girls who looked a little wretched, but still innocent. One of them was tall, and the other looked adorable, each possessing a unique charm. The tall girl was watching her surroundings nervously while the adorable girl took off her undergarments, revealing her snow-white skin. She winced as she massaged the wound around her armpit. She had a chaotic look in her eyes as she muttered softly, “Du Min, it has been three days. Who knows when rescue will come? Our camp is quickly running out of food.”</p>, <p>The tall girl, Du Min, fell silent when she heard that. She felt her life had changed completely over the past three days. She had been a student of Ethereal Dao College three days ago, but now, she was lost in a land filled with danger.</p>, <p>The Pond Cloud Rainforest looked beautiful, but in fact, its ground was moist and filled with decay. Animal bones could be seen from time to time, and there were many foot-long centipedes and colorful snakes making their occasional appearances. The sight left one’s scalp tingling.</p>, <p>Animals had also evolved rapidly, like humans, ever since the Spirit Inception Era. They had great strength and were extremely savage. It made the wilderness a forbidden zone for humans.</p>, <p>As the two girls agonized over their predicament, a fatty who had an unyielding look on his face stood not far from them under a tree. With his head up, he stood there peeing.</p>, <p>The fatty was none other than Wang Baole. He had not noticed the two girls, nor did he see the tiny flowers beneath his feet. They had originally stood tall and proud, but now, the flowers were swaying wildly because of the stream of pee.</p>, <p><em>Darn it. I, Wang Baole, have always claimed to be able to read people, seeing through the hearts of all. I never expected that I would fall for Ethereal Dao College’s scheme!</em></p>, <p><em>This Ethereal Dao College is way too wicked. They managed to put on such a realistic act. To convince us of the situation, they even made everyone see the cruiser explode!</em></p>, <p>Wang Baole was infuriated deep down. The past three days had truly put him on tenterhooks.</p>, <p>Three days ago, he and his schoolmates had fallen asleep in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber without even realizing it. They were awoken by a loud bang and before they could even get their bearings, their bodies were thrown right out of the cruiser by a powerful impact.</p>, <p>Thankfully, the Magnetic Spirit attire had the ability to reduce shock and repel lightning. He had landed in the Pond Cloud Rainforest safely but had then witnessed the cruiser explode amid the electromagnetic pulse.</p>, <p>Wang Baole and the others found themselves scattered across the forest. There was a lack of food, and the beasts were ferocious. Their future was still a question mark, and the horror the students faced made them change drastically. Some revealed their true characters. Others formed groups, and a few forged ahead alone. Some were decisive, and some were weak.</p>, <p>The concept of survival of the fittest was just too jarring and sudden for these students who had just been enrolled into Ethereal Dao College. But under such a drastic change, it seemed to trigger certain things in them. Be it greed or ferocity, selflessness or kindness, all of them sprouted and were magnified.</p>, <p>“Shameless!” Wang Baole grumbled deep down. He had believed everything he encountered the past three days to be real. He had been so frightened that he had put up with the thought of staying in the camp of his archrival, Du Min, when he bumped into her.</p>, <p>After three days passed, he realized that by not eating proper meals, he had miraculously lost about three kilograms through his voice transmission ring’s weight-measuring feature. His shock from the revelation turned into suspicion.</p>, <p>This was just too different from the experience Wang Baole had in the past. He had once fasted and worked out crazily for a month in order to lose weight, but for an unknown reason, not only did he not lose weight, he even gained one and a half kilograms!</p>, <p>Now, he had lost about three kilograms in three days. That was completely impossible for him!</p>, <p>Especially when he recalled the autobiographies he had read. In them, people reminisced on their days in their respective Dao Colleges and seemed to mention, in vague terms, that the Dao Colleges would have so-called freshman tests from time to time.</p>, <p>If not for Wang Baole’s thorough research, it would have been very difficult for him to have noticed this point. Having connected the dots together, he was baffled by how everything that had happened was done so realistically by Ethereal Dao College. It was very likely that there had only been a slip up because they had designed the experience based on an ordinary person. But clearly, he was no ordinary person.</p>, <p>He was fifty percent certain that everything he saw in front of him was an illusion.</p>, <p>And the evidence that fully convinced him of his theory was… the black half-mask that the old physician had returned to him!</p>, <p>With this thought in mind, the peeing Wang Baole could not help but lower his head to look at his chest. An indescribable sense of peculiarity arose in his heart.</p>, <p>He acutely remembered that he had casually kept the black half-mask close to his chest before he stepped into the Spirit Cultivation Chamber. After the terrifying turn of events, he’d had no time to even think about it. It was only moments ago that he realized by sheer chance that his hand could pass through the mask, despite it looking normal. It was as though he could not touch the mask.</p>, <p>It seemed like the virtual world, which could replicate almost anything, found it difficult to decompose the mask’s components to model it.</p>, <p>And with the passage of time, even its external shape had begun to turn unreal. At the same time, it exuded some blurry fragments of text.</p>, <p>Although he could not read it clearly, the changes in the mask made Wang Baole’s confidence in his theory go from fifty percent to a hundred percent!</p>, <p>If he continued analyzing according to his theory, it was not hard to guess the goal of the test with the fake catastrophe as its backstory.</p>, <p><em>It’s impossible for it to be a measure of strength. After all, everyone has yet to study any ancient martial arts. Then, the goal of this test must be to test one’s mettle in the face of danger. Perhaps it’s also to test one’s confidence in the Dao College?</em></p>, <p>As Wang Baole peed, his mind whirled constantly. From time to time, he would even have a few pee shivers.</p>, <p>As the tiny flower in front of him was getting pelted into a mess, Wang Baole’s breathing hastened a little. He felt that he had to grasp the opportunity in front of him to gain bonus points.</p>, <p><em>That’s what I’ll do!\\xa0</em>Upon coming to this conclusion, Wang Baole shook himself vigorously, and just as he was about to pull up his pants, he suddenly saw the tiny river not far away.</p>, <p>Under the moonlight, although Du Min was standing there, Wang Baole’s eyes were not on her. They were fixated on the adorable girl who was cleaning her wound.</p>, <p><em>There’s a humanoid beast!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole’s eyes widened as he gasped. His heart raced when he</p>, <p>caught sight of them. Du Min, who remained vigilant of her surroundings, sensed the gaze. She looked over, and her eyes met Wang Baole’s. After a moment of shock, her expression changed, but before she could scream, Wang Baole glared at her, pulled up his pants, and shouted first.</p>, <p>“What are you looking at? Have you never seen a man pee?”</p>, <p>The moment he said that, Du Min choked from all the things that she wanted to say. She trembled in rage, for she had never met another man as shameless as Wang Baole. She could not help but curse.</p>, <p>“Darn Fatty, you call yourself a man?”</p>, <p>Wang Baole nearly swelled in anger when he heard that. The snarky Du Min had been his archrival since he was young. They felt repulsed by the sight of each other, and in a twist of fate, they had always been in the same class. Now, they had both enrolled in Ethereal Dao College. Wang Baole took a deep breath and scoffed.</p>, <p>“Darn Washboard, you call yourself a woman?”</p>, <p>Du Min nearly spat out a mouthful of blood when she heard the biting remark. A vein protruded from her forehead, and just as she was about to charge over, Wang Baole let out a long sigh.</p>, <p>“My untainted body has been completely seen by the two of you. How can I live on?” He looked as though life held nothing more for him as he pulled up his pants and ran off. His heart was racing while cold sweat covered his back. He complimented himself for being quick to react, or else he would have been in trouble.</p>, <p>Du Min widened her eyes angrily when she saw Wang Baole escaping. In response, she chased after him. As for the adorable girl in the river behind her, she had a bewildered look after hearing the duo’s biting exchange. She did not feel like Wang Baole had sexually harassed her. When she saw Du Min run off in pursuit, she donned her clothes and quickly chased after the duo with her face red.</p>, <p>Du Min’s angry tirade broke the Pond Cloud Rainforest’s silence. People from the temporary encampment up ahead rushed over when they heard the disturbance, blocking Wang Baole from proceeding further.</p>, <p>The person leading the group was a torch-wielding youth dressed in white. He had a burly build with eyebrows like swords and eyes like stars. He stood out from the crowd with many students surrounding him. Clearly, he was the leader.</p>, <p>This person was Liu Daobin, the person who had united everyone in this encampment over the past three days, showcasing his personal charm.</p>, <p>“Wang Baole, what did you do!” Liu Daobin noticed Du Min rushing over furiously at a glance. And Wang Baole, who was being pursued, was holding up his pants as he proceeded forward. Liu Daobin had been taken aback by such an odd scene. He had long taken a liking to Du Min, so he instinctively loathed Wang Baole.</p>, <p>“All I did was pee…” Before Wang Baole could finish his sentence, they heard a loud scream coming from the two girls far away.</p>, <p>A stench instantly permeated the area as soon as they heard the scream. Swashing sounds like waves crashing into the beach spread quickly like a storm passing through.</p>, <p>Wang Baole jerked his head around, and at the same time, the expressions of Liu Daobin and the other students changed. They saw countless snakes slithering out from the ground and tree branches around Du Min and the adorable girl!</p>, <p>The snakes looked extremely venomous, judging from the myriad of colors they could see. The numbers were just too great, and it looked like a sea of snakes was surrounding the two girls.</p>, <p>The duo had a drastic change in expression when they saw the snakes surround them. It was even worse when the snakes opened their mouths lined with venomous fangs. Venomous liquid dripped down as they hissed. The stench was revolting.</p>, <p>Liu Daobin jolted. He did not have the time to bother with Wang Baole. He charged straight for Du Min. There were a few other students who ran over to help with reddened eyes.</p>, <p>All of this happened too quickly. At the instant everyone rushed over to help, there was an infantile cry coming from the distant forest. It left one’s heart palpitating. A red line, which was as thick as a human’s arm, could be seen clearly despite the darkness. It flitted over at an astounding speed.</p>, <p>The body that leaped occasionally revealed a pale white head. It no longer looked like a snake’s head; it resembled that of a baby. However, the look in its eyes made everyone’s heart thump heavily.</p>, <p>“Red Bone White Neonate Snake!” One of the students recognized it. Everyone panicked, and people retreated amid shocked exclamations.</p>, <p>Liu Daobin became flustered as his hair stood on end. He felt his heart palpitating furiously. The Red Bone White Neonate Snake was simply too infamous. It was listed as one of the top thousand dangerous creatures in the Spirit Inception Era. Although its body was weak, it was very fast, and its venom was potent. Just being tainted by a sliver of its venom was enough to reduce one to a pool of blood, leaving the victim with only red bones. That was also how it had earned its name.</p>, <p>Even though he liked Du Min, he instinctively felt that she was not worth losing his life for. He subconsciously took a step back to avoid the Red Bone White Neonate Snake, afraid that he and the rest would perish while it reveled in its murderous deeds.</p>, <p>Wang Baole took a deep breath when he saw this scene. Following that, he immediately recalled that everything was, in fact, fake. He immediately relaxed as his eyes lit up. He knew his opportunity to shine in front of the teachers had appeared.</p>, <p><em>Since it’s all fake, what’s there to be afraid of?\\xa0</em>Upon coming to this conclusion, Wang Baole immediately puffed out his chest and looked at his schoolmates, who were running away contemptibly.</p>, <p>“Although the flat-chested Du Min, has a biting tongue and is ugly, and she is her always using her privileges to make things difficult for me, I, Wang Baole, am a person of sublime character, a righteous person, a man not afraid of sacrifice, a person who has transcended mediocrity, and someone who is willing to help his schoolmates!</p>, <p>“In such a dangerous environment, how can I retreat? Others might be afraid to forge forward for fear of death, but… for my schoolmates, I have no fear!”</p>, <p>The shameless fatty nearly moved himself with his own words. Did he forget that he was only in a virtual world? It appeared he had forgotten the fact. He immersed himself completely in his acting.</p>, <p>“Washboard, I’ll show you what it means to be a man today!”</p>, <p>When everyone else was retreating in horror, not only did Wang Baole refuse to retreat, he even roared and puckered his lips. He raised his chin as though his rotund face was as sharp as a blade. Filled with manliness, he strode forward and charged into the snake horde with indomitable might.</p>, <p>The figure with extraordinary might and an imposing stance seemed to represent righteousness. He ran straight for the two girls!</p>, <p>This scene immediately left Du Min dumbfounded. Even though she was amid the snakes, she still found the situation jarring. However, the adorable girl beside her could not help but become excited.</p>, <p>As for the rest, they were astounded by Wang Baole’s roar and imposing might. At the instant the Red Bone White Neonate Snake approached the girls, Wang Baole arrived like a descending god. He grabbed the snake that struck horror into the hearts of many and threw it far away.</p>, <p>He exuded a mighty and overbearing aura, as though a saint had possessed him that very instant. He emanated an awe-inspiring air, and without even hesitating, he carried the excited girl and stuffed the dazed Du Min under his armpit before rushing back toward the crowd.</p>, <p>However, there were just too many snakes. On his journey back, he got bitten in the ass several times. His face was already black by the time he returned. However, he endured it by gritting his teeth. Only when he had safely brought the girls back did he lose his footing. Completely enervated, he collapsed.</p>, <p><em>It seems I was a little foolhardy… My ass hurts. It’s proof that being a real man is very difficult,\\xa0</em>Wang Baole lamented inwardly. He saw Du Min still looking at him; she seemed to have fallen into a daze. As for the adorable girl, her eyes contained gratitude, as well as a peculiar look. The crowd around him looked at him as if they had seen a ghost. Although he found his eyelids heavy, he still felt a little proud of himself.</p>, <p>When the painful wounds on his ass began to turn numb, Wang Baole immediately grabbed Du Min’s hand.</p>, <p>“Du Min, I saved your life. I can’t feel my ass now. I heard that one can be saved if the venom is sucked out. Help me…” Without finishing his sentence, Wang Baole fainted. Just as his head toppled, he saw that he was about to fall on Du Min’s chest. He realized something and forcibly changed directions, landing on the adorable girl’s breasts.</p>, <p>Upon seeing this scene, the crowd had odd looks on their faces. Du Min’s face turned grim when she saw how Wang Baole still had a repulsive look on his face despite being unconscious.</p>, <p>At that moment, in the Federation’s dominion—a great distance away from the Pond Cloud Rainforest—a red cruiser was approaching Ethereal Dao College. Inside the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, hundreds of students were sleeping peacefully. Wang Baole was among them, too. He seemed to be having a beautiful dream—evident from the pleasant smile at the corner of his lips—as his head was cocked to the side.</p>, <p>In the main hull of the cruiser, all the teachers, including the old physician, were staring blankly with widened eyes. They were looking at one of the crystal screens floating in front of them.</p>, <p>The screen showed the unconscious Wang Baole, who had just saved Du Min in the Pond Cloud Rainforest.</p>, <p>“What’s this fatty’s name?”</p>, <p>“Although they are in a Hallucination Nexus, it feels no different from reality. His performance in there must stem from his true character!”</p>, <p>“Such bravery and the fearlessness when it came to saving his schoolmates makes him a good seedling, one not seen in a hundred years! He’s the kind of excellent student that our Dao College yearns for the most!”</p>, <p>The teachers exclaimed one after another as they marveled at Wang Baole. There were even a few teachers who were moved as they considered if they should rope in Wang Baole immediately to join their faculty.</p>, <p>Even the old physician, also known as the Chancellor of Ethereal Dao College, was slightly dumbfounded. He hesitated, as he had a hunch that something was not right.</p>, <p><em>Did I really make an error in my judgment?\\xa0</em>As he pondered over it, he took out Wang Baole’s file from the students’ dossier and began reading it.</p>]',\n",
       " '[<p>Wang Baole still found himself inside the Hallucination Nexus when he woke up. A day had passed, and the snakes’ venom was not as potent as people imagined. Thanks to the schoolmates who were skilled in the treatment of snake venom, Wang Baole failed to have his beautiful wish fulfilled.</p>, <p>Thankfully, when he regained consciousness, Bunny, whose real name was Zhou Xiaoya, took care of him meticulously. For once, Du Min did not clash with him. This made Wang Baole feel at ease. He began recalling the rescue he had accomplished. The teachers must have seen it, and he must have gained quite a number of bonus points from the test.</p>, <p>The only thing that left him depressed was that while the group traversed the forest in search of their schoolmates over the following days, Liu Daobin seemed like a completely different person. Perhaps because he was feeling ashamed of what had happened, he would consistently choose to charge straight ahead to quickly resolve any problems whenever they encountered any danger along the way. It robbed the already frail Wang Baole of opportunities to showcase himself.</p>, <p>And worst of all, there were no more serious situations like the horde of snakes. It made Wang Baole feel like he was wasting the potential of his talents. While wallowing in depression, all he could do was watch Liu Daobin gain more points for the test.</p>, <p><em>If Liu Daobin continues like this, his score in this secret test might even be higher than mine!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole eventually turned anxious, but these emotions did not last too long. They had set up camp in a narrow passage between huge rocks, also known as a One-Line Sky, and late into the second night, they heard the ferocious howling of wolves.</p>, <p>The howls seemed able to penetrate rock, piercing straight into the ears of all present. People awoke shocked as they looked over. They immediately saw numerous pairs of blood-red eyes amid the boundless woods in front of them.</p>, <p>There were countless savage wolves, which had surrounded them in a fan-shaped formation. Some were running on the ground while others had leaped into the trees. They let out snarling howls with eyes filled with bloodlust. It was a shocking sight!</p>, <p>This scene seemed to form a repressive wind that changed the expressions of Liu Daobin and company. They were covered in sweat as their scalps turned numb.</p>, <p>“Quick, run! There’s a pack of wolves!”</p>, <p>“They are Nether Bone Wolves!”</p>, <p>After the encounter with the snake horde, Du Min appeared to have matured a lot more. She immediately shouted for everyone to enter the One-Line Sky and use the geological formation to ward off the pack of wolves.</p>, <p>Liu Daobin appeared ambivalent before he finally gritted his teeth. He did not immediately retreat when facing the pack of wolves. Instead, he called upon his schoolmates to fend off the wolves to stall for time.</p>, <p>Bunny helped Wang Baole up in a fluster. Although she trembled, she still managed to drag him toward the One-Line Sky with everyone else. However, Wang Baole was already filled with anxiety at that moment.</p>, <p>From his point of view, it was fine if he had yielded a few points to Liu Daobin before. Now that a huge opportunity had presented itself, how could he allow Liu Daobin to snatch it away? Instantly, a sacred fire seemed to blaze in his eyes. He regained his might once again as he stopped in his tracks.</p>, <p>“Xiaoya, leave first!”</p>, <p>After Wang Baole said that, he ran straight for where Liu Daobin was. He grabbed him, and while Liu Daobin was shocked, Wang Baole threw him toward the One-Line Sky, while shouting loudly, “Brother, retreat first. I’m here!”</p>, <p>Liu Daobin was completely confounded. Before he could react, he saw Wang Baole charge into the pack of wolves without any hesitation.</p>, <p>“Everyone, leave quickly. I’ll protect you!” At that moment, Wang Baole exuded righteousness and sacredness once more. A distance away, Bunny felt her heartstrings tremble once again as she looked at Wang Baole.</p>, <p>There were other male schoolmates who had already retreated back to the One-Line Sky. But stirred on by Wang Baole, they felt ardor and zeal course through their bodies. They turned around, and as they were about to follow in his footsteps, a red-eyed Wang Baole kicked all of them back.</p>, <p>Wang Baole had an awe-inspiring righteousness about him as he roared, “Brothers, leave first!”</p>, <p>He was very alert, afraid that others would vie with him for points!</p>, <p>From his point of view, the pack of wolves was still worth points even if they looked savage.</p>, <p>As for the students who had been kicked back to the One-Line Sky, they felt palpitations through them while their eyes filled with gratitude. They could not help but feel pumped when they saw Wang Baole’s selfless figure, his might, and his cause that was greater than himself. They attempted to charge forward once again.</p>, <p>Wang Baole instantly turned anxious as he rushed to push each and every one of them back. He was afraid that they would come back again, so he gritted his teeth and raised his hands up by the One-Line Sky’s entrance and pressed down on the rock walls, using his body as a meat shield.</p>, <p>He anxiously roared, “I’ve already been poisoned by the snakes. There’s no way for me to escape. Don’t worry about me. Leave quickly, all of you!”</p>, <p>Wang Baole’s every word was dripping with raw emotion. It left the people rushing forward quivering, and at that moment, the pack of wolves sped up. They swarmed over and snarled, their bloodlust being felt thoroughly. They pounced at Wang Baole crazily.</p>, <p>This scene shook the students, who had retreated into the One-Line Sky, to their very core.</p>, <p>“Wang Baole, come back quickly!”</p>, <p>“Heavens, he’s using his flesh and blood to block the pack of wolves to not be a burden on us!” Bunny, Du Min, and all the other students in the One-Line Sky were moved by his gesture. They only felt that the present Wang Baole and his rotund figure appeared like a majestic mountain, a picture that would be engraved in their memories for all eternity.</p>, <p>Liu Daobin was similarly moved. His breathing hastened, and his displeasure toward Wang Baole completely dissipated. All that was left was a deep sense of shock.</p>, <p>The scene of Wang Baole holding up his arms to the walls like a human blockade felt like he was holding up the collapsing sky!</p>, <p>Even Wang Baole was moved by his own actions. He felt that if he were a teacher, he would definitely be deeply moved after seeing all that he had done. But in order to gain more points, he secretly thought of sucking up to the college. He said firmly, “It is my honor to have been accepted by Ethereal Dao College even if I die here. I live and die as part of Ethereal Dao College!”</p>, <p>Wang Baole felt pleased, completely satisfied with his own words. He did not believe that the teachers would not be moved by his words and actions!</p>, <p>However, this sense of complacency did not last long. Wang Baole, who had only considered gaining more points in the test, had forgotten one thing. That was… he could feel pain!</p>, <p>Although he was hallucinating, the pain was no different from that of real life. As the howling wolves approached and clamped their jaws on him, he instantly seemed to drown amid the dozen or so wolves right in front of everyone.</p>, <p><em>It hurts!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole’s body quivered as his breathing turned heavy. All he could see were the jaws of the wolves, and he smelled the blood on them. The excruciating pain that ensued when their fangs bit at his flesh made him nearly forget that it was all an illusion.</p>, <p>But he was determined and had no intention to retreat!</p>, <p>His body turned into a bloody mess, exposing white bone in many spots. All he could hear was the shredding sounds and wolf howls mixed together like a death knell as his consciousness became haze. But despite such excruciating pain, he displayed the one outstanding quality he possessed amid all his flaws.</p>, <p>That was… grit!</p>, <p><em>It was not easy to encounter a situation worth so many points. I can’t waste it. I want to score past the maximum in this test by getting all the bonus points in one go!</em>Wang Baole roared inwardly. Just as he wanted to hold on a little longer, a red-figure suddenly dashed past the weeping and retreating students from a distance away at a stunning speed!</p>, <p>The red-figure was a short-haired youth who looked about eighteen. He was handsome, and there was a coldness in his eyes and brows. He wore a red attire that only made it easier for him to do combat. He had a huge bow slung over his shoulder, and his body was like a flitting ape in the woods. As he approached, he drew his bow and released an unexpected barrage of arrows.</p>, <p>Nine arrows shot out instantly!</p>, <p>The arrows were just too fast as they whistled through the air and past the crowd. They whizzed through the One-Line Sky and whistled over Wang Baole’s head, beneath his crouch, and past his limbs. Nine ferocious wolves were struck as they let out sharp painful cries!</p>, <p>Not a single shot missed its target. The immense strength contained within sent the nine wolves flying upon impact!</p>, <p>This sudden turn of events made all the retreating students fall into a daze. Even Wang Baole was taken aback. The nine arrows had flown past him in such close proximity that he had been given quite a fright.</p>, <p>Before he could even react, the red-dressed youth moved even faster under the watchful eyes of everyone. As though his strength had suddenly surged, he followed closely behind the arrows and charged through the One-Line Sky, leaped above Wang Baole’s head, and shot another nine arrows!</p>, <p>With a few alarming thuds, which were accompanied by the tragic cries of nine wolves, the surrounding wolves were terrified. They instinctively retreated, and the red-dressed youth used this opportunity to land, grab Wang Baole, and retreat rapidly.</p>, <p>Wang Baole’s body jolted. He did not care about the pain; he was anxiously watching as the gap between him and the wolves widened.</p>, <p>“Brother, put me down. I can still last a little longer!”</p>, <p>The red-dressed youth was moved by Wang Baole’s words, even though he was quite an aloof person. Wang Baole’s body was mangled, as though it would crumble at any moment.</p>, <p>“You have already done very well. Leave the rest to me!”</p>, <p>Wang Baole turned more agitated when he heard that. He felt like the youth was taking his lines for himself. Just as he was about to say another word, the youth took a deep breath. He raised his right hand suddenly as the muscles on his arm instantly swelled several notches. Wang Baole saw the startling sight of him drawing the huge bow in his hand, aiming at the rock wall to the side. Very quickly, more than ten shots had been delivered.</p>, <p>The strength used was just too great. Cracks appeared in the rocks, and the wall collapsed, crumbling into countless fragmentary stones. With a rumble, the One-Line Sky was completely blocked.</p>, <p>Wang Baole widened his eyes as he looked at the youth’s beefy arm and swallowed the words that he had been about to say.</p>, <p>Everything had happened too quickly. As the One-Line Sky collapsed, the red-dressed youth blinked and carried Wang Baole back to the crowd.</p>, <p>The students not far away felt their minds and hearts quake when they saw this scene. Liu Daobin drew a gasp and opened his mouth, but no voice came out of it.</p>, <p>“The Ancient Martial realm’s second level, Physical Seal!”</p>, <p>“I haven’t reached Physical Seal yet. I have only perfected my first level,” the red-dressed youth explained as he gave Liu Daobin a glance and lowered Wang Baole.</p>, <p>“You already have the might of a Physical Seal even without attaining it. Thank you for saving us!” Liu Daobin quickly cupped his fist to salute him. The other schoolmates rushed to do the same. There were even quite a number of girls who looked at him with reverence. Instantly, the red-dressed youth was the center of attention.</p>, <p>As for Wang Baole, he was lying on the ground, watching all of this in depression. He knew that the red-dressed youth had saved him out of good will, but he felt that he had lost his opportunity to win points. However, he knew that there was nothing he could do about that.</p>, <p><em>The Ancient Martial realm…\\xa0</em>Wang Baole sighed inwardly. Ever since the Federation entered the Spirit Inception Era, most citizens had only been able to learn a beginning cultivation technique known as Qi Fostering Art despite it being an era of cultivation.</p>, <p>The technique allowed one to absorb Spirit Qi to extend one’s longevity and use one’s body as a medium to condense Spirit Stones for sale. That was why it was spread widely.</p>, <p>For actual cultivation, the barriers of entry remained very high, and it was difficult to meet the requirements. It also needed a foundation, which was why ancient martial arts had experienced a resurgence.</p>, <p>After the Federation concluded various studies, the three levels of the Ancient Martial realm were formed!</p>, <p>Blood Qi, Physical Seal, Pulse Enrichment!</p>, <p>Only by reaching the perfected stage of the Pulse Enrichment level would one be qualified to vie for the fate of the Dao that was equivalent to a golden opportunity!</p>, <p>However, most of the Ancient Martial realm cultivation techniques were in the hands of the various factions of the Federation. The most orthodox method of obtaining them, for most people, was to be accepted into one of the four Dao Colleges. Apart from that, they could only obtain them by offering their services to various large factions or families.</p>, <p><em>He’s about my age. He’s likely from a renowned family.\\xa0</em>Wang Baole sighed. The feeling of having his limelight stolen only made the excruciating pain burn more intensely. He could not help but grunt painfully to attract the attention of everyone. Many people rushed over immediately.</p>, <p>Wang Baole felt a lot better when he realized that people still valued him. However, he found it too painful, and now that his score was likely enough, he decided to simply pass away. Hence, he took a deep breath and spoke in a trembling voice.</p>, <p>“I can’t hold on much longer. Schoolmates, after you become students of my Ethereal Dao College, you must…” Wang Baole had fully gotten into character with his emotions. He was about to deliver his words filled with roused magnanimity.</p>, <p>But at that moment, the red-dressed youth had a solemn expression. He walked to Wang Baole’s side, took out a bottle of pills, and fed him one.</p>, <p>“For a person willing to sacrifice himself for the Dao College, I, Chen Ziheng, will absolutely not let him die just like that! Fellow schoolmate, you can now rest. Leave everything to me!” Chen Ziheng’s words were resolute and decisive. Complemented by his combat strength, he immediately projected a convincing impression into the hearts of everyone.</p>, <p>While everyone else expressed their gratitude, Wang Baole was dumbfounded as he stared at Chen Ziheng in a daze. Once again, he felt like the fellow in front of him had snatched his lines.</p>, <p>He wanted to redeem the situation, but as the medicine spread, Wang Baole turned dizzy, feeling so weak that he could not say a word. All he could do was lie there in anger and sadness. As he looked at the sky, which was gradually brightening, he only had one thought deep in his mind.</p>, <p><em>He must be like me. He’s cheating!</em></p>]',\n",
       " '[<p>While Wang Baole had fainted out of anger and sadness, the red hot-air cruiser in the real world continued crossing the sky rapidly. It was quickly approaching Ethereal City’s protectorate.</p>, <p>Chaos ensued in the main hull of the vessel.</p>, <p>“The Alchemy faculty wants Wang Baole!”</p>, <p>“Don’t even think about snatching him from my Combat faculty. He’s mine!”</p>, <p>Nearly all the teachers were flushed with excitement. They would bang the table at times while arguing incessantly about which faculty Wang Baole would join after he entered the Dao College.</p>, <p>All of this stemmed from Wang Baole’s self-sacrifice. The shock he had left with them was just too great. His bloody, mangled body had moved all of them. Plus, the words he had said were like bolts of lightning that shook their very core, especially his last sentence. It had made their hearts palpitate intensely.</p>, <p>“I live and die as part of Ethereal Dao College!”</p>, <p>This sentence effused bravery and loyalty. He was the kind of student that every faculty in the Dao College yearned for; therefore, how could they concede him to the others?</p>, <p>As the debate continued, a thin, middle-aged teacher with a goatee took out a jade card with reddened eyes when he realized that he was unable to recruit Wang Baole on his own.</p>, <p>He injected his spirit powers into it and roared, “My Dharmic Armament faculty uses its mandate that can only be used once every five years. We mandate that Wang Baole is to be a specially-recruited student of the Dharmic Armament faculty. None of you will snatch him from me!”</p>, <p>The moment he said those words, the jade card in his hands shimmered immediately. Instantly, the back of the crystal with Wang Baole’s name on it had the additional words ‘Dharmic Armament faculty’ on it.</p>, <p>This scene alarmed everyone. The mandate was just too precious. Typically, teachers would monitor the students after their matriculation before approving their enrollment into their respective faculties. Only a select few would be offered an olive branch by the faculty members.</p>, <p>Regardless, it was a choice that went both ways except… every faculty had one mandate that they could use once every five years. It could be used to mandate that a particular student would become a member of their faculty. Furthermore, it came with extravagant treatment and resources. The student would also gain special privileges that far exceeded their peers. It was like handing an important position to the student.</p>, <p>As a result of these perks, such a mandate was typically given to students with special backgrounds or those who excelled flawlessly. It was extremely precious.</p>, <p>Although Wang Baole was excellent, the others had hesitated to use their mandates on him. They could not help but shake their heads with a wry smile.</p>, <p>Upon seeing his colleagues’ expressions, Goatee felt that he had made the right decision. He believed that with Wang Baole’s character, his loyalty to the Dharmic Armament faculty would definitely be one of committed devotion after they nurtured him properly.</p>, <p>No matter how talented one was, it was still possible for them to commit acts of betrayal. The only ones who could not be bought with money were those with a righteous character and absolute loyalty. Only such disciples would step forward bravely at critical moments, making them worth every cent spent nurturing them! Goatee immediately became contented when he thought of this. He looked at the still-frowning old physician, who was staring at Wang Baole’s information in deep thought.</p>, <p>“Chancellor, our Dharmic Armament faculty has mandated that Wang Baole is ours. You have to be impartial about this.”</p>, <p>The old physician lowered his head and continued reading the dossier record as he spoke nonchalantly. “Don’t worry. He is yours, but I hope you do not regret it.”</p>, <p>The Ethereal Dao College had detailed information about every matriculated student starting from when they were young. There was a subtle keenness in his eyes as he said those words while reading the information.</p>, <p>“Chancellor, you…” Goatee was taken aback when he heard that. The other teachers were perplexed as well.</p>, <p>“He once attempted to lose weight for a month. He fasted and exercised vigorously, but not only did his weight not decrease, it increased. Such an impossible situation that does not happen to ordinary people happened to him.” The old physician sneered. He then flipped through the physical characteristics of every student in the Hallucination Nexus. His eyes landed on Wang Baole’s weight changes after the test began.</p>, <p>The old physician raised his head and said firmly, “If I’m not wrong, this Wang Baole has known for a while now that it is a virtual world. He knew that it was an exam and was cheating!”</p>, <p>“That’s impossible!” Goatee drew a gasp as he held his chest. He felt faint.</p>, <p>“We will know if he’s been cheating by testing him.” The old physician looked at Wang Baole through the crystal screen. His right hand rose to control the nexus as it suddenly stirred.</p>, <p>In the Hallucination Nexus, the students had just survived the calamity, but before they could rejoice, they suddenly heard an earth-shaking roar from the forest in front of them. It swept toward them like a storm.</p>, <p>Towering trees were destroyed from the sound waves and were blasted apart. The ground also quaked as a huge bear about a hundred feet tall crawled up from the ground and roared.</p>, <p>Most of its body appeared to be rotting, but its eyes had a ghostly fire, as though it had an undying body. It effused a suppressive might that left everyone trembling to the core. It was the overlord of the woods; its presence caused the woodland animals and birds to tremble in fear.</p>, <p>“That’s… that’s impossible. Heavens, that is an… Ancient Boor Specter Bear!”</p>, <p>“It’s… an Ancient Boor Specter Bear, a powerful being whose strength is equal to the perfected Ancient Martial realm, capable of tearing apart an expert at the second level of the Ancient Martial realm!”</p>, <p>Liu Daobin instantly turned limp, and Bunny, Du Min, and the rest revealed looks of extreme horror. Even the red-dressed youth had a drastic change in expression.</p>, <p>Most terrifying of all, the Ancient Boor Specter Bear charged straight for them after roaring. Every step it took shook the ground as it exuded an imposing might.</p>, <p>“Run, quick!” It was unknown who shouted as everyone began scattering on instinct. Even the color in the red-dressed youth’s face drained as he gave up the thought of putting up a fight. He quickly retreated.</p>, <p>Wang Baole was only jolted awake from his unconsciousness. When he saw the savage bear, his eyes lit up. His already weak body began heaving up and down rapidly.</p>, <p><em>There are actually more bonus points!</em></p>, <p>In his excitement, Wang Baole struggled to crawl toward the gigantic bear.</p>, <p>“Schoolmates, quickly leave. Ignore me. I’ll help you stall for time!” Wang Baole said as he barely managed to pick up a rock to throw at the approaching bear.</p>, <p>“Bear, eat me! As long as I, Wang Baole, am alive, I will absolutely not allow you to harm my schoolmates!” Wang Baole roared. The escaping students once again felt so touched that words could not describe it. Many of the girls even wept for him.</p>, <p>Inside the cruiser’s main hull, the old physician sneered when he saw the gigantic bear’s massive body charge at Wang Baole, about to rip him apart alive.</p>, <p>“See that? The excitement in the punk’s eyes. Have you ever seen anyone with such an expression while at death’s doorstep? It’s as though he’s afraid he won’t die.”</p>, <p>The other teachers all had strange expressions when they looked at Wang Baole. Wang Baole really looked heroic if they looked at him normally, but if they observed him with suspicion, the flaws in his act became apparent.</p>, <p>“This punk is way too shameless!”</p>, <p>“It would have been fine if he cheated, but he is acting way too out of line!”</p>, <p>The teachers in the main hull could not bear to continue watching. As for Goatee, he was clenching his teeth, feeling deep regret as his heart seemed to bleed. He was just short of beating his chest and stamping his feet.</p>, <p>“Heavens, my mandate!”</p>, <p>Finally, the old physician waved his right hand once again. Immediately, every image in the crystal shattered and dissipated.</p>, <p>“Alright, we will be landing in the Dao College soon. That’s the end of the test!”</p>, <p>The final scene Wang Baole saw was the moment the Hallucination Nexus collapsed. The gigantic bear had covered the sky, and following that, it turned turbid along with the world, before turning completely black.</p>, <p>When he regained consciousness again, he felt his body jolt. It felt like a force was pushing him forward. He opened his eyes, realizing that he was back in the cruiser’s Spirit Cultivation Chamber. He even heard the exclamations of the people around him.</p>, <p>“This… Weren’t we in the Pond Cloud Rainforest? Why are we here?”</p>, <p>“Was I dreaming or were all of us dreaming?”</p>, <p>Wang Baole blinked as he immediately feigned a blank look as he screamed!</p>, <p>“Quickly leave, all of you. Don’t bother about me. Bear, I’ll fight it out with you!”</p>, <p>His voice was just too loud. Due to his act of courage in the nexus, it was difficult not to win the attention of others. He immediately attracted many looks when he shouted. The students around him were even more agitated.</p>, <p>“It’s Brother Wang Baole!”</p>, <p>“What a great pal!”</p>, <p>“Wang Baole, you are the boss from now on!”</p>, <p>Du Min and Bunny were looking at him too. Having survived the calamity, the way they looked at Wang Baole was no longer the same, especially Bunny, whose eyes were brimming with tears. If she was not wearing the Magnetic Spirit attire and sitting a distance away, she might have leaped into his arms.</p>, <p>All of this left Wang Baole extremely pleased with himself. Just as he considered how he should receive the adoration of everyone, he heard a stern voice reverberate throughout the Spirit Cultivation Chamber.</p>, <p>“All students, we have arrived above the Dao College. Everything that just happened was part of our Ethereal Dao College’s freshman test. Your results will contribute to your overall grade… Finally, I would like to welcome you to Ethereal Dao College!”</p>, <p>Perhaps the stern voice managed to calm their hearts or perhaps it was the fact that they were close to the Dao College, but all the students inside the Spirit Cultivation Chamber collected themselves and psyched themselves up as they turned to look outside the windows.</p>, <p>Although Wang Baole felt a little wistful, he could not conceal his feelings of anticipation. When he looked down at the ground beneath him through a window, he immediately saw a massive lake. The lake looked like a mirror that paved the ground. It was extremely beautiful as it reflected the colors in the sky.</p>, <p>There were three islands in the lake aligned parallel to one another. There were many boats sailing between the islands. As they approached, one could even see buildings with an air of antiquity on the islands as well as numerous people.</p>, <p>In the periphery of the islands, it looked like there were tens of thousands of people, constituting a tiny city.</p>, <p>“Our Ethereal Dao College is a renowned college that was established in A.D. 2348. It experienced the Federation Era and participated in the battle of the beasts. It also ushered in the Spirit Inception Era and changed its teachings to the Dao. It has more than seven centuries of history and has nurtured countless elites and heroes. It has contributed significantly to the progress of mankind. Even the previous Federation President graduated from Ethereal Dao College.</p>, <p>“The lake you see is called the Green Forest Lake. As the saying goes, years as a green forest pass by happily, the happiness within matches that of a youth!</p>, <p>“As for the three islands, they are the Heaven Traversal Island, core to the Dao College, the Upper Academy Island for Dao disciples, and the Lower Academy Island for students like you. Of those who inherit our Ethereal Dao College’s legacy, there is the guiding principle to change the world and bring world peace!”</p>, <p>The stern voice resounded in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber. It was filled with pride as it spread through the hearts of everyone. Everyone, including Wang Baole, could not help but feel stirred by Ethereal Dao College’s presence and heritage.</p>, <p>As the Lower Academy Island beneath them rapidly increased in size, they could see more than ten towering mountain peaks on the biggest mountains. They looked like sharp swords that aimed for the skies.</p>, <p>Every mountain peak had countless buildings. There were huge words on them, which were especially clear, even when seen from the sky.</p>, <p>Dharmic Armament Faculty, Alchemy Faculty, Combat Faculty, Array Runes Faculty…</p>, <p>Before they were able to take note of everything, they felt a sudden jerk following a great boom. The cruiser had traversed five thousand kilometers from Phoenix City to land straight in the Lower Academy Island of Ethereal Dao College!</p>, <p>They had arrived at Ethereal Dao College!</p>]',\n",
       " '[<p>Ethereal Dao College was extremely large, especially with the Lower Academy Island, which was truly majestic. It could accommodate a hundred thousand students during their studies. In the southeastern area of the Lower Academy Island, dozens of gigantic hot-air balloon cruisers were parked in an aerial port.</p>, <p>There were countless students filled with curiosity and excitement. They were getting off the cruisers with their luggage in tow. Although it was noisy, it was mostly filled with joyful laughter.</p>, <p>These people came from different regions of the Federation. They were the new batch of students that had been accepted into the Dao Colleges.</p>, <p>On one cruiser’s deck, Wang Baole and company, who had come from Phoenix City, were carrying their luggage. All of them looked excitedly at the white clouds in the blue sky and the mountain peaks of the different faculties in the distance. They felt refreshed and were brimming with an indescribable sense of anticipation.</p>, <p>However, compared to their youthful spirits, the old physician and the other teachers who walked out from the main hull had strange expressions. They were already very familiar with the students who had come from Phoenix City.</p>, <p>They were especially familiar with Wang Baole. They could not help but glance at him a few more times.</p>, <p>Being accustomed to taking cues from the words and countenance of people, Wang Baole naturally noticed it. Although he was among a crowd of people, he was still concerned about the results of the test. He was constantly paying attention to where the teachers were. Only then did he notice that something was amiss.</p>, <p><em>Why are they looking at me like that? Are my results too heaven-defying? Haha, that must be the case.\\xa0</em>Wang Baole immediately turned excited. However, there was a sense of curiosity amid the excitement. The reason was that among the teachers, there was a man with a goatee whose eyes appeared both angry and sad when he looked at him.</p>, <p><em>What’s the situation?\\xa0</em>Wang Baole was perplexed. He found Goatee problematic, but before he could think through things carefully, all the teachers, including Goatee, walked straight for them.</p>, <p>As they approached, a person sped up among the teachers and said to the red-dressed youth, “Chen Ziheng, come here. I’ll show you to the registration booth.”</p>, <p>Chen Ziheng had a thought before he nodded and walked over before being taken away by the teacher. As they walked, they conversed. The teacher appeared to be giving him recommendations enthusiastically.</p>, <p>When Wang Baole saw this, his eyes lit up. Immediately, his breathing hastened. He had a guess. Would the results from the test begin showing their effects from this moment forth?</p>, <p>His heart raced as it filled with anticipation. He puffed his chest out, afraid that the teachers did not see him.</p>, <p>“Xu Liushan, follow me.”</p>, <p>“Liu Daobin, come.”</p>, <p>Soon, the teachers began shouting one name after another. The people called were taken away.</p>, <p>This scene made the hearts of people race. They could also tell that those who were named had done well in the test. They had won the favor of the teachers and were taken away ahead of the rest. They were offered olive branches from the respective faculties.</p>, <p>Wang Baole felt complacent. Although he did not hear a teacher shout out his name, he was very confident about his results in the test. He felt that the later one was called, the more excellent the students were. He even strongly looked forward to meeting the teacher who thought highly of himself.</p>, <p><em>What should I do if I caught the eye of all the teachers? Man, how troubling. I wonder how I should choose.\\xa0</em>Wang Baole felt happy deep down as he raised his head and puffed up his chest. However, after waiting all day, with even Du Min called away before, only about eighty percent of the hundreds of students were left beside him; he was somewhat dumbfounded.</p>, <p><em>No way…\\xa0</em>Wang Baole wiped the sweat from his forehead, finding it impossible to maintain his composure.</p>, <p>The teachers constantly took other students away until there were almost left. Almost all the teachers were gone, with the old physician leaving after taking a glance at Wang Baole. The only person left was Goatee, who looked like someone owed him a fortune. Wang Baole felt a little faint seeing this.</p>, <p>At that moment, the nasty-looking Goatee’s chest puffed up a few times. He looked extremely unwilling but was forced to do something out of no choice. It was as though he had to finish going down a path he had chosen. Only then did he shout, “Wang Baole, why aren’t you coming over yet?”</p>, <p>The words seemed to have been forced through his clenched teeth. After saying that, Goatee turned and disembarked the cruiser.</p>, <p>Wang Baole instantly became excited. He felt the voice was as beautiful as a lark’s. He did not have the time to consider the expression Goatee had. He ran over hurriedly and very obligingly followed Goatee. It appeared as though he would not hesitate to help carry any luggage he had if he had any.</p>, <p>As they left, the remaining disciples were made to disembark the cruiser. These students without anything special about them would choose their own faculties in the coming days.</p>, <p>Goatee was taking wide strides away from the Lower Academy Island’s aerial port, his face grim. There was a small cruiser parked in front of him, and standing by it were students from previous cohorts. They were waiting excitedly while decked in their blue college uniforms. Whenever they saw pretty girls walk past, they would immediately run over to introduce themselves warmly and show concern. When they saw Goatee arrive, they quickly acted reverently.</p>, <p>“Teacher, walk slowly. What faculty are we from?” Wang Baole’s breathless voice sounded from behind Goatee. Goatee was an expert himself, so he walked fast. Wang Baole, who had yet to cultivate any ancient martial arts, found it difficult to keep up.</p>, <p>Goatee was utterly depressed. He took out a purple jade pendant, threw it to the approaching Wang Baole, and snorted, “Report to the Dharmic Armament faculty by yourself. I have something to tend to and will be leaving first.”</p>, <p>With that said, he stepped into the small cruiser and quickly flew off.</p>, <p>Wang Baole was equally depressed after catching the jade pendant. He could also tell that something was wrong with the way the teacher had treated him.</p>, <p><em>Was my performance so good that it was seen through? Sigh. What faculty is the Dharmic Armament faculty?\\xa0</em>Wang Baole smacked his head and stood there with the jade pendant in hand. He felt vexed. He subconsciously took out a bag of snacks and began munching.</p>, <p>He felt that Goatee was just too unreliable. Helplessly, he could only seek out answers himself. Since it was matriculation day, there were many people on Ethereal Dao College’s Lower Academy Island. There was a sea of people at the aerial port, and their body heat only accentuated the hot weather.</p>, <p>Although there was a lake breeze, it only blew hot air over. Wang Baole stood there wiping his sweat. He saw a hawker stall selling ice water a distance away. It was advertised as Ice Spirit Water. Although it was expensive, Wang Baole was not the kind of person who would deny his wants. Even though it was expensive, he ran over and bought a few bottles before putting them in his luggage.</p>, <p>As he drank the chilly Ice Spirit Water, Wang Baole looked around. He looked at the bustling aerial port and even saw a few people live streaming the matriculation of the freshmen. He could also vaguely hear them requesting virtual gifts.</p>, <p>After asking around, Wang Baole did not waste too much time. He gained some understanding of the Dharmic Armament faculty and immediately felt pumped. He sat on a small cruiser that was headed for Dharmic Armament Peak.</p>, <p>There were many people at Dharmic Armament Peak as well. Some were visiting to make an informed choice of a faculty. Some had long made up their minds and were there to submit their applications.</p>, <p>There was also quite a number of volunteers, seniors of the Dharmic Armament faculty. They were responsible for welcoming the students. They showed the freshmen, who came in waves, around the faculty. There were heads bobbing up and down far into the distance. It was quite a lively scene.</p>, <p>As the crowd proceeded forward, Wang Baole heard a female senior with an oblong face give an introduction with great excitement and seriousness. It matched what he had heard about the Dharmic Armament faculty. He felt that it was quite an impressive faculty.</p>, <p>“The Dharmic Armament faculty might appear to be about the refinement of artifacts, but there is some difference to it. It’s about refining all items in the world into treasures!</p>, <p>“Our Ethereal Dao College’s Dharmic Armament faculty is considered the cream of the crop in all of the Federation. We are skilled in everything from Dharmic artifacts and combat artifacts to day-to-day artifacts used by commoners. Also, every student who graduates is greatly sought after.” The excitement in the senior’s voice showcased her pride in her faculty.</p>, <p>“Back when you were in the sky, you must have noticed the three massive platforms of my Dharmic Armament Peak. They represent the three main halls, where Spirit Stones, Inscriptions, and Spirit Kernels are studied!</p>, <p>“Unlike the foundational schools in our hometowns, there is relatively more freedom in the Dao College. There is no fixed curriculum for each faculty. From freshmen to seniors, they can enter any class to be instructed. As for the rest of the time, most people spend their time cultivating by themselves. Although there are exams every year, they are not very strict. Only the placement exam for the Upper Academy is critical.</p>, <p>“If you are unable to advance into the Upper Academy within five years, you will be asked to leave the Dao College.”</p>, <p>Wang Baole kept the tidbit in mind when he heard the female senior mention the placement exams. The people around him did the same.</p>, <p>“However, you need not be too worried. Advancing into the Upper Academy is still something very far off for you. Alright, this is where freshmen can apply to join the faculty.” Noticing that everyone was looking at her, the guide smiled. She stopped by a stone mirror about a hundred feet tall by the mountainside.</p>, <p>The stone mirror looked ancient, and it appeared as though it had experienced the vestiges of time. There were what seemed to be runic patterns on it. It looked very daunting.</p>, <p>“Place your application card on it, and you can descend the mountain. It will take the Lower Academy a maximum of three days to notify you of your acceptance. Each faculty will reveal their admission list too,” said the female senior before she wiped her sweat. Her mouth was a little dry from all the talking and heat. She stood by the side, looking at the students. She turned wistful as she seemed to see herself from yesteryear.</p>, <p><em>I wonder how many of them will be admitted. But then again, it can’t be many. After all, not more than four thousand are accepted per batch.\\xa0</em>As she sighed, Wang Baole immediately noticed that she was wiping her sweat. He scurried over, took out a cold bottle of Ice Spirit Water from his luggage, and handed it to her.</p>, <p>“Senior, it must have been tough on you. I would like to thank you on behalf of all us freshmen for explaining so much to us. You should drink some water in this scorching heat.” Wang Baole had an honest expression, and his voice sounded sincere. She could not help but size up the fatty in front of her. She immediately had a liking for him. His thoughtfulness was truly rare among all the freshmen she had guided.</p>, <p>The other schoolmates also looked over. After all, Wang Baole had not only represented himself, but all of them. It also gave them a good impression of him.</p>, <p>Wang Baole was pleased with himself when he saw how a bottle of Ice Spirit Water had garnered him good impressions from so many people. He felt that his potential as an official had risen once more.</p>, <p>Soon, the students approached the stone mirror with a sense of anticipation. One by one, they took out a blank jade card and placed it on the stone mirror. Light shot out from the jade card, signifying the completion of the imprint.</p>, <p>Everyone had one jade card. The teachers who accompanied them had handed the cards out after they arrived at the Lower Academy Island. However, Wang Baole was somewhat dumbfounded when he saw the jade cards in their hands.</p>, <p><em>What the heck? Why don’t I have one…\\xa0</em>Wang Baole quickly asked around, and after learning of the situation, he once again came to realize how unreliable Goatee was.</p>, <p>Wang Baole was the only one left after everyone else had imprinted their jade cards. The guide could not help but look at him and ask out of concern, “Junior, do you have any questions?”</p>, <p>“My card is a little different from the others.” Wang Baole hesitated for a moment as he fondled the purple jade pendant close to his chest. He carefully placed it on the stone mirror.</p>, <p>The instant the jade pendant touched the stone mirror, it suddenly released intense purple light. Even the stone mirror was illuminated in its entirety as a rumbling boom resounded throughout Dharmic Armament Peak.</p>, <p>There was a shock wave that blasted outwards. All the surrounding students felt their hearts jolt as they retreated in shock.</p>, <p>“What’s the situation?”</p>, <p>“What’s the matter?”</p>, <p>Even Wang Baole was given a fright.</p>, <p>That was not even the end. Even more astonishing were the majestic bells that resonated on Dharmic Armament Peak along with the soaring light. It seemed to reach a crescendo, as though it was about to announce something to the entire Dharmic Armament faculty!</p>, <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>, <p>Instantly, every student on Dharmic Armament Peak, be it the students ascending the mountain, the students in the lecture halls, or those cultivating in various buildings, looked up.</p>, <p>Beside the rock mirror, the senior with the oblong-shaped face felt her mind buzzing. She widened her eyes as they filled with disbelief. She exclaimed in shock, “Specially-recruited student!”</p>, <p>“What did you say?” Wang Baole was even more perplexed.</p>, <p>At the same time, a gong reverberated. On Dharmic Armament Peak, in a hall filled with Spirit Qi, Goatee was sat reading an ancient text. His originally calm heart turned restless once again.</p>, <p><em>Why did that little bastard come so quickly?\\xa0</em>He felt vexed. The thought of him losing the mandate that could only be used once in five years made him terribly regretful.</p>, <p>It would have been fine if no one had disturbed him, but the bell was reverberating loudly. Immediately, a few figures flew into the grand hall. They were the other teachers from the Dharmic Armament faculty.</p>, <p>“Daoist Zhang Youde, I heard you specially recruited a very promising student for our Dharmic Armament faculty!”</p>, <p>“Haha, Old Zhang, I always knew that you had a good eye. Where’s that good seedling? Quickly summon him and let us meet him.”</p>, <p>As teachers entered with excited looks, Goatee’s face turned ashen. The feeling was akin to having to tearfully finish eating the shit that he had just bought. He could only force a smile.</p>, <p>“That’s right. He’s a… good seedling! I have an artifact to refine. I’ll be making a move first…” With that said, he left quickly. He was afraid that if he stayed any longer, he would not be able to stop himself from smacking the good seedling to death!</p>]',\n",
       " '[<p>After finishing his registration and obtaining a cultivation technique, Daoist robes, and other miscellaneous items, Wang Baole put on the red Daoist robe meant for specially-recruited students. He was standing near a mountain peak. Although it was a little remote, he could not help but grin when standing before a beautiful building with excellent scenery.</p>, <p>In front of him was a purple stone door, which opened automatically, revealing a cave abode!</p>, <p><em>This is the legendary cave abode!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole could not contain his excitement. For many students, they could only reside in buildings that resembled dormitories. Only a select few had the right to live inside a cave abode at the mountain peak.</p>, <p>After all, that which is rare is dear. A mountain could have many buildings built, but the number of cave abodes was fixed. It was difficult to increase the number. Furthermore, the cave abodes had array formations that gathered Spirit Qi, making them have much denser Spirit Qi than the buildings.</p>, <p>Despite having a small cave abode, what Wang Baole had was enough to make countless students green with envy.</p>, <p>He could acutely feel how different his robe was from the other students’. He looked at his cave abode, and noticing that there was no one around, Wang Baole finally could not help but roar with laughter. He felt highly spirited. After entering the cave abode, he realized it had a veranda despite it not being very big. It stretched out twenty feet past the edge of the mountain peak. Standing there felt like he was standing in the sky. The complacent Wang Baole walked to the veranda and took in the scenery. He was in an extremely good mood as he took out a bag of snacks.</p>, <p>Wang Baole ate his snacks while he reveled in his good mood. He took out the martial cultivation technique that was unique to Ethereal Dao College. He saw, on the first page, three words written with bold, vigorous strokes!</p>, <p>Ancient Martial Arts!</p>, <p>It was not something unique to the Dharmic Armament faculty. All students in the Lower Academy were required to study this foundational cultivation technique. After freshmen were matriculated, they would enter their various faculties according to their choices, where they would learn all the unique knowledge the faculty had to offer. As for Ancient Martial Arts, it was provided to all faculties, intended as a foundational cultivation technique that supported the knowledge gained from each faculty.</p>, <p><em>The Ancient Martial realm has three stages: Blood Qi, Physical Seal, and Pulse Enrichment!\\xa0</em>As dusk approached, the wind turned colder. It blew at Wang Baole, making him feel extremely comfortable. The expression he had while reading the cultivation technique also turned more focused.</p>, <p>Only when the evening glow by the horizon was fully replaced by darkness did Wang Baole look up. He had finished reading the Ancient Martial Arts manual. He finally had a full understanding of the Ancient Martial realm.</p>, <p><em>Those at the Blood Qi stage have immense strength. Those at the Physical Seal are extremely precise and accurate. Once Pulse Enrichment is attained… one would be pushed to the peak of human physical conditioning!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole took a deep breath. He recalled the scene of the red-dressed youth, Chen Ziheng, striking the mountain. His eyes slowly began to burn with excitement.</p>, <p><em>To become Federation President, ancient martial arts are necessary. Besides, I can lose weight while cultivating in it. It kills many birds with one stone.\\xa0</em>In his excitement, Wang Baole began his attempt at cultivation. However, he suddenly had a change in expression. He raised his right hand and pulled out the black half-mask.</p>, <p>Wang Baole looked at the mask ruminatively. He could not forget how the mask had turned incorporeal during the test. There was also the blurry text that had appeared.</p>, <p><em>This must be a treasure!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole’s heart raced. His parents were involved in archeology, and it was for this reason that his house seemed to be filled with objects that appeared like junk.</p>, <p>Wang Baole had once fantasized that one of the antiques hid a treasure, but he had played with nearly every one of them from a young age. He had even secretly dripped some blood to see if anything spectacular would happen.</p>, <p>With the mask in hand, he carefully studied it once more. Other than the somewhat ice-cold material, he still did not notice anything extraordinary about it. When he finally recalled that the mask produced changes only in a special environment like the test, his eyes lit up.</p>, <p><em>It looks like there’s a need for me to borrow a similar Dharmic artifact. Perhaps, I can unravel the secrets of this mask!\\xa0</em>With this thought in mind, he noticed that the sky had turned dark. The somewhat tired Wang Baole returned to his cave abode and arranged his luggage happily. He had not packed a lot of clothes. Most of his items were strange. There was even a large megaphone.</p>, <p><em>All of these are treasures gathered by me to aid me in becoming an official. If I hadn’t been able to find my luggage in my dream, I would not have needed to go through so much hardship!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole yawned as he looked at the treasures in his luggage, satisfied. Just as he was about to sleep, he suddenly jolted and sat up.</p>, <p><em>I can’t grow dizzy from success. The high officials’ autobiographies illustrate many cases of people who lose themselves to their momentary success. They tend to end up in tragedy!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole drew a gasp. After repressing the excitement in him, he began pondering over the reason for the way the teachers looked at him and the way Goatee treated him. Matching it to his status as a specially-recruited student, the answer was evident.</p>, <p><em>They must have discovered that something was amiss.\\xa0</em>When Wang Baole came to this conclusion from his analysis, his heart turned cold as a chill ran down his spine.</p>, <p><em>I have to stay low during this period of time. It would be best if it appears as if I don’t exist. If not, there will only be trouble!\\xa0</em>Wang Baole turned vexed. He did not wish to lose everything he had at present. While suffering from his headache, he could not help but blame the lack of a backer for his predicament.</p>, <p><em>I need to think of a way to quickly get a backer.</em></p>, <p>Three days passed by quickly. As the various faculties released their lists of admitted students, all the students moved into their various faculty peaks. College life was about to begin after the matriculated students fully grasped the college rules and regulations.</p>, <p>Wang Baole kept a low profile during the three days. He began his attempt at cultivating Ancient Martial Arts. He virtually did not step out of his cave abode, afraid he would gain the notice of Goatee. He believed that he might be a lot safer if he survived the sensitive period.</p>, <p>Although he had a nice wish, news regarding the various districts’ tests began to spread on the Dao College’s Spirit Intranet as the students settled in. It quickly became a hot topic.</p>, <p>After all, nearly a hundred hot-air balloon cruisers with nearly a hundred venues had undergone their district tests simultaneously. Many excellent students caught the attention of people.</p>, <p>“Did you hear? Among one of the freshmen from Skycloud City is a person named Lu Jingnan. He actually set a trap to slay the Barbed Bone Iguana. He was extremely impressive!”</p>, <p>“That’s nothing. I heard that an expert named Chen Ziheng appeared in Phoenix City’s test. He is only just short of the Physical Seal stage of the Ancient Martial realm. He was offered invitations from eight different faculties at the same time. He’s famous!” As the Lower Academy Island’s various faculties began discussing the freshmen on the Spirit Intranet, more people were gradually mentioned.</p>, <p>“The one who steals the show must be Chen Yameng. Rumor has it that she was born with a spirit body. She can refine Spirit Stones that are eighty percent pure. She could have entered the best college in the Federation, White Deer Dao College, but our Ethereal Dao College spared no expense and gave her an irresistible offer!”</p>, <p>“Chen Yameng is truly extraordinary. There’s another person who is her equal. He might even surpass her. He’s Zhuo Yifan. Rumor has it that he was born with Inkstar Eyes. Every time he activates them, everything around him appears slow. Furthermore, he is already at the perfected Physical Seal stage. His identity is a greater mystery, and he is rumored to be a member of the Five Generation Sky Clan. He has been specially recruited by the Combat faculty!”</p>, <p>Amid the discussion, all the noteworthy freshmen were brought to the forefront. Even the senior students felt the heat when they heard the news. And for Wang Baole, who was desperately trying to keep a low profile, he rose to prominence like a bright star. After all, he had been specially recruited, and his performance in the test had been spread by hundreds of students from Phoenix City.</p>, <p>“There are two specially-recruited students this batch. One of them is Zhuo Yifan, and the other is… Wang Baole! Speaking of Wang Baole, he has extremely high morals. He is filled with righteousness and is willing to sacrifice himself for others. In order to save his schoolmates, he charged into a sea of snakes despite the appearance of a Red Bone White Neonate Snake. In order to give his schoolmates a chance to survive, he fed himself to the wolves. He once said the heart-stirring statement that he would live and die as one of Ethereal Dao College!”</p>, <p>“Also, even after seeing an Ancient Boor Specter Bear, Wang Baole still struggled to crawl over, despite his grievous injuries. He attempted to use his body to lure the Specter Bear away so as to save his schoolmates!”</p>, <p>This matter spread rapidly, causing Wang Baole to become famous. His name was soon known to all on the Lower Academy Island.</p>, <p>Wang Baole, through his voice transmission ring, could not help but turn cold from fright when he saw the talk on the Spirit Intranet after logging in. He felt that trouble was brewing, and he quickly posted a thread.</p>, <p>“Hello everyone, I’m Wang Baole. All of you were mistaken. I was actually very afraid back then. The reason I charged into the snake swarm was not that I am selfless, but that I find my schoolmate, Zhou Xiaoya, very pretty. I wanted to court her. Really…”</p>, <p>Wang Baole posted his message through clenched teeth. He hoped that he could lower the attention he received by sullying himself. He did not dare to keep a high profile.</p>, <p>But he did not imagine that the moment he posted the message, it quickly gained the affirmation and replies of countless students. Most of them were female students. They replied, calling him a real man!</p>, <p>Wang Baole nearly fainted as he was close to tears. He lamented about how he had bolstered the impressions people had of him despite believing that it would do the opposite. Thus, he posted another message.</p>, <p>“Actually, I only blocked the pack of wolves because I was poisoned. I knew I was about to die, so I would rather enjoy a quick death. The person who saved everyone was not me. All the credit should be given to Chen Ziheng!”</p>, <p>Wang Baole was just about to heave a sigh of relief after writing that. He felt that by giving Chen Ziheng all the credit, attention would be placed on Chen Ziheng and not him.</p>, <p>However… Wang Baole’s relief only lasted a short while. Chen Ziheng suddenly posted a reply, claiming that Wang Baole was inferior to him when it came to martial arts, but in terms of heroic spirit, tenacity, and selflessness, he was inferior to Wang Baole!</p>, <p>The moment the message was posted, it immediately caused the Spirit Intranet to boil over. After all, Chen Ziheng was famous. What he said carried weight. Immediately, countless people began discussing the matter. It made Wang Baole’s plan of diverting away attention fail once again. More attention was placed on him, even more than Chen Yameng.</p>, <p>All of this made Wang Baole feel like slamming his head against the wall. He reeled in despair as tears rolled down his cheeks. Even his organs were trembling.</p>, <p><em>Heavens, are you guys trying to get me killed? Spare me! I admit my mistake, alright?</em></p>, <p>With tears streaming down his cheeks, he gritted his teeth and posted once again.</p>, <p>“Everyone, please don’t mind me anymore. I’m just an ordinary fatty. There is nothing good about me. I’m gluttonous, lustful, and avaricious. I only barely passed the placement exams, and the Spirit Stones I can refine are only a little better than fifty percent. I’m really just an ordinary person!”</p>, <p>Wang Baole felt that this act of sullying of himself was complete. Any bad thing he could think of had been added. However, the development of the situation nearly shocked his jaw off.</p>, <p>This time, it was Liu Daobin who stepped forward. He left a message that resonated in an unprecedented manner with countless students!</p>, <p>“Chen Yameng is impressive. Zhuo Yifan is even more remarkable. However, they were already the best of us freshmen. They have more than what it takes to rescue people or complete tests, but Wang Baole is different. He was saving people with his life. It’s just like how a wealthy person can give you a hundred Spirit Stones, but when compared to a poor person who gives you all his savings of a hundred Spirit Stones, how can that act have the same meaning? Wang Baole is just like us. He is only an ordinary student, so how can he be without flaws? But it is such a person, with him sacrificing himself to save others, that makes it even more shocking. That bloody scene is something I will never forget my entire life!”</p>, <p>His words immediately stirred a fervor. It caused the comments on the Lower Academy Island’s Spirit Intranet to increase exponentially. Topics on Wang Baole exceeded Zhuo Yifan’s, making him stand out amid the batch of freshmen!</p>, <p>Wang Baole was completely dumbfounded as he looked at the Spirit Intranet in a daze. He did not think he was that great. It took him a while to recover as his eyes were filled with despair. He took out a bag of snacks while looking as though life held nothing for him. He began munching on the snacks.</p>, <p><em>I’m finished. I’m finished! I’m in big trouble!</em></p>, <p>Indeed, it did not take long before the teachers on the Phoenix City cruiser took notice. They could not maintain their silence and publicly announced the news that Wang Baole had cheated on the test.</p>, <p>Like massive ripples formed from a stone drop, the announcement immediately caused a huge upheaval all across the Lower Academy Island!</p>]',\n",
       " '[<p>On a scorching summer day, east of the Federation, fog emanated through Pond Cloud Rainforest like thin chiffon. Ancient towering trees interlocked each other, and birds would occasionally flit through the lush tree crowns, chirping as they flapped their wings and flew across the horizon.</p>, <p>High in the sky, the sun, which had seemed capable of existing eternally, no longer appeared anything like how people remembered. Instead, it had been penetrated by an ancient greenish-bronze sword—one so indescribably massive—many years ago! Only a small portion of the sword’s tip was exposed!</p>, <p>The ancient sword had come from the cosmos and seemed to express its antiquity. There was a potent suppressive force that formed a halo, which enveloped the firmament as though it held the land in place, letting all life revere it!</p>, <p>The Sword Sun and the rainforest looked picturesque from afar but was disturbed by a humming sound that came from a distance. A red hot-air balloon flew slowly toward the rainforest.</p>, <p>The hot-air balloon’s hull was very large, capable of holding hundreds of people. In there, many young men and women in groups of three or four chatted happily.</p>, <p>They were new students of Ethereal Dao College, one of the four great Dao Colleges in the Federation. They hailed from Phoenix City and were onboard Ethereal Dao College’s cruiser, traversing thousands of kilometers, to seek higher education.</p>, <p>Perhaps because they were all greatly anticipating their upcoming education—not to mention the unspoken attraction between men and women—the students had plenty of fun on the five-thousand-kilometer voyage.</p>, <p>Due to the long distance, the cruiser was equipped with dining halls, cultivation chambers, medical facilities, and many other amenities.</p>, <p>There were quite a number of students in the cruiser’s dining hall. Sitting at a table was a young fatty with his belly bulging out.</p>, <p>He was about seventeen years old, and he wore a blue baggy robe. His tiny rotund face could barely be considered to have intricate features. As he created smacking sounds while patting his belly, he gazed at the eight empty plates in front of him, a little regretful.</p>, <p><em>I’ll have gained another one and a half kilograms after this meal. Why didn’t I bear with it? I can’t die early if I want to become the Federation President.\\xa0</em>The fatty frowned with a grimace as he felt filled with regret, burping in the process.</p>, <p>The young fatty’s name was Wang Baole. He was also one of the students who had recently been accepted into Ethereal Dao College. His lifelong dream was to become an official, or more precisely, become the Federation President. The reason he had such an ambitious dream was intricately tied to a childhood experience of his.</p>, <p>In his memories, his father would frequently pat him on the head while speaking earnestly and sighing wistfully.</p>, <p>“Baole, being an official is the best. Remember, although money can solve everything, you can still be bullied by others. If you do not want to be bullied, the only way is to be an official, becoming a person who lords over the rest.”</p>, <p>Wang Baole did not understand his father’s words until he entered elementary school. One fateful day, he failed to hand in his homework on time and ended up being berated by the class monitor. Despite giving the class monitor two sweets, his name was still jotted down, and the class monitor snitched on him. All of this left a permanent mark in his young heart.</p>, <p>Hence, he wished to become the class monitor from that moment forth. It was not to bully others, but to ensure that he would not be bullied by others.</p>, <p>But as he grew up, he realized that many people bullied the class monitors. Therefore, he felt that only by becoming the highest official—the Federation President—could he ensure that no one would dare bully him. The reason he had racked his brains to enter Ethereal Dao College was because all the Federation’s high officials had graduated from the four great Dao Colleges.</p>, <p>However, he did not lead a blessed life. His family clan’s bloodline was quite an oddity. He even remembered that night one year ago when his father, who could be described as a bag of bones, had shown him the family tree.</p>, <p>It was the first time Wang Baole had seen it. He realized that all his ancestors had died early—before the age of thirty-five—if their body weight exceeded a hundred kilograms.</p>, <p>That night, Wang Baole had a dream… He had reunited with his fat forefathers before he successfully became the Federation President.</p>, <p>The matter of losing weight was elevated to something of great importance over the following year. The Spirit Inception Era meant rich Spirit Qi and a renewed interest in ancient martial arts; therefore, there were many weight-loss techniques. However, Wang Baole’s weight remained stable, despite the new era. He even experienced a slight rise in weight even after he attempted all of them.</p>, <p>As his memories surfaced, Wang Baole gritted his teeth, steeling his resolve to begin losing weight the next day.</p>, <p>Having made up his mind, Wang Baole immediately felt relieved. As he picked his teeth, he hummed a tune while looking at the distant blue sky outside the windows. His mind became active again.</p>, <p><em>I wonder if Physician Lu likes the gift I gave him. That is an antique I got from home. That old geezer will probably like it.\\xa0</em>Wang Baole comforted himself and guessed that if he managed to win Physician Lu’s favor, it would be equivalent to him having a tiny backer in the Dao College.</p>, <p><em>Teachers have limits to their authority, but I still have to give them some gifts in the future. Being so old, Physician Lu definitely has quite a wide social circle. I have likely taken the right step.\\xa0</em>Upon thinking of this, Wang Baole felt delighted. In his mind, he was one step closer to the position of the Federation President.</p>, <p>In regard to becoming the Federation President, he was very confident. This confidence stemmed from his research of the autobiographies of high officials, which he had gathered from a young age. He had even figured out a few trump cards needed in order to become a high official.</p>, <p>He was in a good mood as he looked at the blue skies outside the window, finding it especially beautiful.</p>, <p>But then, his eyes suddenly widened. He noticed that a black cloud was gathering in the distant sky. It spread out, covering the sky as lightning bolts flashed within it. The cloud slowly approached, and it also gained the attention of many as they exclaimed.</p>, <p>“It’s an electromagnetic pulse!”</p>, <p>Wang Baole was alarmed as well. After the Spirit Inception Era was ushered in, the appearance of Spirit Qi caused many stunning phenomena to arise in the world. Flying crafts from the past could no longer ensure safe travel. It resulted in the production of hot-air balloon cruisers propelled by Spirit Stones.</p>, <p>Amid constant exclamations, a rumbling thunder suddenly boomed. The black electromagnetic clouds burgeoned in size rapidly as the lightning within began spreading outward. Like a black net, it illuminated the horizons in a dazzling manner, causing the hearts of the spectators to race. Even the cruiser slowed down.</p>, <p>Just as people were feeling apprehensive, the door to the dining hall was pushed open. As though a cool wind had rushed in, a white-robed elder entered. His face was covered in wrinkles, but he had an ethereal air to him. His appearance exuded a feeling of propriety, especially his shimmering eyes, making him look like a person of righteousness. The moment he arrived, his domineering voice resounded throughout the dining hall.</p>, <p>“Everyone is to immediately report to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber. Wear your Magnetic Spirit attire, for we will be entering the electromagnetic domain in less than three minutes!”</p>, <p>The moment he spoke, all the students in the dining hall hurriedly stood up reverently.</p>, <p>Wang Baole’s eyes lit up. The elder in front of him was Physician Lu, the person he had previously gifted. From how he walked with flair, Wang Baole was increasingly convinced that his investment from before was right. He thought to himself that the old man was likely someone extraordinary, and he had really made the right move.</p>, <p>Just as he was reveling in his delight, the old physician swept his gaze across the room and saw Wang Baole. With a snort, he walked over, took out half a black mask, and threw it at him.</p>, <p>“Don’t waste your efforts on such inane acts when you are still so young. To think you have already learned the art of gifting before you’ve even entered the Dao College. I’m quite a learned person with experience. Keep the mask for yourself.” The old physician’s expression was solemn. He reprimanded Wang Baole with an honest and upright demeanor, as though he expected better from him.</p>, <p>Wang Baole received the mask as his heart skipped a beat. He turned somewhat worried, as he could tell that the old physician was angry. Just as he was about to give an explanation, he suddenly recalled one of the trump cards he had learned from the high officials’ autobiographies. One of them was that it was wise to thicken one’s skin to admit one’s mistakes in front of a superior. Typically, that would reduce a major issue to a minor one.</p>, <p>Therefore, he took a deep breath and hurriedly took on a contrite and penitent look to admit his fault.</p>, <p>“Teacher, you are right; I was at fault!”</p>, <p>The old physician turned a little intrigued. He could not deliver his planned tirade when the student had admitted his mistake so readily.</p>, <p>Wang Baole heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the old physician’s expression. He felt a little smug, thinking how useful the high officials’ autobiographies were.</p>, <p>The old physician snorted, raised his head, and scanned all the students in the dining hall. He raised his right hand and pointed at them.</p>, <p>“And all of you. All of you are future students of our Ethereal Dao College, but look at what you have been doing the past few days. You have to forever remember that, as warriors, we should first establish ourselves, watch our speech, and finally mind our conduct!”</p>, <p>The vice-abhorring physician’s words resounded through the dining hall. Everyone who heard it could not help but lower their heads in shame. As for Wang Baole, his eyes immediately lit up. He felt it was the appropriate moment for him to shine.</p>, <p>He quickly took out a tiny notebook and began writing on it. From time to time, he would raise his head to look at the old physician with a diligent and attentive look on his face. At times, he would even nod seriously as though he was trying to remember every single word. Obviously, this was also from the teachings in the high officials’ autobiographies.</p>, <p>When his other classmates saw this, they looked at Wang Baole as though they were looking at a man of God.</p>, <p>The old physician momentarily fell into a daze when he saw this. An unprecedented sense of oddness arose in his heart. This was the first time he had encountered such an oddity after enrolling so many batches of students. He could not help but take a few looks at him before he slowly sneered.</p>, <p>“Little fellow, it’s not that easy to suck up to me. You ought to thank the electromagnetic pulse. If not for that, I would have reprimanded you for three days and three nights. I would be rather interested to see if you can write all of that in your tiny notebook!”</p>, <p>The moment he said those words, the mood immediately changed. The aura of an expert emanated from his body as it seemed to manifest as a suppressive force that blanketed the entire dining hall. Every student became alarmed. They all felt that the old physician clearly had the upper hand in the battle of wits.</p>, <p>Wang Baole blinked as he touched the recording jade slip in his pocket. After weighing the situation and noticing how they were approaching the electromagnetic pulse steadily, he gave up the thought of taking it out. He felt that backing down in front of a superior was nothing embarrassing.</p>, <p>The old physician became delighted when he saw the expressions on everyone. He generously threw them a few more words of motivation.</p>, <p>“Remember, put all your effort into cultivating. In the future, you must not be greedy or deceitful. Don’t even think about finding girlfriends. I have to make it known to you that lust and danger are just two sides of the same coin! The way all of you have been acting for the past few days has been preposterous!”</p>, <p>Just as he said that, a sweet voice suddenly sounded from the old physician’s voice transmission bangle.</p>, <p>“Grandpa Physician, where are you? Where do the Magnetic Spirit clothes go on? What should it cover? Quick, come and help me.”</p>, <p>The charming voice made the old physician tremble involuntarily. He barely forced a dry cough as he stared sternly at everyone. Only then did he turn around in a rush, and at the same time, he spoke excitedly into the voice transmission bangle. “Oh, I’m coming. Baby, don’t fret. I’m coming to help you right now.”</p>, <p>The turn of events had simply happened too quickly, and the contrast was striking. Everyone was dumbfounded, and even Wang Baole was taken aback. He drew a deep breath moments later. Following that, there was an uproar as Wang Baole clenched his teeth and cursed.</p>, <p><em>Shameless! What that old pervert said was utter bullshit! There are only so many female schoolmates. There aren’t enough for all of us, but he is actually trying to snatch resources from us at his age. Isn’t it all because he’s some kind of official?</em></p>, <p>Wang Baole became more infuriated the more he thought about the matter. He joined in the conversations with the classmates around him. It only strengthened his determination to become an official.</p>, <p>Another alarm sounded, ending everyone’s conversations. All of them immediately rushed to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber.</p>, <p>The Spirit Cultivation Chamber was located in the core region of the cruiser, and like its name, it was a place for students to cultivate. At the same time, it was the place where the most security was deployed whenever the cruiser crossed any special zones.</p>, <p>As people gathered in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, they were made to sit in rows under the direction of the Ethereal Dao College teachers. They were dressed in the Magnetic Spirit clothes that Ethereal Dao College had handed out.</p>, <p>Wang Baole was still dwelling on his anger toward Physician Lu even after he changed into the Magnetic Spirit clothes. He casually looked up and surveyed his surroundings. His depression immediately turned for the worse when he spotted a certain someone. He could not help but furrow his brows as he gave a look of disparagement.</p>, <p>Sitting where his sight had landed was a girl with long, slender legs. She looked charming, but she had her brows knitted and a look of disgust, too. Clearly, they were very familiar with each other but also hated each other from the looks they were giving one another.</p>, <p><em>What bad luck!</em></p>, <p>Both of them grumbled inwardly as they looked away. It was as though just a glance of each other was a sore sight.</p>, <p>“I see that flat-chested Du Min, everywhere I go. How irritating!” Wang Baole muttered under his breath. He had been classmates with the girl, Du Min, ever since he began schooling. She was usually proud and aloof, and she constantly made things difficult for him as her role as class monitor. She also happened to be the receiver of the two sweets he had given back then.</p>, <p>“What’s so impressive about her? Isn’t she just some lame class monitor? When we arrive at the Dao Colleges, I’ll use the teachings of the officials and get some kind of official role!” snorted Wang Baole.</p>, <p>Soon, everyone had changed their clothing. The teachers in the Ethereal Dao College cruiser checked everyone’s attire and explained certain important matters. They also warned everyone that things could become dangerous once the cruiser entered the electromagnetic domain. The risk of death was not negligible.</p>, <p>After everyone’s expression changed, the teachers left solemnly. The door to the Spirit Cultivation Chamber was sealed as the lights dimmed.</p>, <p>Although there were murmurs in the Spirit Cultivation Chamber, the nervousness people felt turned more intense over the passage of time. Gradually, no one spoke as the chamber fell into silence.</p>, <p>It got so quiet that they could hear their own heartbeats. Even Wang Baole, who still felt disgruntled, turned nervous. As the remaining minutes counted down, the entire cruiser suddenly shook, signifying its entry into the electromagnetic domain!</p>, <p>Outside, the black electromagnetic clouds looked extremely grand. It resembled a huge mouth that seemed to devour the tiny hot-air balloon cruiser.</p>, <p>This phenomenon contained a destructive might that could sweep away everything. Perhaps only the stunning Sword Sun above the heavens could ignore such destruction, as though it could weather that turmoil and anything else thrown at it for millennia to come.</p>, <p>This year was the 37th year of the Spirit Inception Era.</p>, <p>In A.D. 3029, Earth’s technology progressed rapidly, and the world was united with no national borders. It entered a federation era, and it was during this period that the massive sword flew from the cosmos and penetrated the sun, sending shockwaves across the world.</p>, <p>The hilt of the sword might have been damaged from the beginning, but the powerful impact shattered it into numerous fragments, which scattered across space, with portions of it landing all over the Earth.</p>, <p>Accompanying the arrival of the greenish-bronze sword and the falling of the fragments, the Earth suddenly had a perpetual new source of energy that permeated everywhere. It was later named… Spirit Qi!</p>, <p>Spirit Qi was like air. Some places were denser and others thinner. The Federation and other factions obtained the scattered fragments, and through them, found the relevant information needed for cultivation training and cultivation artifacts, pill refinement, and Spirit Stone refinement. The text on the fragments looked ancient, which made people’s interest in ancient texts become mainstream.</p>, <p>The appearance of Spirit Qi quickly eliminated the need for all existing resources. It changed the lives of people and formed the Spirit Internet. It also changed the progress of Earth’s civilization. It initiated a cultivation civilization all over Earth.</p>, <p>From then on, ancient martial arts became popular as a revolutionary change happened throughout the world. Thus, the era of immortal cultivation began.</p>, <p>History called it the Spirit Inception Era.</p>, <p>In the black electromagnetic cloud, the red hot-air balloon cruiser slowly proceeded forward. Lightning flashed continuously as bolt after bolt struck the cruiser incessantly. Thankfully, there was a soft halo surrounding the cruiser, allowing it to fly stably.</p>, <p>As for the Spirit Cultivation Chamber in the cruiser’s core, all the students, including Wang Baole, were in there. They had unknowingly fallen asleep as though there was a strange power that pulled them into a dream.</p>, <p>At the cruiser’s helm were eight teachers. Some of them were drinking tea while others were smiling. They were having light-hearted conversations, looking completely different from when they frightened their students.</p>, <p>Their leader was an elder with a face covered in wrinkles. He held a smoke pipe as he sucked on it. If Wang Baole was here, he would definitely have recognized him as the shameless Physician Lu.</p>, <p>The old physician smiled faintly when a middle-aged teacher asked, “Chancellor, everything is in order. Shall we begin the trial for this student cohort?”</p>, <p>“Begin!”</p>]',\n",
