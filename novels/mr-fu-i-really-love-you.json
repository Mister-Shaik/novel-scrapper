  "Chapter 1: A Love That Couldn’t Be Touched": "<p>Although it was the start of autumn, the city of Haicheng rained heavily for a few continuous days, causing the whole city to be enveloped in mist and the air to be especially humid and cold.</p> <p>Once she exited the cafe, Lin Nuan felt the chill in the air.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan?!”</p> <p>Gu Hanyan rushed out of the cafe and grabbed Lin Nuan who was holding up an umbrella. She yelled in her shrill voice, “The four years when Moshen went missing, his inheritance rights, company shares, and even the car and house under his name were taken away by his younger brother, Wen Moshi!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s back froze slightly.</p> <p>“The only thing I can save for Wen Moshen now is myself! I don’t want to see the day Moshen returns only to find that he has nothing left…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt a blow to her heart, bringing her deep pain—</p> <p>Wen Moshen was a love that couldn’t be touched, hidden at the bottom of Lin Nuan’s heart.</p> <p>Gu Hanyan stood unprotected from the rain, while Lin Nuan stayed under the shadows of her umbrella; the two were at a stalemate.</p> <p>Lin Nuan pulled back her wrist from the other’s grip, took out a large black coat from her shoulder bag and wrapped it around herself to draw away some of the chill seeping into her bones.</p> <p>“You can force me now only because… because I love Wen Moshen, but if he returns one day and finds out the truth, I will surely become an irremovable thorn wedged between the two of you. Gu Hanyan… do you dare to take that chance?”</p> <p>Gu Hanyan’s lips trembled as she wanted to reply yes, but she was afraid that answering without hesitation would cause her love to sound shallow. As she wavered, her almond-shaped eyes turned red and a teary mist covered them, making her seem all the more delicate and pitiful in the rain.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s fair, slim fingers gripped tightly onto the umbrella, her knuckles turning white. Her gaze was clean and calm as she waited for Gu Hanyan’s reply.</p> <p>Gu Hanyan said nothing for a long time; Lin Nuan turned to leave, yet when her gaze fell on the other side of the road… on the tall brooding man standing beside the Bentley, she paused in surprise.</p> <p>The black car was parked right underneath the streetlight. The orange light scattered amongst the raindrops to create a soft, misty halo that landed on the man’s broad shoulders, outlining his tough facial features.</p> <p>A man with such outstanding looks and a strong stable aura would shine wherever he was, to the point where he was impossible to ignore…</p> <p>It was Fu Huai’an!</p> <p>She didn’t know why, but seeing Fu Huai’an at that moment, Lin Nuan actually felt a trace of guilt pushing her to feel insecure.</p> <p>Even though she hadn’t yet decided on whether to help Gu Hanyan, even though she hadn’t done anything yet, she started panicking once she saw Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>A gust of wind mixed with raindrops blew over, chilling Lin Nuan’s entire body almost instantly.</p> <p>Lin Nuan clenched her fist around the umbrella tightly, frozen as she watched the man opposite her. She desperately wanted to tear her uneasy gaze away from him, but her body was as still as a statue and she was unable to move.</p> <p>A middle-aged man had walked out together with Fu Huai’an from the Fragrance Residences… Seeing that Fu Huai’an had a cigarette between his fingers, he tried buttering up to him by holding up a lighter with both hands, wanting to light the cigarette for Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s hair and stiff suit were slightly wet from the rain, and he had one hand in his pocket. It was a pose that made him seem superior to others, his pride showing through his expression along with an aura of nobility.</p> <p>Accompanying Fu Huai’an was his good friend Lu Jinnan who, the moment after he exited the Fragrance Residences, noticed Lin Nuan on the other side of the road. He raised a brow in surprise and adjusted his collar, his uplifted eyes narrowing by half as he walked towards Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“President Wang, do you mind helping me go to the convenience store on the other side of the road to buy a pack of cigarettes?”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan spoke with a casual tone, and the middle-aged man standing beside Fu Huai’an nodded his head continuously, agreeing without hesitation. “No problem, President Lu!”</p> <p>“Thanks!” Lu Jinnan said, without any sincerity.</p> <p>Watching the chubby President Wang jog off, Fu Huai’an calmly extinguished the cigarette in his hand.</p> <p>It was a high-end brand cigarette that someone gave him earlier during the meal, not the brand he was used to smoking.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan took out a box of cigarettes from his pocket and passed one cigarette to Fu Huai’an, biting onto another as he said, “Old Fu, your moonlight <sup>1</sup> is right there across the road.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an paused in the middle of lighting up his cigarette and looked at Lu Jinnan with a deep and heavy gaze.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan bit onto his cigarette and stuck both of his hands into his pockets, jerking his chin in Lin Nuan’s direction and said, “I’m not kidding you, she’s over there with your fiancée, Gu Hanyan…”</p> <p>The cigarette was lit, white smoke rising up from the corner of his lips as Fu Huai’an put away his lighter; his deep and unreadable eyes looked towards the opposite side of the road, quickly spotting the woman watching him.</p> <p>Just one gaze was enough for the tight strand in Lin Nuan’s heart to break—she thought of Gu Hanyan’s earlier words while they were inside the cafe, and her sweaty palms tightened their grip on her umbrella guiltily.</p> <p>The heavy white smoke blurred Fu Huai’an’s cold and sharp face, yet Lin Nuan still felt a strong and heavy pressure closing in on her, causing her to panic.</p>",
  "Chapter 2: Is It Necessary for You to Plan Such a Huge Trap?": "<p>Lu Jinnan bit onto the cigarette butt, his gaze fearlessly sizing up Lin Nuan across the road and said, “Women—just give them a car, some flowers, a bag, and a card, and it’s pretty easy to coax them into bed. Is it necessary for you to plan such a huge trap?”</p> <p>“She’s different from those women of yours,” Fu Huai’an’s deep voice replied calmly, a smile ghosting the corner of his lips in between the puffs of white cigarette smoke.</p> <p>“She’s indeed different. I investigated that Lin Nuan before; a flower at the radio station that no one has ever managed to tarnish. She’s really hard to obtain, too smart, and quite good at faking it.” Lu Jinnan spoke with a sour tone, “So you like the kind that’s harder to get?</p> <p>Or… do you like it when women who are harder to obtain submit themselves to you?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an pressed the area between his brows with the hand holding the cigarette. He remained silent, and the look in his eyes seemed distant and fathomless.</p> <p>A car drove over—Lin Nuan ignored the puddles of water on the road and left the pavement, reaching her hand out to stop the car…</p> <p>“Lin Nuan?!”</p> <p>Gu Hanyan called her name, but Lin Nuan didn’t look back.</p> <p>A mixture of mud and ice-cold water soaked Lin Nuan’s white sports shoes, but she didn’t even notice it. She was anxious to escape a place so close to Fu Huai’an. It was only after entering the cab and the warm air hit her that she realized her feet were freezing.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Nuan held her umbrella and stood in front of Fu Huai’an’s villa, hesitating.</p> <p>Because of Gu Hanyan’s last words, once Lin Nuan reached her house, she again gave the cab driver Fu Huai’an’s address.</p> <p>She was afraid that after tonight, she would lose the courage to come and find Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“Miss Lin…”</p> <p>Upon hearing a voice, Lin Nuan raised her head and saw that Fu Huai’an’s housekeeper had already opened the door to the house. She jogged over to Lin Nuan while carrying an umbrella.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had once sent Fu Huai’an’s son back home, thus his housekeeper had seen her before and recognized her.</p> <p>The warm light inside the house shone out from the door, making individual raindrops clear and distinct…</p> <p>“I saw someone was standing outside without moving for such a long time so I came out to take a look. I didn’t think that it would be Miss Lin!” Auntie Li gave a friendly smile to Lin Nuan. “Is Miss Lin here today to see Tuan Tuan? Tuan Tuan misses you and talks about you every day. He keeps saying that Miss Lin promised to come visit him.”</p> <p>The sound of the heavy rain hitting the umbrella couldn’t drown out Auntie Li’s happy voice…</p> <p>She quickly invited Lin Nuan into the house, saying, “It’s pouring outside right now! Quickly enter the house, Miss Lin.”</p> <p>“Is Mr. Fu back?” When Lin Nuan asked the question, her grip on the umbrella subconsciously tightened and her heart felt unavoidably anxious.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s voice was very small and almost couldn’t be heard. Auntie Li took a while to process the question before she reacted and smiled, replying, “Sir is not back yet…”</p> <p>A car’s bright headlights shone over and Lin Nuan immediately froze in her steps.</p> <p>Inside the car, Fu Huai’an’s assistant saw the car light hitting Lin Nuan, whose pants were already half-drenched. She was standing together with Auntie Li with a slightly pale face. The assistant looked at Fu Huai’an through the rearview mirror, saying, “Boss, it’s Miss Lin…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an had lowered his head, his deep eyes focused on his phone’s screen. The light from the screen outlined Fu Huai’an’s cold features, emotionless without a hint of warmth…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked up, and indeed it was Lin Nuan…</p> <p>Lin Nuan raised her hand to block the car’s overly bright light, her heartbeat increasing.</p> <p>The car came to a stop and Fu Huai’an’s assistant exited the car and greeted Lin Nuan briefly before jogging over to the other side of the vehicle. He held an umbrella to escort Fu Huai’an outside.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an stepped out of the car, his suit still immaculate—even his leather shoes were clean and had only a few rainwater droplets on them. It was a sharp contrast compared to Lin Nuan’s disheveled look.</p> <p>Lin Nuan subconsciously straightened her back.</p> <p>“Sir is back…” Auntie Li smiled and spoke in a happy tone.</p> <p>“It’s raining too hard, you should go in first,” Fu Huai’an said to Lin Nuan in a low voice.</p> <p>Lin Nuan followed after Fu Huai’an and entered the house. Auntie Li drew a bath for her, finding her some clean clothes.</p> <p>“Miss Lin, since the rain is too heavy and Jing’er road has been flooded, you definitely won’t be able to go home tonight. Sir said to let you rest for here for the night, and you can leave tomorrow.” Auntie Li passed a clean set of clothes to Lin Nuan, “This is a new set of pajamas Sir just bought yesterday; it’s washed and unworn. Your clothes are all soaked, so please make do with this for now. Dinner is already prepared so you can come down and eat after you’re done bathing.””</p> <p>“Thank you…” Lin Nuan took the pajamas.</p> <p>Lin Nuan took a hot bath in the bathroom of the guest room, feeling much better afterward.</p>",
  "Chapter 3: Jealousy With a Hidden Motive": "<p>She sat on the edge of the bed and wiped her hair dry, pondering how to talk to Fu Huai’an about Gu Hanyan. She actually wasn’t very familiar with him.</p> <p>Requesting him to cancel his engagement sounded ridiculous no matter how she thought about it. It might even make people think that she was being jealous and had a hidden motive.</p> <p>Lin Nuan wiped her hair with frustration.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan went to find Fu Huai’an, he had already finished his dinner and was heading upstairs.</p> <p>The two met at the narrow top of the staircase on the second floor. Lin Nuan didn’t give herself the chance to retreat; she opened her mouth and said with a clear voice, “Mr. Fu, I came with a request.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an, one hand holding a cup of coffee and the other in his pocket, walked up the last step, his tall figure standing against the light. Lin Nuan was completely covered by his shadow. The great sense of pressure made Lin Nuan hold on tightly to the corner of her shirt, her brows furrowed as she straightened her back, subconsciously not wanting to show any cowardice.</p> <p>Their gazes met—Fu Huai’an’s eyes were peaceful and deep, as though he could easily see through other people’s hearts.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s intuition told her that Fu Huai’an preferred those who went straight to the point. If she tried to play tricks in front of him and talked in a roundabout way, she would surely be exposed.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an didn’t push her—he patiently waited for Lin Nuan to speak…</p> <p>Taking in a deep breath, she threw away the speech she’d prepared in her mind and simplified her words, saying, “Mr. Fu, perhaps you don’t know, but Gu Hanyan was once Wen Moshen’s fiancée, and up until now she is still waiting for Wen Moshen to return.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s pure black eyes caused Lin Nuan to panic in her heart; she was afraid Fu Huai’an would think she had bad intentions.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had just finished bathing, and her slightly curled hair fell loose at her waist. Seeing that Fu Huai’an was watching her with a heavy gaze, she tucked her long hair behind her ear to cover up her embarrassment.</p> <p>“As the saying goes, gentlemen do not snatch what others love, nor will they push others into a difficult corner. Mr. Fu, you’re a gentleman. Even if you wish to get engaged, you should have asked the lady about her feelings instead of deciding it with her family. After all, this is no longer the era of arranged marriages.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan spoke respectfully in a soft, yet firm, tone. Her words were direct with no embellishments. Even as she praised Fu Huai’an as a gentleman, it was merely to flatter him and emphasize his position as a man of character.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked at Lin Nuan without much emotion. His cold, thin lips were pursed, and he ignored her words, saying, “I lack a woman, Tuan Tuan lacks a mother, I don’t care who Gu Hanyan’s heart belongs to.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan suddenly remembered the little boy who looked at her with his big wet eyes as he shyly called her ‘Mother’.</p> <p>Her palms were covered in a thin layer of sweat, and her heart skipped a beat for a moment; she actually felt that Fu Huai’an’s words were a hint towards her.</p> <p>Distracted, Lin Nuan watched as Fu Huai’an brushed past her shoulder.</p> <p>Inside the bedroom, Fu Huai’an lit up a cigarette and casually threw his customized lighter onto the coffee table.</p> <p>Thud thud thud—</p> <p>Hearing the knocking on his door, Fu Huai’an picked up his cup of coffee with the same hand holding his cigarette, his deep gaze looking up in the direction of the door. He stayed silent.</p> <p>The results came faster than Fu Huai’an predicted.</p> <p>Thud thud thud—</p> <p>The knocking sound started up once more. Fu Huai’an’s long fingers ran along the rim of the cup, and he let out a low hum before he spoke up in a relaxed tone, “Enter…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s deep voice traveled beyond the door, and Lin Nuan’s heart clenched for a split second. Confusion and cowardice almost clouded her heart, but at the thought of Wen Moshen… His name was like a talisman, deflecting away her hesitation.</p> <p>Lin Nuan grabbed the door handle, turned it and entered the room.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an sat on the couch lazily, a document lying on his casually crossed legs.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan entered, Fu Huai’an was placing down the coffee in his hands, flipping onto the next page of the document with a cigarette in his mouth.</p> <p>She closed the door, her expression reflecting the desire to seek death.</p> <p>“Any problems?” Fu Huai’an didn’t turn his head; he calmly asked the question while biting onto his cigarette.</p> <p>In the room filled with cigarette smoke, Fu Huai’an’s expression was slightly obscured.</p> <p>“Mr. Fu, you said you need a woman, and Tuan Tuan needs a mother. I think that no matter if it’s being Tuan Tuan’s mother or being your woman, maybe I’m much more suitable than Gu Hanyan!” The rims of Lin Nuan’s eyes were red, and her tone was unfriendly. “You’re waiting for me to say this, right?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an stayed silent, his eyelids slightly closed. Through the white smoke, his strong facial features were blurred.</p> <p>If Fu Huai’an didn’t like Gu Hanyan, then Lin Nuan’s outstanding looks could easily gain favor from men. On the matter of being Tuan Tuan’s mother, Tuan Tuan had already taken Lin Nuan as his mother, hadn’t he?</p> <p>Lin Nuan wasn’t dumb to the point that she couldn’t get Lin Huai’an’s hint.</p> <p>Even though Lin Nuan had already decided on this plan beforehand, but after hearing Fu Huai’an’s hint, her heart was filled with indignation and anger.</p>",
  "Chapter 4: You Must Let Me See Your Sincerity": "<p>Her back was leaning firmly against the door, like a small kitten that was angered but had no choice except to resist getting angry.</p> <p>Underneath his thick brows, Fu Huai’an’s eyes narrowed slightly. His Adam’s apple moved imperceptibly as he slowly tapped away the cigarette ashes and said, “From how Tuan Tuan calls you Mom, you’re indeed more suitable than Gu Hanyan. Miss Lin may be pretty, and I also like Miss Lin, but it’s not necessary for this position to be filled by Miss Lin. If Miss Lin is unwilling, no one will force you. You should return to your room, get some rest, and pretend none of this happened.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s ears heated up, internally labeling Fu Huai’an as a beast dressed up as a human. He had made things clear, making her angry and embarrassed.</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood for a while instead of leaving, so Fu Huai’an patted the space beside him, motioning for Lin Nuan to sit there.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t move. Fu Huai’an’s deep gaze focused on her, reading the emotions in her eyes that she couldn’t quite hide. It made her remember her purpose in coming here, so she could only adjust her feelings and walked towards him.</p> <p>At the age of 25, when she started heading towards her 30s, Lin Nuan knew she would be responsible for her own actions.</p> <p>Since walking out of the guest room, walking into the door, saying all those words, Lin Nuan knew she had two choices: either she kept her pride and walked out , or she let go of her dignity and stayed to plead, letting Fu Huai’an get what he wanted</p> <p>They were both adults. Despite being a virgin, Lin Nuan knew that when a man and a woman were together alone in a bedroom—and in the middle of the night—it all brought to mind inappropriate images.</p> <p>Lin Nuan wore a set of men’s pajamas that had a too-wide collar. Her fair and slender neck, her prominent collarbones, were all completely exposed, giving a sensual impression.</p> <p>Her skin was too fair. At the moment, her slightly pinkish skin and reddened eyes were enough for anyone to know her internal struggle.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was exceptionally patient today—he watched Lin Nuan without any anxiety.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was having an internal war.</p> <p>Ultimately, her dignity was defeated by Gu Hanyan’s words—she didn’t want Wen Moshen to return only to find out that he had nothing left.</p> <p>Lin Nuan clenched her fists and stood firm beside the coffee table instead of sitting next to Fu Huai’an on the couch like he asked….</p> <p>Lin Nuan herself, was a proud and reserved lady.</p> <p>Going to find Fu Huai’an was a kind of submission that went against her heart, and was already challenging her limits.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, we’re both adults. Since you chose not to leave but walked over here instead… We both know what that means, so you should show me your sincerity instead of acting like I’ve wronged you…” Fu Huai’an’s voice was still deep and calm.</p> <p>Sincerity…</p> <p>Lin Nuan understood what Fu Huai’an meant by sincerity, and her face burned furiously.</p> <p>As though she’d used up all of the courage in her life, Lin Nuan walked closer to Fu Huai’an and sat down beside him…</p> <p>In between her breaths, all she could smell was Fu Huai’an’s masculine scent mixed with the smell of cigarettes. His presence was steady and calm, filled with a strong sense of pressure.</p> <p>The term cautious was definitely accurate when describing the present Lin Nuan.</p> <p>She lowered her eyes. Even though she clearly made a move to get closer, her body maintained a distance from Fu Huai’an, trying hard to make herself look natural.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an removed the sizzling cigarette from his mouth and held it in his hand. He placed his hand on the couch behind Lin Nuan while his body tilted towards her.</p> <p>The fresh smell of the man’s soap mixed with the scent of cigarettes infiltrated Lin Nuan’s nose, the heavy masculine fragrance made Lin Nuan nervous.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was very close to Lin Nuan—his increasingly heavy breaths caused Lin Nuan to panic, and her heart thundered against her chest.</p> <p>“Didn’t wear your bra… Mm?</p> <p>Fu Huai’an cocked a brow, his intense gaze was searing. His thick and deep voice that was slightly hoarse sounded sensual and pleasing to the ear, but the contents of his words turned Lin Nuan into an embarrassed mess.</p> <p>Lin Nuan flushed from head to toe. Yes… she didn’t wear it.</p> <p>Because she understood Fu Huai’an’s hint, she came up with the idea of unwillingly giving up her own body, taking the choice to retreat out of her hands.</p> <p>A woman wearing a man’s pajamas, bare inside and sitting on his couch—Fu Huai’an should understand the ‘sincerity’.</p> <p>She was so embarrassed she couldn’t face Fu Huai’an’s deep gaze. When she felt his breaths coming nearer, she nervously gripped a corner of her shirt with reddened eyes.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan…” Fu Huai’an’s lips sensually grazed her ears, and Lin Nuan immediately felt a tingle rush down her spine, her body tightening up as her ears became flushed.</p>",
  "Chapter 5: First Kiss?": "<p>Fu Huai’an softly called her name; Lin Nuan avoided Fu Huai’an’s mischievous lips at her ear to look up at him.</p> <p>His breath drew closer, mixed with the scent of minty cigarettes. Lin Nuan instinctively held her breath and turned her head away, exposing her fair neck.</p> <p>Their lips brushed against each other but did not kiss.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s eyes turned red—she was so embarrassed she wanted to cry.</p> <p>How had she gotten herself into such a position, where she could only let others do whatever they wanted to her?</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, it’s not my thing to force women. If you feel mistreated, you can return to the guest room…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was in more control of his lust compared to a young lady like Lin Nuan. As he spoke, he removed his hand that was still holding the cigarette from behind her, recovering his image as a proper gentleman.</p> <p>Lin Nuan loosened her grip on the corner of her shirt, her heart feeling relieved yet disappointed at the same time.</p> <p>Since she wanted to give up her body, why must she still feel wronged and act like the kind of woman who would choose suicide over losing their virginity? Lin Nuan felt disdain for herself.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an seemed to have let the matter rest. Lin Nuan warned herself that at that point, she should let go of her dignity and take the initiative.</p> <p>She couldn’t do anything else, but she had enough courage to kiss Fu Huai’an of her own accord..</p> <p>Her small hands clenched into fists, and she turned her head sideways to look into Fu Huai’an’s eyes. With a brave expression, she placed her arms around Fu Huai’an’s neck and gently kissed the corner of his lips.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an remained as still as a mountain.</p> <p>He wasn’t anxious—he’d always had plenty of patience towards Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan thought that Fu Huai’an was keeping his distance from her because of the unwillingness on her face.</p> <p>But Lin Nuan was unable to go further…</p> <p>Lin Nuan was a conservative woman. At her age, there had been many who wooed her, yet she had never dated anyone.</p> <p>In the Lin family, Lin Nuan had a fiancé, but the number of times they’d eaten a meal together in one year could easily be counted with her fingers. Even if they stayed together, it was merely out of obligation for their families.</p> <p>Intimacy was something they never had.</p> <p>Thus, even if Lin Nuan rehearsed it to perfection inside her heart, she was still helpless when it came to the “actual war” that relied purely on her taking the initiative. Her stiff muscles quickly started to ache.</p> <p>“Does kissing count as taking the initiative?” Lin Nuan asked.</p> <p>Her sweaty fists tightened. Seeing no reply from Fu Huai’an, she started to think about retreating.</p> <p>“Since you love Wen Moshen, why are you choosing to climb into my bed?”</p> <p>Upon hearing these words, Lin Nuan raised her eyes…</p> <p>Their gazes met; Fu Huai’an’s deep eyes were calm.</p> <p>Nothing could be hidden from Fu Huai’an’s gaze. Based on how perceptive he was, when she asked him to break off his engagement to Gu Hanyan, Fu Huai’an must have already known that she loved Wen Moshen.</p> <p>After laying it out so clearly, her feelings of being wronged became embarrassment from being exposed, and she said, “Because I can’t watch Wen Moshen’s woman get engaged to you.”</p> <p>“Sacrificing yourself for love?” Holding his cigarette in his mouth, Fu Huai’an crossed his long legs. Through the light smoke, he narrowed his eyes… He looked at Lin Nuan’s slender arms wrapped around his neck and felt slightly touched—to think that she could love someone to such an extent…</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t want to think of that dirty trade as something great. She despised it from the bottom of her heart, believing that there should be no mention of love in the matter because it only stained its meaning.</p> <p>“You call that a kiss?</p> <p>With the cigarette in his mouth, Fu Huai’an’s words sounded slightly unintelligible.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face flushed red; she had never kissed anyone before…</p> <p>It was as though Fu Huai’an could read minds—he immediately understood Lin Nuan’s thoughts and asked, “First kiss?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s palms hurt from how hard she was clenching her fists, and she straightened her neck to look at him. She stubbornly refused to admit her loss and looked like a little lady complaining about being bullied by the fake gentleman Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>She was the one with the request, so she put away her thorns, but she still unintentionally pricked others.</p> <p>“Truly a clean woman!” Fu Huai’an let out a puff of thin smoke and casually extinguished the cigarette. He gently rubbed his thumb that smelled of cigarettes against the corner of Lin Nuan’s lips. His Adam’s apple bobbed slightly, deep voice sounding especially sexy, as he said, “Let me teach you what it means to kiss.”</p> <p>The man’s tall and broad figure leaned over with a burning heat, his strong scent and aura infiltrating Lin Nuan’s heart and making her whole body tremble.</p>",
  "Chapter 6: He Calmly Accepts": "<p>Fu Huai’an held the back of Lin Nuan’s head with one hand, his warm lips pressing down. With a gentle kiss, he slowly pried open her lips and their soft tongues mingled together, sharing a light and minty cigarette smell…</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s breath was snatched away by the man, and her face flushed.</p> <p>As she felt nervous, Lin Nuan’s senses had become extremely sensitive—that kind of fluid exchange made her anxious to the point she felt her scalp turning numb.</p> <p>His aggressive breathing attacked Lin Nuan, making her panic.</p> <p>Her mind was all jumbled up, and her heart violently beat against her chest.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s kiss pushed an unfamiliar tingle up Lin Nuan’s stiff spine, making her uneasy and even causing her to feel fear…</p> <p>Before she came into the room, she’d thought it would be a battle where she would welcome her death, but her body was like putty in Fu Huai’an’s embrace. She had no way of rivaling Fu Huai’an’s experienced ways—she was clearly surrendering before the fight even started.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s partially-closed eyes took in the sight of Lin Nuan’s red face… Her eyes were unfocused as his large hands stroked the beautiful curve of her back. He pulled her closer to him, the softness under his touch filling him with desire.</p> <p>She had always been the woman Fu Huai’an wanted. She was helplessly pliant for him and unable to resist whatever he wished to do—how could he not be stirred up?</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s heart retained a sliver of consciousness as she struggled to resist, her small hands pressing onto Fu Huai’an’s chest. Under her palms, she felt Fu Huai’an’s skin, burning at a high temperature.</p> <p>The force behind Lin Nuan’s push was weak, but Fu Huai’an noticed her rejection and let go of her lips, breathing heavily.</p> <p>“Regretting it? Fu Huai’an asked.</p> <p>Two words and Lin Nuan subconsciously grabbed onto the fabric covering Fu Huai’an’s chest.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s attitude was clear; he did not force women. And as for lust… Lin Nuan was tasting it for the first time, but Fu Huai’an still appeared clear-headed enough to withdraw himself at any time, as though nothing had happened.</p> <p>She was afraid that it would happen—and afraid that it would not happen.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had forced herself into a dead-end. Her eyes reddened, and she lowered her head in silence.</p> <p>Did Fu Huai’an’s actions meant that he agreed to her replacing Gu Hanyan…</p> <p>Or… Lin Nuan had gifted herself to him, so he was calmly accepting it?</p> <p>Lin Nuan wanted to ask, but her sense of shame did not allow her to.</p> <p>“Don’t be nervous…” Fu Huai’an patiently comforted and coaxed her, his heavy breath sweeping across Lin Nuan’s lips. His sexy, hoarse voice comforted Lin Nuan’s uneasy and conflicted feelings.</p> <p>The sound of Fu Huai’an’s gentle voice right next to her ears inflamed her, and she tightly held onto his shirt to avoid having her body crumbling under him.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Nuan had a dream. In the dream… Wen Moshen came back.</p> <p>Right at the front door of the Lin family’s house, he wore the suit he’d had on the day he left, his face smiling in that way Lin Nuan was most familiar with. He was thanking Lin Nuan… Thanking Lin Nuan for helping him defend the woman he loved.</p> <p>The wind was strong, blowing to the point where Lin Nuan couldn’t even hide her tears. She was smiling… but her heart hurt as though someone had cut off a large piece, and it was turning cold.</p> <p>She remained where she stood and sent Wen Moshen away with her eyes, seeing him set off to find the woman he loved deeply with a blissful look on his face…</p> <p>The sound of a shower reached her ears, and Lin Nuan slowly woke up.</p> <p>Unfamiliar bedroom, unfamiliar bed… The unfamiliar pillow was soaked with Lin Nuan’s tears.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was showering in the bathroom; Lin Nuan sat up… looking at the mess of clothes on the floor, she didn’t know how she’d ended up with Fu Huai’an last night.</p> <p>Maybe it was his experienced ways that made Lin Nuan unable to resist, or maybe… maybe it was Lin Nuan’s stubbornness in loving Wen Moshen that gave her incredible courage.</p> <p>Lin Nuan got off the bed trembling, picking up the pajamas that didn’t belong to her and wrapped herself up firmly.</p> <p>At first, she wanted to take advantage of Fu Huai’an’s time in the shower to escape the crime scene, but she remembered that she hadn’t gotten a confirmation on whether he would give up his engagement with Gu Hanyan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan chose not to leave after some hesitation…</p> <p>Since it had already happened, why should she be scared to face it?</p> <p>…</p> <p>When Fu Huai’an came out of the shower, Lin Nuan had already tidied up the bed.</p> <p>Seeing Fu Huai’an, with his towel hung on his neck, she wanted to open her mouth but found it hard to speak.</p> <p>She heard the sound of a lighter, then Fu Huai’an asking, “Did Gu Hanyan look for you?”</p>",
  "Chapter 7: Give You A Present": "<p>Lin Nuan thought about last night. Perhaps Fu Huai’an had already seen them together, so she didn’t try to cover it up and nodded her head.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an walked to the window and said to Lin Nuan, “Come here…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan turned to look at him standing beside the floor-to-ceiling window and decided to walk over. Stopping next to Fu Huai’an, she looked up at him and eventually said, “You won’t force Gu Hanyan anymore, right?”</p> <p>After one night, Lin Nuan no longer spoke so politely to Fu Huai’an—it was a big improvement to Fu Huai’an who smiled at the change.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s black eyes were focused on a certain place outside the window as he reached out to pull Lin Nuan into his embrace.</p> <p>Shocked, Lin Nuan looked up to see Fu Huai’an’s hand gripping her shoulder, not knowing the reason behind his sudden move.</p> <p>“Do you see the white Passat on the right?” Fu Huai’an’s magnetic voice entered Lin Nuan’s ears, grazing her with his hot breath.</p> <p>Feeling embarrassed, Lin Nuan’s ears flushed red as she looked out the window to the right.</p> <p>“Gu Hanyan already had people watching you,” Fu Huai’an spoke calmly and without a care.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hands curled up, her face carrying awkwardness from having her weakness exposed, but she stubbornly insisted, saying, “I know…”</p> <p>Gu Hanyan was probably waiting for photos showing her and Fu Huai’an leaving the house together in the morning. With photos—with proof—then once Gu Hanyan blew the matter up, she would have enough reason and the higher ground to not marry Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>But Gu Huanyan never once considered Lin Nuan’s position.</p> <p>Asking from others then attempting to trap them, that method of handling things was indeed despicable.</p> <p>But… as long as Gu Hanyan was doing it for Wen Moshen, Lin Nuan would endure it.</p> <p>Since she had already reached that step, Lin Nuan suddenly gained the courage to ask, “Mr. Fu… Can I replace Gu Hanyan now?”</p> <p>“How do you wish to replace her…” Fu Huai’an didn’t let go of Lin Nuan’s shoulder.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was an unsmiling man, yet at that moment he smiled at Lin Nuan, his dark eyes revealing an unreadable deepness as the golden morning light shone on them.</p> <p>“As Gu Hanyan wishes, or properly?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an gave Lin Nuan the option to choose.</p> <p>For a woman like Lin Nuan who had such outstanding looks, no matter which man she stood with, she would still attract others.</p> <p>That was exactly what Gu Hanyan wanted to make use of.</p> <p>But Lin Nuan disliked how Gu Hanyan handled matters…</p> <p>Currently, Lin Nuan was still a child of the Lin family by name.</p> <p>Lin Nuan who had always followed the rules and became the model of a proper lady from a recognized family… If a scandal came out relating to her snatching away someone else’s fiancé, how could she face her parents who raised her?</p> <p>These were all matters that Gu Hanyan had never considered for Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Even before Fu Huai’an gave her the choice, Lin Nuan had never thought about herself.</p> <p>Since Gu Hanyan’s request had already been accomplished, why must Lin Nuan continue along the path that Gu Hanyan had arranged?</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s gaze remained fixed on the Passat as her lips parted, and she said, “Properly.”</p> <p>The corner of Fu Huai’an’s lips lifted up further, and he said, “Let me give you a present…”</p> <p>“Huh? Lin Nuan let out a sound of puzzlement.</p> <p>“Since you don’t wish to see Wen Moshen’s beloved woman marry other people, then I will let Wen Moshen’s woman be unable to marry anyone else from now on. She can just wait obediently for Wen Moshen.”</p> <p>What kind of present was that?</p> <p>Lin Nuan speculated with some meanness that it probably stemmed from the need to avenge his self-esteem as a man.</p> <p>Lin Nuan watched as Fu Huai’an turned around, removing his bathrobe to change his clothes. She turned back in a panic, then covered her awkwardness with a slight cough and said, “I’ll go back to the guest room first.”</p> <p>Just as Lin Nuan opened the door, she saw Auntie Li carrying a sleepy Tuan Tuan out of his room.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was wearing one-piece pajamas with a cartoon bear theme. While clinging onto Auntie Li’s shoulder, the bear-shaped hood covered his small head. His small face, fair and soft, rested on Auntie Li’s shoulder, his right chubby cheek pressing down.</p>",
  "Chapter 8: Sit Beside Mama!": "<p>Early in the morning, Lin Nuan, coming out from the master bedroom as a guest… Even being seen by Auntie Li as well. It was indeed embarrassing.</p> <p>Lin Nuan gave a flustered smile, but before she could open her mouth to greet Auntie Li, Tuan Tuan’s’ previously sleepy eyes opened—really wide.</p> <p>He suddenly straightened his tiny back with excitement, and his watery eyes sparkled as he shouted, “Mama!”</p> <p>Even though she had already heard Tuan Tuan call her that many times, Lin Nuan still wasn’t used to it…</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan frozen on the spot, Tuan Tuan climbed down from Auntie Li using all four limbs, then ran cutely towards her… Like a little bear cub.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan had grown smarter—he didn’t hug Lin Nuan out of nowhere like he did last time. He knew that if he did, he would scare his Mama.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan simply stood at Lin Nuan’s feet, raising his head to stare longingly at Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was a very pretty little boy; his features were completely unlike Fu Huai’an’s. Tuan Tuan’s eyes were round and big, black and bright, unlike Fu Huai’an’s dark and long narrow eyes.</p> <p>The little boy standing in front of Lin Nuan had softer facial features… Delicate and adorable just like a little lady!</p> <p>Lin Nuan guessed that Tuan Tuan was probably more like his mother.</p> <p>“Uh… have you eaten breakfast?” Lin Nuan asked.</p> <p>Lacking experience interacting with children, Lin Nuan’s voice was dry and awkward. Facing a kid that called her Mama made Lin Nuan panic more than when she was interacting with Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan obediently shook his head.</p> <p>“Miss Lin, you can accompany Tuan Tuan to go and eat, breakfast is already prepared…” Auntie Li smiled as she spoke.</p> <p>Auntie Li had been taking care of Tuan Tuan for years, yet she had never seen Tuan Tuan’s mother.</p> <p>Ever since Tuan Tuan met Lin Nuan, he had firmly called her his mother, leading Auntie Li to have some suspicions. After seeing Lin Nuan come out from Fu Huai’an’s room today, in her heart, Auntie Li believed more firmly that Lin Nuan was Tuan Tuan’s mother.</p> <p>“Then… let’s go!” Lin Nuan said to Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>“En!” Tuan Tuan nodded his head furiously.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan didn’t dare to grab Lin Nuan’s hand, so he walked quickly beside her instead.</p> <p>While heading down the stairs, Lin Nuan reached out her fair hand to Tuan Tuan, causing his eyes to shine even more. He originally wanted to place his small hand onto Lin Nuan’s palm, but he was afraid that she would reject him… So he carefully held onto Lin Nuan’s index finger, grabbing it tightly with his warm fist. He looked up and smiled sweetly at her.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan had never felt so blissful. Papa said… Mama was the most beautiful person on Earth. Yes… His mother was the most beautiful person he had ever seen. Even her fingers were so pretty, exactly like his!</p> <p>Downstairs, at the dining table.</p> <p>Auntie Li was just about to place Tuan Tuan in his high chair, but he ran to Lin Nuan’s side. With his two chubby arms—one hand pressed onto the chair while the other held onto the edge of the table—he raised his legs to climb the chair with some effort and obediently sat next to Lin Nuan. He then placed both hands on his thighs in a well-behaved manner. He looked up at Lin Nuan who was pulling her chair out to sit down, just like a little pug cub trying to please its owner.</p> <p>Auntie Li smiled at the sight and asked in a gentle voice, “Does Tuan Tuan want to sit next to Miss Lin?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nodded his head hard and said, “En… Sit beside Mama!”</p> <p>Regarding being called Mama, Lin Nuan still wasn’t used to it…</p> <p>She had already reached a consensus with Fu Huai’an. She couldn’t deny it, yet she couldn’t accept it immediately. The corner of her lips lifted into an awkward smile.</p> <p>“Then… Tuan Tuan’s breakfast, I’ll bring it over to you…” said Auntie Li, whose smile grew increasingly bright.</p> <p>“En!” Tuan Tuan nodded his head.</p> <p>Lin Nuan sat down next to Tuan Tuan and watched him…</p>",
  "Chapter 9: In Haicheng… Everyone Knows": "<p>Auntie Li brought over Tuan Tuan’s nutritious breakfast and placed it in front of him. The dining table was too tall for Tuan Tuan—even if he used his hands to hold onto the edge of the table, he could barely peek over it.</p> <p>Lin Nuan passed the cup of milk to Tuan Tuan. He held the cup close to him and quickly finished the milk before turning to look at Lin Nuan with his bright and sparkling eyes.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan didn’t talk much, and he kept staring at Lin Nuan… as though he was afraid that once he started talking he would scare her away.</p> <p>Lin Nuan took the empty cup away from Tuan Tuan’s hands and picked up a bowl with a steamed egg.</p> <p>The bowl holding the egg was rather hot, so Lin Nuan didn’t pass it directly to Tuan Tuan. Instead, she picked up a spoon, picked up a spoonful, and passed it to Tuan Tuan’s mouth.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was both surprised and nervous as he stretched his neck to take a bite. His chubby hand held tightly onto the table’s edge as he ate up the food Lin Nuan fed him in small mouthfuls.</p> <p>When Fu Huai’an came down the stairs, that scene was what he saw.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan, who wasn’t as high as the table, sat closely next to Lin Nuan. With both hands holding onto the table, he happily raised his head, waiting for Lin Nuan to feed him.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an buttoned up his sleeves as he calmly walked down the stairs.</p> <p>“Sir…” Auntie Li greeted Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an sat down. In order not to disturb the “family of three” eating their breakfast together in peace, Auntie Li retreated silently.</p> <p>“Papa!” Tuan Tuan happily called for Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s expression remained normal as he pulled out a chair to sit down. Picking up the newspaper Auntie Li left on the dining table, he calmly started reading, as though the scene happening in front of him was normal, and he was used to it.</p> <p>“This afternoon at four I’ll make a trip to the Lins and officially meet your parents. That way we can get the marriage certificate tomorrow morning. I’m going on an overseas business trip tomorrow night, and Auntie Li has something to settle at her house so she’ll be taking leave starting this afternoon. These few days while I’m overseas, I’ll leave it to you to take care of Tuan Tuan.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s voice was neutral, and he arranged everything within a few sentences, clearly not giving Lin Nuan any room to object.</p> <p>Upon the mention of the Lin family, Lin Nuan paused in the middle of feeding Tuan Tuan his egg soup.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan opened his mouth but saw that Lin Nuan wasn’t passing him the egg soup. He didn’t complain; he only raised his head to look at Lin Nuan obediently.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s gaze never moved away from the newspaper, his voice calm as he said, “Your passport is still at the Lin household. If we want to get our marriage certificate, it’s unavoidable to visit the Lins.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked at Fu Huai’an’s profile and asked, “You investigated me?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an gazed deeply at Lin Nuan and replied, “Haicheng… It’s not a secret here. Everyone knows about it.”</p> <p>Indeed, the people of Haicheng all knew.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was once a model lady of a known rich family, but she then became a fake lady everyone pitied.</p> <p>Everyone in Haicheng knew about Lin Nuan parents; a birth mother who was mentally ill and a selfish birth father.</p> <p>That year, Haicheng had an earthquake and the Lin family accidentally lost track of their newborn daughter. Father Lin thought that his daughter was already dead, but Mother Lin was unwilling to give up and kept searching.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s birth mother gave birth to her daughter on the same day as Mrs. Lin. At the time of the incident, when Lin Nuan’s birth father rescued his own daughter from the baby shower room, he also rescued the little baby girl beside her.</p> <p>After three months, the Lin family finally found the couple that rescued their daughter. That couple was Lin Nuan’s birth parents.</p> <p>The Lin family felt extremely grateful for Lin Nuan’s birth parents and took back their daughter. Who would’ve thought that Lin Nuan’s birth father would send his own daughter to the Lins to let her live a wealthy life, while he kept the Lin family’s real daughter to suffer in poverty with them?</p>",
  "Chapter 10: Troubled on Both Ends": "<p>The fake lady who was wrongfully raised by the Lins for more than twenty years—once the real daughter of the Lins returned, her original position in the Lin family became extremely awkward. Furthermore, the ones who caused it were her birth parents.</p> <p>Mother Lin was unable to completely let go of the Lin Nuan whom she’d taken care of for over twenty years, but she also couldn’t ignore her birth daughter. So, on the one hand, she continued to care for Lin Nuan, and on the other, she tried to think of ways to make it up to her birth daughter, feeling troubled on both ends.</p> <p>But Lin Nuan knew what she had to do in that tough situation—the day the real daughter of the Lins returned, she found an excuse to move out of the Lin family’s home.</p> <p>After moving out, Mother Lin still came by often to give Lin Nuan good clothes and good food, but the Lin family’s house… Lin Nuan had never once returned.</p> <p>If Fu Huai’an was going to visit the Lins for his marriage with Lin Nuan, she would be frowned upon if she didn’t return with him.</p> <p>Lin Nuan originally wanted to ask Fu Huai’an whether he knew that her birth mother had a mental illness?</p> <p>Before she could open her mouth, Lin Nuan felt a warmth at the tip of her finger. When she looked down, she saw Tuan Tuan’s soft hand holding onto her.</p> <p>Children are sensitive—Tuan Tuan sensed Lin Nuan’s mood change and felt a little scared…</p> <p>Meeting Tuan Tuan’s bright black eyes, Lin Nuan forced down the words at the tip of her tongue and replied, “I know. Call me before you go, and I’ll… go there too.”</p> <p>After breakfast, Fu Huai’an left for the lawyer’s office, and Lin Nuan got ready to head for the radio station.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an had already dealt with the parked car near his house in the morning.</p> <p>Lin Nuan said she wanted it to be proper, so Fu Huai’an would definitely grant her wish.</p> <p>However, Auntie Li was taking a break in the afternoon, and Fu Huai’an had already left. Lin Nuan looked at Tuan Tuan who was sitting across from her, quietly staring at her with his big eyes. For a moment… Lin Nuan didn’t know what to do.</p> <p>She glanced at her wristwatch; it was almost 1 p.m. and she’d promised her colleague to help her cover the 1:30 p.m. radio program today. She couldn’t delay going to work anymore.</p> <p>After some pondering, Lin Nuan changed into her clothes—which Auntie Li had already washed and ironed—and brought Tuan Tuan with her to the radio station.</p> <p>…</p> <p>When Lin Nuan suddenly brought such a cute little boy to the radio station building, it attracted many adults into coming over to take a look.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan obediently sat on the couch, holding the cotton candy that Lin Nuan bought for him along the way. As he hugged the numerous snacks that Lin Nuan’s colleagues pushed onto him, he looked up at the crowd of uncles and aunties asking him endless questions. He looked adorable, like a cute little baby straight out of a comic.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s good friend Bai Xiaonian sat inside the broadcasting room and watched the chubby Tuan Tuan through the glass window. She too was cooing over the boy’s cuteness and desperately wanted to go out and squeeze Tuan Tuan’s tiny face.</p> <p>After Bai Xiaonian tested the mic, she took off her headphones and leaned towards Lin Nuan, asking, “Nuan Nuan, where did you get such a cute baby from? He’s way too precious!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan took a look at Tuan Tuan, and for a moment she couldn’t answer; she couldn’t possibly just tell Bai Xiaonian the truth, right?</p> <p>“Hey, I’m asking you a question.”</p> <p>Getting no response from Lin Nuan, Bai Xiaonian elbowed her lightly.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian was not a gossipy person, and she wasn’t someone who felt strong curiosity towards anything. However, Bai Xiaonian had been friends with Lin Nuan for more than ten years—she knew that Lin Nuan was in a difficult situation. She was afraid that Lin Nuan’s kindness would inadvertently bring some messy problems for herself.</p> <p>Lin Nuan glanced at the clock in the broadcasting room and replied, “I’ll tell you later after the program…”</p>",
  "Chapter 11: Don’t Lose Yourself to Money": "<p>The show began on time.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan put down the snacks in his hand and leaped off the sofa. He ran across the room to watch Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian through the transparent glass.</p> <p>“What splendid weather we have today—it’s raining cats and dogs! Yet ’tis the season of harvest, so my wife took leave from work to return home and harvest the wheat. So this noon, at the hour of ” Wandering in New York”, Nuan Nuan and I will be accompanying you.”</p> <p>Once the show began, Bai Xiaonian began teasing her partner that took leave.</p> <p>“A good afternoon to everyone! In this misty and cold weather, thank goodness Nuan Nuan is here to accompany you. Not cold, but warm—warm like my name, like 999 cough syrup, heating you folks up.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian’s show was supposed to be a light-hearted and funny one. Lin Nuan got into the zone pretty fast. Her self-deprecating humor even elicited a few heartfelt laughs from the phone editors outside.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian laughed out loud. “Woah! The advertisers must be very pleased to have their advertisement put on the show!”</p> <p>“Looks like this is the advertiser funding your show; I’m literally sacrificing myself to serve you,” Lin Nuan commented with a smirk in her eyes.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan stared at Lin Nuan without blinking. It was the first time he noticed that Lin Nuan had a funny side to her. He envied that Bai Xiaonian sitting beside her; he wished his mother would smile at him like that.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian noticed Tuan Tuan standing at the door peeking inside, his tiny hand pressed up against the glass. He was so tiny and petite, his clear beautiful eyes following Lin Nuan wherever she went, melting people’s hearts at the sight of him.</p> <p>“Wow, there are already comments left from Wei Bo’s friends…” Bai Xiaonian quickly resumed her work mode and read out loud in a light, bright tone, “<em>‘What a pleasant surprise, my Goddess Nuan actually came on this show!’ </em>And you, with your username “The Birdbrain Boss”, what’s your comment supposed to mean? Are you saying our show is low class? Nuan Nuan is without a doubt a ‘Ten’, but so am I… I’m half a ‘Ten’. Nuan Nuan, please do us some justice and kindly tell this classmate how sophisticated our show really is.”</p> <p>“Hmm….” Lin Nuan pretended to think deeply. “When I was entering the studio I overheard you chatting with my editor about me coming on the show. Ye Ye said that I must be out of my mind to come on a whimsical show like this, just to tear down my image.”</p> <p>“Well, Ye Ye… looks like you’ve lost your big raise for this month!” Bai Xiaonian joked as she laughed out loud.</p> <p>Behind the glass window, they saw Ye Ye stick out her tongue.</p> <p>“From how I see it, you should give me the big raise. After all, my image did get ruined after being on such a nonsensical show.”</p> <p>“May Goddess Nuan mind your cockiness—don’t lose yourself to money.” Bai Xiaonian and Lin Nuan continued to tease each other.</p> <p>Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian had a great rapport as partners, owing to the strong friendship they sustained over the years.</p> <p>The hour-long program finally came to an end. Lin Nuan said goodbye to their audience and made a date with them for the following evening at six, reminding them to listen to her own show. Afterward, Bai Xiaonian told her, “That kid… he stood at the door for almost an hour looking at you.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked up.</p> <p>As expected, Tuan Tuan was standing at the door, staring at her with his huge eyes.</p> <p>Lin Nuan removed her earpiece, got up and walked out of the room.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan looked up at Lin Nuan. He wanted to get closer to her, but he was still a bit apprehensive, so all he could do was offer a big sweet smile.</p> <p>In that instant, Lin Nuan felt sorry for the child who’d lost his mother—he was too young.</p> <p>Even though Lin Nuan wasn’t related to the Lin family by blood, she had truly been happy before she found out the truth.</p>",
  "Chapter 12: This Child Is Particularly Close to You": "<p>In the Lin Family, Lin Nuan’s mother had been utterly protective of her, to the extent that she had been literally sheltered like a delicate princess.</p> <p>Lin Nuan bent down and lifted Tuan Tuan up by his tiny little elbows, nestling him in her arms.</p> <p>She pondered what to do with him if she was going to go to the Lin Family that afternoon.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an might not trust anybody else to look after him. Otherwise, Bai Xiaonian could be a good candidate to take care of Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>However, the matter definitely needed to be discussed with Fu Huai’an before she could ask Bai Xiaonian for her help.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was a bright kid. He could remember Fu Huai’an’s phone number quite clearly. In fact, he managed to recite both of his numbers when Lin Nuan asked him.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian finished tidying up and took a look at the adorable pudding in Lin Nuan’s arms. She asked, “What’s the deal with this kid?”</p> <p>“Help me look after him for a bit, I need to make a call…” Lin Nuan looked at Tuan Tuan and said, “Stay with Aunt Bai for a while, okay?”</p> <p>“Don’t call me Aunt Bai.” Bai Xiaonian took Tuan Tuan into her arms and shamelessly brainwashed him. “Call me Sister.”</p> <p>“….” Lin Nuan was speechless.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian took Tuan Tuan into the pantry to get something nice to eat while Lin Nuan walked into the stairway and called Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan told him about the situation, Fu Huai’an asked, “So where’s Tuan Tuan now?”</p> <p>“Tuan Tuan is with my friend,” Lin Nuan replied.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was taken by surprise. Tuan Tuan had an odd personality—he usually wasn’t willing to stay around strangers.</p> <p><em>“Maybe he’s doing it to suck up to Lin Nuan?”</em></p> <p>Fu Huai’an inwardly let out a sigh. Tuan Tuan really did want Lin Nuan as a mother…</p> <p>“If you’re going to the Lins, I can pick you up at the radio station. I’ll hand Tuan Tuan over to my assistant who can babysit him for us.”</p> <p><em>“So he was unwilling to let someone else look after Tuan Tuan,” </em>Lin Nuan thought. She agreed. “Okay. Then what time are you coming to pick me up, Mr. Fu?”</p> <p>“Three-twenty.”</p> <p>He answered without hesitation.</p> <p>“Very well. I’ll be waiting for you downstairs with Tuan Tuan at three-twenty.”</p> <p>“Sure.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an hung up the phone after giving a succinct response.</p> <p>Lin Nuan returned to the room and saw Tuan Tuan’s chubby, fair face surrounded by the station’s employees. No matter how hard they tried to tease him, he wouldn’t say a word.</p> <p>As soon as he saw Lin Nuan come in, Tuan Tuan leaped off the seat and ran towards her. He stopped himself short half a meter away to look up at her. His huge, innocent eyes radiated a spark reserved only for her.</p> <p>Lin Nuan found the cautiousness in his movements to be genuinely endearing.</p> <p>She bent over and caressed his tiny head, “Father will pick us up at three-twenty. Hey, I know an awesome ice-cream shop downstairs, how about we go get ourselves some ice cream before he gets here?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan grinned like a Cheshire cat. He nodded furiously. “Yes!”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian walked towards Tuan Tuan and said, “This kid seems particularly close to you.”</p> <p>Even though Tuan Tuan didn’t say anything, his behavior raised some suspicions regarding his relationship with Nuan Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s reputation was already pretty bad at that point. As soon as Bai Xiaonian said that, it was a silent explanation to the crowd that there wasn’t much going on between the child and Lin Nuan.</p> <p>…</p> <p>The ice-cream shop was right downstairs.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan sat in a chair a tad higher than himself, holding the ice-cream bowl in one of his chubby hands while vigorously shoving spoonfuls of ice cream into his mouth with the other.</p>",
  "Chapter 13: A Marriage With Fu Huai’an?": "<p>Tuan Tuan saw the kid opposite their table splattering his face with ice-cream, his mother chuckling and wiping it off the corner of her little sweetheart’s mouth—his heart ached with longing at the scene.</p> <p>He took a peek at Lin Nuan and felt a sinking feeling inside… he, too, had ice cream splattered all over his face.</p> <p>When Tuan Tuan dropped his head to take another scoop of ice cream, a soft, slender finger suddenly grasped his head.</p> <p>He looked up and saw Lin Nuan wipe his mouth gently with a handkerchief.</p> <p>“Eat slower… look at the mess on your face.” Lin Nuan’s voice sounded so lovely, just like the first time he heard it on the radio station. It was so soft—soft enough to make people feel fuzzy inside.</p> <p>“Okay!” Tuan Tuan nodded. But he didn’t want to eat slower. He liked the way Lin Nuan gently wiped the corner of his mouth when he made a huge mess on his face. It felt like he was being lovingly adored by a mother.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian sat across Lin Nuan and Tuan Tuan, chewing on her straw. She crossed her long, slender legs, a troubled expression written all over her face.</p> <p>“Are you really… going to marry Fu Huai’an?” Bai Xiaonian felt Lin Nuan’s decision was too rash.</p> <p>Lin Nuan nodded.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian knew Lin Nuan was smart. She was sure that Lin Nuan knew that Gu Hanyan was just using her, but she was actually willing to let herself be used for Wen Moshen.</p> <p>“But what about your happiness?” Bai Xiaonian asked again, “And what about that dignified fiancé the Lin Family arranged for you?”</p> <p>“That was the fiancé they prepared for a daughter of the Lin family. Their legitimate daughters should be the ones marrying into the Gu Family—”</p> <p>Lin Nuan stopped herself mid-speech.</p> <p>Of course, the Gu Family wasn’t going to let a woman with a mentally disabled mother marry their only son.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian knew Lin Nuan all too well. The real reason was that Lin Nuan had no feelings towards the young Sir from the Gu Family. If she did, she wouldn’t have managed to say all that so nonchalantly.</p> <p>“Is it all worth it then… just for Wen Moshen?” Bai Xiaonian asked, her beautiful eyebrows furrowing together. Obviously, she thought it wasn’t.</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked down and chuckled. “Even if it was, I still owe Moshen’s brother. Maybe he won’t hold a grudge anymore after this?”</p> <p>“Just keep lying to yourself.” Bai Xiaonian sighed.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s head fell as she let out a faint laugh, a blank expression covering her face.</p> <p>Out of all people, how could Bai Xiaonian not be aware of Lin Nuan’s gratitude towards Wen Moshen?</p> <p>Yet it wasn’t Lin Nuan lying to herself. After all, it was her final warning to herself. She felt it was time to let go—let go of her past with Wen Moshen.</p> <p>At exactly three-twenty, Lin Nuan’s phone rang. Fu Huai’an was calling.</p> <p>“I need to go…” Lin Nuan grabbed her purse and glanced at Tuan Tuan who had already finished his ice-cream. “Tuan Tuan, let’s go. Your father is here.”</p> <p>“Okay!” Tuan Tuan nodded.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian sat in the ice-cream shop, watching as Lin Nuan walked towards the black Bentley parked on the roadside, Tuan Tuan nestled in her arms.</p> <p>Under the sunlight, Fu Huai’an stood at the rear end of the car, his lips biting a cigarette. He stood there in his navy fitted suit, the top unbuttoned, revealing the white, neatly ironed shirt underneath. He didn’t wear a tie.</p> <p>His mannerisms exuded the sophistication and intellect of a cultivated alpha male, intimidating people at mere sight.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian crossed her feet and rested her chin on her hand. She had to admit Fu Huai’an, and Lin Nuan looked like a great match.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian had heard about Fu Huai’an. He was notoriously cold, especially towards women. So many of them had attempted to approach him upon hearing about his power in the lawyer world, yet they all received terrible ends.</p> <p>But why did Gu Hanyan turn down Fu Huai’an, a man with such credentials who was willing to marry her, and instead turned to Lin Nuan to ask for help?</p>",
  "Chapter 14: So You’re Willing to Come Back Now?": "<p>Bai Xiaonian would never believe that Gu Hanyan was waiting for Wen Moshen.</p> <p>A woman like Gu Hanyan knows exactly what she wants.</p> <p>She wasn’t Lin Nuan… and she definitely wouldn’t reserve herself for a man almost confirmed dead.</p> <p>Gu Hanyan’s act of devotion in front of Lin Nuan was merely to manipulate her love for Wen Moshen!</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian knew that even if Lin Nuan saw through it, she wouldn’t do anything about it.</p> <p>Wen Moshen had always been Lin Nuan’s weak spot.</p> <p>…</p> <p>As Fu Huai’an’s car reached the gates of the Lins’ mansion. Lin Nuan suddenly made his assistant park the car near the road.</p> <p>Lin Nuan turned and said to Fu Huai’an, “If I don’t say anything in advance to the Lin Family and just break the news that we’re getting married, my mother won’t be able to accept it. How about I go in first to lay some groundwork, then you can come in? I only need twenty minutes…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan talked it over with Fu Huai’an. After all, as a busy, influential figure in the lawyer world, his time was valuable.</p> <p>To her surprise, Fu Huai’an nodded.</p> <p>Lin Nuan thanked him, took her purse and alighted from the car.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, she looked at the imposing black gates of the Lin Mansion.</p> <p>It was where she grew up. It all seemed so familiar, yet so distant.</p> <p>Before Lin Nuan could muster up the courage to walk up to the door and ring the doorbell, a car approached her from the side.</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan…”</p> <p>The driver seat’s window rolled down, revealing Lin Chen’s face.</p> <p>After the truth was revealed—that Lin Nuan wasn’t kin to the Lins—Lin Nuan was unwilling to see anyone else from the Lin Family besides her mother. The last time she saw Lin Chen was actually four years ago.</p> <p>Lin Chen got down from the car. He was still handsome and elegant like he was four years ago, but with an extra touch of maturity.</p> <p>Lin Chen was wearing a white shirt with a wide collar and a gray vest, and he looked quite exceptional. Perhaps the Lin Family was too busy that period, but his eyes were full of sleepiness. The moment he saw Lin Nan, it felt as if he’d entered a different world. He felt a gentle ache somewhere at the bottom of his heart.</p> <p>He still remembered the scene when Lin Nuan left the mansion with her luggage. She stood at the bottom of the staircase—he stood at the top—when she said, “Brother, if you still consider me as your sister, then don’t ever come to see me again. The same goes for everyone else in the Lin family. It would just feel like my heart got stabbed with a knife.”</p> <p>Because of that sentence, Lin Chen had visited her house so many times, but he would just sit in his car, anticipating the moment he could see her rushing back home from work.</p> <p>Lin Chen was unaware of how four years could change a person. He just felt Lin Chen grew slimmer, her delicate face as pale as a sheet.</p> <p>“Brother…” Lin Nuan unconsciously called out, her eyes watering and her nose turning red.</p> <p>Lin Chen stood in front of her with his slender, long legs, a scent of tobacco lingering on him…</p> <p>“So you’re willing to come back now?” Lin Chen fought back the lump in his throat and asked in a heavy voice.</p> <p>Lin Nuan tightened her grasp on her purse, the bitterness surging through her heart. She looked up at him with a pained expression, trying to suppress her emotions.</p> <p>The sun was shining on her face; the mist beneath her eyes dampened her long eyelashes. Lin Nuan looked down and said, “I brought home my fiancé to introduce to Mother…”</p>",
  "Chapter 15: It’s Either Me… or Her!": "<p>Lin Chen’s clenched his fists in his pants pockets. His long, bony fingers inadvertently let out a cracking sound. He immediately unclenched his fists, maintaining the calm composure in his enigmatic eyes. Smoothly concealing his emotions, he took the box of cigarettes out of his pocket.</p> <p>“Your fiance? Gu Shaoting?” Lin Chen pulled out a cigarette and bit onto it as he searched for a lighter on his body.</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head.</p> <p>Thinking about the man in the car still waiting for her, Lin Nuan knew that she only had about twenty minutes. Seeing that Lin Chen hadn’t found his lighter yet, she said, “Brother, let’s talk about it after we go inside. Let’s not stand outside…”</p> <p>Lin Chen stared at Lin Nuan in silence and removed the cigarette from his mouth. He just wanted to spend a little more time alone with Lin Nuan. But he lost his composure once he heard that Lin Nuan had brought home her… fiancé.</p> <p>“Come in…”</p> <p>Lin Chen honked the horn, and the gates of the Lins’ mansion slowly opened.</p> <p>Lin Chen drove all the way inside along their driveway and made a call back home. The butler picked up.</p> <p>Lin Chen broke the news that Lin Nuan had returned.</p> <p>The news set off an uproar in the Lin Family. Especially to Lin Ran, who was picking out a formal dress for her grandmother’s birthday celebration next month.</p> <p>There was no way that Lin Ran could treat her decently; not the woman who’d robbed her identity for so many years.</p> <p>“What’s she here for?” Lin Ran said with furrowed brows, feeling her anger rising inside like steam.</p> <p>Liang Mulan took a look at Lin Ran and held her small hand tightly. Her eyes began to water.</p> <p>She wanted to thoroughly persuade Lin Ran to accept Lin Nuan. Deep down, Liang Mulan still wanted Lin Nuan to come back home—even if it meant becoming a part of the family using another identity.</p> <p>Liang Mu Lan pleaded, “Ran Ran, please bear with it… for me. You need to know that both you and Nuan Nuan are children to me, I really—”</p> <p>“Mother, you have only one daughter. It’s either me… or her! If you want Lin Nuan to come back to play as your daughter, then I’ll leave! Think it over!”</p> <p>Lin Ran slammed the magazine on the table and stormed upstairs.</p> <p>“Ran Ran…” Liang Mulan called out as she stood up. Lin Ran didn’t turn back.</p> <p>Lin Ran fought back her tears. She was the illegitimate daughter of the Lins, not Lin Nuan! After wandering around from home for so many years, everyone should have cherished and loved her like a gem the moment she came back!</p> <p>But the brothers always reserved a cold attitude towards her, as if her arrival had broken the harmony of their family.</p> <p>Every single day, the only thing that elderly woman talked about was how she’d brought up Lin Nuan. When Lin Nuan was still in the Lin Family, all the socialites had tried to emulate her. Lin Ran should learn a bit more from her if she didn’t want to ruin the image of the Lins outside the family.</p> <p>As if Lin Ran didn’t hear the servants gossiping about her behind her back, saying that she came from a humble background. Despite being a blood-related daughter of the Lin Family, she couldn’t compete with Lin Nuan in terms of etiquette and elegance—she was the girl who was raised in the Lin Family since she was a child.</p> <p>For so many years the mere mention of Lin Nuan’s name was like a sharp knife that stabbed her in the heart. The moment anyone pressed on it, the blood just kept dripping—and it hurt like hell.</p> <p>Lin Ran hated Lin Nuan and her real parents… so much so that she wished she could tear them into pieces.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Chen parked his car in place. Lin Nuan unbuckled her seatbelt and prepared to get off the car.</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan, have you considered that matter Mother mentioned when she visited you?” Lin Chen turned and looked at the beautiful curves of her side profile. He intentionally lowered his tone so she wouldn’t detect the tremor in his voice.</p> <p>Lin Nuan grabbed the handle of the car door and turned back to look at him…</p>",
  "Chapter 16: What Right Did She Have to Look Down on Fu Huai’An?": "<p>Lin Chen gazed deeply into her eyes.</p> <p>It required considerable courage from Lin Chen to say what he just did.</p> <p>Previously Liang Mulan had informed Lin Nuan that if she didn’t like Sir Gu from the Gu family, perhaps she could consider being with Lin Chen. Then everyone could be from the same family, and Lin Nuan would be her daughter, just…. by another identity.</p> <p>At that time, Lin Nuan assumed it was merely Liang Mulan’s wishful thinking since she was too protective of her.</p> <p>But hearing Lin Chen ask that very question, Lin Nuan felt genuinely startled.</p> <p>“We’ve lived together for so long as a family. We have the same habits, we know everything about each other…” As Lin Chen took his time to persuade her in his deep voice, Lin Nuan noticed he was hiding something behind his expression.</p> <p>“Brother…” Lin Nuan fell silent for a moment. “You don’t have to do this for Mother…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t know the right words to say in that situation—she never rehearsed beforehand in her heart. With a lump in her throat, she couldn’t utter a single word.</p> <p>Lin Chen’s gaze grew even more serious. He didn’t look one bit like he was joking, only calm and determined.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s fluttering heart began to settle down. She replied, “Brother, I know you and Mother both have the same plan—to make me a member of the Lin Family. But you need to know that even though we aren’t related by blood, I’ve always seen Mother as my own mother, and you as my real brother. I… wouldn’t change that for anything in the world.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was smart—she always was. And she made a perfect point.</p> <p>“If that’s the case, why won’t you come home? Hm?” Lin Chen tried to repress a flash of anger from his voice.</p> <p>“Because… it’s awkward,” Lin Nuan replied honestly, “Facing Lin Ran… It’s even more awkward.”</p> <p>The kind of awkwardness that felt terrifying…</p> <p>Without waiting for Lin Chen to reply, Lin Nuan put on an indifferent tone, “Brother, you definitely won’t imagine who I brought home to marry—it’s Fu Huai’an! Did you know, he’s got quite a reputation in the lawyer world.”</p> <p>Lin Chen couldn’t maintain a composed expression anymore. His eyebrows slowly knitted together.</p> <p>Since Lin Nuan was so eager to reveal the person she was marrying, it was evident to Lin Chen; she was determined to make it clear that she objected to marrying him.</p> <p><em>“Well, Fu Huai’an has a reputation that exceeds more than just the lawyer world, doesn’t he?”</em></p> <p>Fu Huai’an had kept a low profile for a whole year. Three years ago he suddenly appeared on Wall Street in America as a lawyer. His transformational business tactics left people in awe. Some predicted that he would come to control Wall Street in no longer than a year’s time, which had caused quite the commotion.</p> <p>When he returned to his homeland with his son, he stopped taking cases, leaving all lawyer-related matters to his partners to settle while he himself delved into high-risk investments. Nearly all the new trending projects in recent years were funded by him.</p> <p>Lin Chen recalled a commentary on Fu Huai’an written in the Economy Times. The passage elaborated considerably on Fu Huai’an’s adroit and fiercely accurate vision. Even Lin Chen had to admit it; he possessed a cunning intellect.</p> <p><em>“So Lin Nuan’s actually going to marry Fu Huai’an of all people?”</em></p> <p>A man with a child…</p> <p>Lin Chen’s forehead began to wrinkle like a raisin. How on earth did Lin Nuan come to know a man like Fu Huai’an?</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan, this man already has a kid,” Lin Chen said with pure anger written all over his face.</p> <p>Lin Nuan gave a faint laugh. ” And my own mother has a mental illness.”</p> <p>Her implication was that Fu Huai’an had never looked down on her, so what right did she have to look down on Fu Huai’an?</p> <p>Lin Chen really wanted to explain that he didn’t mind her having a mentally disabled mother. In fact, nobody in his family would ever look down on Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Of course… except for Lin Ran.</p> <p>However, Lin Nuan had already made it very clear that she saw Lin Chen as a brother—and nothing more.</p>",
  "Chapter 17: You Have an Engagement With the Gu Family": "<p>“Didn’t he already confirm his engagement with Gu Han?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s slender fingers tightened their grasp on her purse. She answered calmly, “It’s nothing but a rumor…”</p> <p>“How long have you known each other?”</p> <p>Lin Chen put in a lot of effort to make himself sound like a big brother.</p> <p>“Three or four months…” Lin Nuan answered honestly.</p> <p>Lin Chen began to heat up with anger. Lin Nuan was going to marry a man she had known for only three or four months? She was being too impulsive!</p> <p>“Do you understand what you’re doing?”</p> <p>As soon as Lin Chen finished his sentence, Liang Mulan had walked out of the mansion’s entrance.</p> <p>Liang Mulan fixed her shawl, her eyes focused on Lin Chen’s car, and she walked towards them briskly.</p> <p>“Mother is coming…” Lin Nuan said as she opens the door and exits the carriage.</p> <p>Liang Mulan had already spotted Lin Nuan from afar. Her eyes teared up, and she couldn’t help but quicken her steps.</p> <p>“Mother…” Lin Nuan called gently.</p> <p>Lin Chen looked down as he lit up a cigarette. He unbuckled his seatbelt and left the car unhurriedly.</p> <p>“Nuanuan….” Liang Mulan reached forward to grab Lin Nuan’s petite hand. She exclaimed in an accusatory yet relieved tone, “You’ve finally come back home?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan grinned and immediately got to the point, “I brought back the man I’m marrying so I can introduce him to Mother. We’re going to collect our marriage certificate tomorrow.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s news caught Liang Mulan off guard. She took a look at Lin Chen who just alighted from the car with a cigarette in his mouth. Liang Mulan grasped Lin Nuan’s petite hand tightly and said, “Follow me upstairs.”</p> <p>Liang Mulan was still acting like a mother in front of Lin Nuan—old habits died hard.</p> <p>Liang Mulan almost dragged Lin Nuan into her bedroom.</p> <p>Closing the door, Liang Mulan forced Lin Nuan to sit on the sofa and interrogated, ” Are you rushing to marry some random man… just because I told you to consider marrying your brother?”</p> <p>Liang Mulan had obviously misunderstood…</p> <p>She was afraid that the ridiculous idea she proposed—as a result of her fixation on Lin Nuan returning to the Lin Family—had prompted Lin Nuan to panic and find some random person to marry. Such a decision could lead to the biggest mistake of her life.</p> <p>Liang Mulan scolded her, “You foolish child! If you’re not willing, then it’s fine with me… Do you think I would ever force you to do it? I only thought of that messed up idea because I hoped it would get you to come back home! You can’t act recklessly just because you don’t agree with me! Aren’t you stabbing your mother in the heart right now?”</p> <p>Liang Mulan couldn’t hide the desperation and care in her eyes; it was a mother’s most raw affection towards her daughter.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s eyes grew red. She was truly grateful towards Liang Mulan. Even after the brutal truth had been revealed, she still treated her as her own daughter.</p> <p>“Mother…” Lin Nuan took Liang Mulan’s hand, her voice choked with emotion.</p> <p>Liang Mulan wiped away the tears in her eyes and wrapped her arms around Lin Nuan. She made a futile attempt to hold back from crying.</p> <p>Liang Mulan’s voice was hoarse as well, “Even if you aren’t my own flesh and blood, I did raise you since you were a child. All I ever wanted was for the person you married to treat you properly. That way you can truly be happy. I think I messed up there—I actually came up with an idea that ridiculous to keep you by my side… Alright, my dear. Don’t worry, I won’t mention it again. You still have an engagement with the Gu Family, and as long as your father and I are here, the Gu Family won’t dare to break it off. But you’d better promise me you won’t keep up this recklessness outside! Otherwise, I won’t be able to take it…”</p> <p>Outside the bedroom door, Lin Ran silently listened to their heartfelt conversation. Her whole body ached as if she’d been thrown into a meat grinder, crushed into pieces.</p> <p>Lin Ran was Liang Mulan’s real flesh and blood, but as long as Lin Nuan was here, she was treated like some kid she picked up from the streets?!</p>",
  "Chapter 18: It Was That Simple?": "<p>Liang Mulan was well aware that Lin Ran liked Gu Shaoting. In fact, she had told Liang Mulan herself!</p> <p>She had wholeheartedly believed that if the Lins were to marry into the Gu Family, a daughter from the Lin family would be appropriate. After she began to develop feelings towards Gu Shaoting, Lin Ran naturally saw herself as his fiancée. And… Liang Muran had given what rightfully belonged to her—the engagement—to Lin Nuan?!</p> <p>On what basis?</p> <p>Lin Ran’s fingers coiled from the intensity of her seething fury.</p> <p>She turned around to quickly leave. Yet as soon as she reached the staircase, she suddenly stopped and stood still.</p> <p>Why should she be the one leaving? She’s the one who belongs to the Lin Family! She wasn’t intimidated by Lin Nuan. So in what universe did she have to leave inside her own territory?</p> <p>Lin Nuan finally managed to calm down Liang Mulan. She told her that the man she was marrying was waiting right outside and that her only agenda today was to bring him back home to meet her. Liang Mulan finally stopped crying…</p> <p>Liang Mulan wiped the tears away from the corners of her eyes with her already damp handkerchief. With furrowed eyebrows, she said in frustration, “Why didn’t you say so earlier? Look at my ruined makeup—how on earth am I presentable now?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan laughed gently. “No matter what, you still look beautiful.”</p> <p>The mother and daughter seemed to have returned to their former intimacy. It was the first time Lin Nuan said something flattering and playful to Liang Mulan after she had left home.</p> <p>The guest had already reached the door. It was better not to keep Fu Huai’an waiting outside.</p> <p>Liang Mulan didn’t ask any more about her fiancé. She urged Lin Nuan to invite him inside.</p> <p>Lin Nuan came out of the room and saw Lin Ran standing nearby with arms folded, as if she were waiting for her.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, oh wait… that’s not right. I should be calling you, Lu Nuan?” Lin Ran said mockingly, her tone cold and sarcastic.</p> <p>Lin Nuan actually understood how she felt. In Lin Ran’s eyes, Lin Nuan was merely a thief, stealing the life that had always belonged to her.</p> <p>Lin Ran had always felt that if the Lin Family had raised her, she would definitely outshine Lin Nuan—instead of being mocked behind her back as a hillbilly who came from an unknown place.</p> <p>As they stared at each other, Lin Nuan’s gaze was much gentler and calmer in nature.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt very apologetic towards Lin Ran. She said, “My identity card is still here in the Lin Family’s home. I returned today just to retrieve it so I can collect my marriage certificate. If you don’t want to see me again, I won’t ever come back.”</p> <p>Lin Ran clenched her fists. In that instant, her nerves were on edge, and her body shook slightly as she asked, “Your marriage certificate…? With who? Gu Shaoting?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head and apologized, “I’ve always wanted to apologize to you. I’m the one who stole twenty years of the life that belonged to you.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s voice was clear, sincere, and soft. These few words stunned Lin Ran on the spot.</p> <p>She probably didn’t expect Lin Nuan to apologize, since it wasn’t even her fault in the first place.</p> <p>The fault… lied with Lin Nuan’s real parents.</p> <p>Lin Ran cleared her throat as she steadily approached Lin Nuan, lowering her voice to say, “Since you feel sorry and you know… that you stole a life that didn’t belong to you for so many years, then please stay away from my home… and my family. Especially my mother.”</p> <p>Lin Ran was trying to assert her power here, but her eyes ended up watering. She was basically a child, afraid that her own family was being robbed away.</p> <p>She never was a cunning nor manipulative person by nature. To say something stern like that only revealed how unsettled she was inside.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt a piercing pain from the bottom of her heart. To avoid complicating things between Liang Mulan and her real daughter, she nodded.</p> <p>“Very well…” Lin Nuan agreed to Lin Ran solemnly. “After I collect that certificate, I’ll cut all ties with the Lin Family for good.”</p> <p>It was that simple?</p> <p>Lin Ran was silently shaking inside.</p>",
  "Chapter 19: A Long-Term Strategy": "<p>She didn’t expect Lin Nuan to agree so readily.</p> <p>By right, a dynasty like the Lin Family should be one that Lin Nuan would never want to leave. In fact, she should be grasping onto her mother for any opportunity to stay.</p> <p>Lin Ran even saw Lin Nuan’s departure that year as a long-term strategy. She was retreating for the sake of advancing.</p> <p>“What game are you trying to play now?” Lin Ran narrowed her eyes, sizing Lin Nuan up defensively.</p> <p>Without waiting for Lin Nuan’s response, Lin Ran looked at Lin Nuan as if she had suddenly reached a grand enlightenment, “So you do want to marry Lin Chen! You want to get back into the Lin Family this way? Oh, Lin Nuan… after living with Lin Chen as brother and sister for twenty years, you actually came up with such an indecent idea…”</p> <p>“Lin Ran!”</p> <p>A deep voice called out from behind Lin Ran.</p> <p>An indecent idea…</p> <p>It insulted both Liang Mulan and Lin Chen, not just Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Ran straightened up stiffly before turning back to look at Lin Chen.</p> <p>Lin Chen’s tall figure was standing by the staircase, his hands in the pockets of his pants that covered his long, slender legs. He glanced towards Lin Ran with a piercing coldness and with repressed anger in his features—his presence was thoroughly intimidating.</p> <p>“No matter when or where Lin Nuan will forever be a part of this family. Nobody can change that.”</p> <p>Lin Chen’s imposing presence left Lin Ran somewhat cowed. That was the first time she’d seen Lin Chen with such a grim look on his face. She bit her lip, not daring to respond back.</p> <p>“My fiancé is still outside. I’ll go invite him inside first.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan said matter-of-factly and went downstairs, brushing shoulders with Lin Chen.</p> <p>Lin Chen stood there watching Lin Nuan’s figure disappear downstairs. The veins in his clenched fists began to pop as he fixed his gaze on Lin Ran.</p> <p>“You’re a part of this family, but so is Lin Nuan…” Lin Chen said in a heavy tone, “I think that Father and Mother just wanted to see the two of you get along like sisters.”</p> <p>“I—”</p> <p>“Even if you can’t manage to do that, there’s no need to be that cruel.”</p> <p>Lin Chen didn’t even give Lin Ran the chance to reply.</p> <p>Lin Ran stood there completely mute, her face drained of color. She had always respected and somewhat feared her big brother Lin Chen.</p> <p>And after hearing such harsh feedback coming from him, Lin Ran couldn’t hold back her tears.</p> <p>“If this family didn’t want to welcome me, you shouldn’t have let me come back in the first place!” Lin Ran cried as she ran back to her room, slamming the door shut.</p> <p>Liang Mulan heard the commotion and came out of her room. She saw Lin Chen standing at the staircase and asked, “What’s the matter?”</p> <p>“Baby Ran is throwing a tantrum at me…” Lin Chen answered blankly.</p> <p>Liang Mulan knew it was because Lin Nuan had come back.</p> <p>“Baby Chen, Ran Ran…”</p> <p>“Mother, you don’t need to explain, I get it,” Lin Chen interrupted her and glanced at his watch, “I need to go.”</p> <p>“Baby Chen, Nuan Nuan brought back her fiancé—check him out for me.”</p> <p>Liang Mulan was somewhat nervous. When a daughter brought her fiance back home for ‘inspection’, that was always the case.</p> <p>“I just came home to copy a document. There’s still a meeting in the office, so I have to leave first…”</p> <p>Lin Chen concealed his sentiments well within his deep eyes. He had always been a composed and unpredictable man. Even his own mother and his father sometimes felt distant from their son.</p> <p>When Lin Chen came downstairs, he spotted Lin Nuan in the living room making a phone call to Fu Huai’an, her back facing him. Lin Chen took a long glance at her slender, tall figure, and left the mansion without a word. Standing outside the front door, he lit up a cigarette.</p>",
  "Chapter 20: What Lin Nuan Said to Fu Huai’an": "<p>Lin Chen’s sharp and defined features were enveloped in the swirling smoke. His mood was very complicated. He gazed into the far distance as he fell into deep contemplation.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had always been an exceptional sister to Lin Chen, and he was fiercely protective of her from the bottom of his heart.</p> <p>Yet at some point, the protectiveness changed in nature—Lin Chen himself was unaware of it.</p> <p>When Liang Mulan approached Lin Chen and proposed the idea of having Lin Nuan marry him to get her to return home, Lin Chen felt something stirring in his still heart.</p> <p>And that tiny hint of sentiment terrified Lin Chen.</p> <p>No matter what, Lin Nuan was his sister—she had been for twenty years.</p> <p>Liang Mulan’s plan made Lin Chen realize that he had feelings for his own sister; feelings that transcended more than just familial love.</p> <p>Lin Chen, however, had never focused on nor invested in romance.</p> <p>His job was his sole priority. He always believed he was going to marry a woman that would ultimately benefit the Lin Family. She didn’t need to excel in looks nor abilities, as long as she was willing to settle down and do her job.</p> <p>Evidently, Liang Mulan’s words had kindled certain feelings in his heart.</p> <p>Without finishing his cigarette, Lin Chen saw the large black iron gates of the Lin Family slowly open, letting in a black Bentley.</p> <p>Lin Chen bit the cigarette with the corner of his mouth, fixed his suit and glanced at the car through the smoke with narrowed eyes.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an…</p> <p>They say that he was a monster, and his name set people trembling in the lawyer world. There wasn’t a case he couldn’t crack, even if there was clear-cut evidence on the table. He always had a solution.</p> <p>After going undercover for three years, he stopped taking cases, no matter the price offered. Instead, he began to make a name for himself on Wall Street.</p> <p>After Fu Huai’an returned to his homeland, the Jiang Family suddenly announced they were bankrupt before anyone could comprehend the situation. There were outside speculations that it was Fu Huai’an’s handiwork. After all, he was the legitimate son of Jiang Chengyuan—the CEO of the Jiang Cooperation. He crushed the Jiang cooperation to avenge his mother.</p> <p>Even a man as proud as Lin Chen had to admit, Fu Huai’an could do whatever he wanted and get away with it. Everything he touched turned into gold. Effortlessly.</p> <p>Lin Chen mumbled Fu Huai’an’s name in his heart…</p> <p>Upon hearing Lin Nuan’s approaching footsteps, Lin Chen put out his cigarette in the pot next to the door and leisurely walked towards his car.</p> <p>Lin Chen was already in his car by the time Lin Nuan walked out of the house.</p> <p>Through the glass window, he took one look at her standing in the sunset.</p> <p>The sun was blazingly bright after the rain. With her whole figure enveloped in a golden haze, Lin Nuan appeared like an angel caught between the clear sky and earth.</p> <p>Lin Nuan held her phone in one hand and flipped her hair behind her ear, the strands tangled from the wind. Her dark, hauntingly beautiful eyes gazed at the car approaching from the distance. She didn’t display the uneasiness or nervousness that a girl bringing home her boyfriend should have.</p> <p>After a long while, Lin Chen broke off his gaze and started the engine.</p> <p>Lin Chen and Fu Huai’an’s cars passed each other. Glancing into the rearview mirror, he spotted the tall figure alight from the car and stand before Lin Nuan. She looked up and said something to him…</p> <p>…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an sat in the European-styled sofa in the Lins’ living room. His refined features radiated a composed, unfathomable demeanor and a magnetic presence.</p> <p>From his appearance and demeanor to his mysterious background, Fu Huai’an was admittedly a man of considerable charm.</p> <p>At the age of thirty, he was already a man of authority and power, one that maintained a low yet wealthy profile. He was quite the man—ripe like fine wine while commanding an alpha male’s presence. Even a woman at Liang Mulan’s age would take one look and feel her heart skip a beat, let alone a girl like Lin Nuan who had barely set foot into society and was as spotless as a sheet of paper.</p> <p>Liang Mulan observed Fu Huai’an’s mannerisms as he raised his cup and sipped his tea. She couldn’t help but mirror his movements and take a sip of her own.</p> <p>The elegance in Liang Mulan’s composure emanated from her bones. Lin Nuan’s decorous gestures were jointly influenced and molded by Liang Mulan herself.</p>",
  "Chapter 21: The Speculations": "<p>“If I may ask, Mr. Fu… is this going to be your second marriage? Because you already have a son, unless…” Liang Mulan felt that she had to ask that difficult question for the sake of her daughter’s happiness.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked up, the calmness in his expression not changing one bit. He replied, “Since you are Lin Nuan’s mother, and I am marrying Lin Nuan, I should tell you the honest truth about the child. Tuan Tuan was a child who my friend asked me to take care of—before he passed away.</p> <p>It took Lin Nuan by surprise.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an didn’t say any more than he needed. Lin Nan guessed that Fu Huai’an didn’t want the child to think he was an orphan, so he took up the role of his father.</p> <p>Liang Mulan was also visibly shocked. Ever since Fu Huai’an had brought back a child, there were so many outside speculations…</p> <p>Some had theorized that Fu Huai’an had gotten married then divorced overseas, and brought back a child!</p> <p>The nastier rumors were that the child was born out of wedlock.</p> <p>An old wound caused by the death of a friend was not one Liang Mulan should reopen. She apologized and contemplated whether Fu Huai’an’s words were truthful. But there was no way she could see through his unfathomable eyes.</p> <p>It was the first time Fu Huai’an revealed Tuan Tuan’s background.</p> <p>It was an open gesture to Liang Mulan to prove his sincerity to marry Lin Nuan.</p> <p>“So are you aware of Nuan Nuan’s past?” Liang Mulan asked.</p> <p>Liang Mulan meant Lin Nuan’s family background. She wanted to know if Fu Huai’an knew about Lin Nuan’s mentally disabled mother and whether he considered it to be an issue like the Gu Family did.</p> <p>Four years ago, Lin Nuan’s life experienced a transformational change. Her real father visited her with Lin Ran out of the blue. After revealing the background of the two kids, he committed suicide by ingesting poison. Fu Huai’an knew all about it.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an said, “Yes. I know everything about Lin Nuan’s background and her real parents. Everything…”</p> <p>Liang Mulan gripped the teacup tightly in her hand. She looked into Fu Huai’an’s deep eyes and said, ” Nuan Nuan even told you about this.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an couldn’t deny it. Lin Nuan, however, felt uneasy since she had never lied to Liang Mulan even as a kid. Suddenly she had no choice but to play along.</p> <p>That afternoon, Liang Mulan discussed some trivial matters with Fu Huai’an. Fu Huai’an was an eloquent conversationalist and he composed himself well. Furthermore, he didn’t mind Lin Nuan’s background.</p> <p>Besides the fact that he had a child, he seemed flawless to Fu Huai’an—she even developed a certain fondness and appreciation towards him.</p> <p>She just found it hasty of them to collect the marriage certificate the very next day. However it was Lin Nuan’s choice of husband, and Liang Mulan had no right to prevent them from doing so.</p> <p>After sending off Fu Huai’an, Lin Nan left the Lins after retrieving her identity card.</p> <p>She felt a sense of relief as she sat inside the cab, watching the picturesque scenery outside through the window.</p> <p>Upon collecting the marriage certificate, she thought Liang Mulan would have nothing to say if she used the marriage as the reason to remove herself from the identity card…</p> <p>If she still kept her ties with the Lins it would be unfair to Lin Ran…</p> <p>But how could she abandon the true bond she had with the Lin parents and brother just like that?</p> <p>…</p> <p>That evening, Lin Nuan took a shower once she reached home. Once she came out, she saw a few missed calls on her phone.</p> <p>Lin Nuan returned the calls as soon as she realized it was her landlord’s number.</p> <p>The landlord called to negotiate with her on the rising rent—right after Lin Nuan had just paid the next installment.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s landlord was a lady from the south. Her voice was soothing and pleasant, yet there was a non-negotiable edge to her words.</p> <p>Lin Nuan paused for a while. Her eyes fell on the identity card under her table lamp.</p>",
  "Chapter 22: Lin Nuan Knew Better Than Anyone": "<p>Lin Nuan and Fu Huai’an were going to collect their marriage certificate the next day. Fu Huai’an’s intention was for her to look after Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>Then where was she supposed to stay—here or in Fu Huai’an’s home? She hadn’t thought it through before this.</p> <p>If she called Fu Huai’an right then to clarify the matter it would seem as if she were rushing into things.</p> <p>At the other end of the line, her landlord said in a soft voice, “I do like you—you keep such a tidy and comfy place. I can really trust you with my house. It’s just the inflation getting out of control and I still need to cover my costs. So think it through. Our contract will expire in two months. If you think the price is acceptable for you we’ll choose a date to extend it. Is that okay with you?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t think it was unreasonable for the landlord to raise the rent. She wasn’t going to raise it until the contract expired, and she expected to extend it and continue raising the price—yet Lin Nuan could still understand.</p> <p>It would indeed be more convenient for Lin Nuan to stay here since it was closer to the station.</p> <p>After Lin Nuan hung up the phone, she dug up the contract. Before she could take a closer look at it, her doorbell rang.</p> <p>Lin Nuan glanced at her watch. At nine-forty, the only person visiting her would be Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Without putting on a jacket, she opened the door in her nightgown, a towel strapped around her neck.</p> <p>A guy in a vest stood outside the door. He wasn’t too tall so it had been quite tiring for him to carry Bai Xiaonian on his back.</p> <p>He was silently taken aback at the sight of Lin Nuan’s thin clothing and her overly defined features.</p> <p>The strands of hair left on her face were not yet dry as the drops of water streamed down her beautiful cheeks. The droplets adhered to her smooth, white skin, her swan-like neck, and rested on her attractive collarbones.</p> <p>The aroma left from a fresh bath smelled so nice to him. He unconsciously averted his eyes, yet they couldn’t help falling on her long slender legs. His face turned even redder then when he first met Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>“Um… I’m the driver your friend called. She drank too much and nagged me to send her here…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan hadn’t expected to see a driver at the door. She instantly regretted opening the door in her current attire. Turning around to snatch the hoodie lying on her shoe shelf, she hurriedly slipped it on and kept a straight face. She then reached out to take Bai Xiaonian from his hands and said, “Thank you… leave it to me.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan knew better than anyone what Bai Xiaonian was like when she got drunk.</p> <p>The guy tried to support Bai Xiaonian while awkwardly maintaining some distance from her so she couldn’t take advantage of him. His movements were as awkward as they could be.</p> <p>Lin Nuan supported the hammered Bai Xiaonian with her right arm. Before the guy could loosen her left one, Bai Xiaonian lifted up her head.</p> <p>“Heh heh… Nuan Nuan…” Bai Xiaonian hooked the guy towards her with her left arm and pinched his face with her pretty and long fingers. Her speech was slurred as she mumbled, “Look at the tiny little bunny I caught today—isn’t he adorable?”</p> <p>“Ouch…” He was almost in tears from the pain.</p> <p>“…” Lin Nuan was speechless.</p> <p>How much did Bai Xiaonian drink to reach this state?</p> <p>“I’m so sorry. My friend always acts this way when she drinks too much…” Lin Nuan apologized as she forcefully peeled Bai Xiaonian off of the guy’s body.</p>",
  "Chapter 23: Tuan Tuan Was A Quiet Boy": "<p>“No problem! No problem! Well then… See you!”</p> <p>The red-faced driver let go of Bai Xiaonian and ran to the lift as though he was fleeing.</p> <p>Lin Nuan wasn’t short, and Bai Xiaonian wasn’t heavy… But once the driver let go, Lin Nuan struggled to support Bai Xiaonian who was leaning on her body, her whole back hitting the doorframe.</p> <p>“Ouch…” Lin Nuan inhaled sharply from the sudden pain.</p> <p>“Little Nuan Nuan… Why are you so beautiful? I thought I was pretty enough… But you’re prettier than me! You’ve almost made me gay, what should I do…”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian took the opportunity to press down on Lin Nuan, her slender fingers appearing out of nowhere in front of Lin Nuan’s chest; sadness overcame her heart and Bai Xiaonian drunkenly cried, “Say, Lu Jinbei that a**hole, why does he have to like big breasts?” Does he want to drink milk, always looking for big breasts…”</p> <p>Lu Jinbei was Bai Xiaonian’s boyfriend during university… First Love Lu Jinbei felt lonely during Year 4 so he cheated on Bai Xiaonian behind her back and got caught in the act.</p> <p>After the break up, Bai Xiaonian acted like nothing was wrong, but her heart couldn’t get over it —every time she drank, she could no longer hold it in and it became common for her to flirt around and to curse Lu Jinbei’s whole family and ancestry, sometimes even mumbling about wanting to give up her virginity.</p> <p>Ding—</p> <p>Hearing the sound of the lift, Lin Nuan’s brows drew tightly together… Not wanting others to witness the weird scene, she pulled away the hand Bai Xiaonian placed over her heart, saying, “Let’s go in, then we can talk…”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian held Lin Nuan’s neck with one hand and her other hand once again touched the softness of Lin Nuan’s chest, her coral red lips puckering up and inching towards Lin Nuan’s face…</p> <p>“My good Nuan Nuan, just be obedient and let me touch you… Apart from yours, where else can I get to touch such big breasts? Be good… Let this sister kiss you!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan avoided it with practiced familiarity and used her hand to block Bai Xiaonian’s mouth, coaxing Bai Xiaonian with furrowed brows, “We’ll see about that after we go inside.”</p> <p>Just as she was supporting Bai Xiaonian into her house, she saw Fu Huai’an standing at the doors of the lift… One hand carrying Tuan Tuan and the other in his pocket.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an wore a dark-colored shirt and suit, the dim lighting in the corridor making his figure appear broader and darker.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt her entire face flush crimson in just one second.</p> <p>“Mua mua mua mua… Little Nuan Nuan, don’t be shy, you should already be familiar with this.” Bai Xiaonian stubbornly pushed closer to Lin Nuan’s face.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s whole body was radiating with awkwardness.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s clear big eyes watched Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian, the innocence in his eyes inducing guilt in Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was afraid that Tuan Tuan would learn something bad so she covered Bai Xiaonian’s mouth without hesitation and dragged her into the house with an embarrassed face.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan finally got the noisy Bai Xiaonian settled onto her bed, there was already a thin layer of sweat on her body.</p> <p>She turned back and realized that Fu Huai’an had already entered with the child without being invited in.</p> <p>Currently, Tuan Tuan was standing at the bedroom door looking well-behaved, his clear eyes simply gazing at Lin Nuan without a sound, adorable to the point that it was heart-aching.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan wore a black hoodie and blue jeans; his white sports shoes were already removed. Because Lin Nuan had no slippers suitable for Tuan Tuan, his small feet walked on the floor covered only by his little white socks.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan’s gaze falling onto his small feet, Tuan Tuan felt shy and clumsily used his right foot to hide his left foot, almost losing his balance.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was a very quiet boy, unlike other kids his age… They were often noisy and talked non-stop.</p>",
  "Chapter 24: Lin Nuan Was Searching": "<p>Lin Nuan looked at Tuan Tuan and remembered that when Fu Huai’an was at the Lins’ house, he’d said that Tuan Tuan was a child of an old friend that he was looking after.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t have any experience with handling kids, so she was thinking of how to interact with Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>She raised her hand to tuck her wet hair behind her ear; just as she was about to speak to Tuan Tuan, she realized her throat was extremely dry.</p> <p>Clearing her throat, Lin Nuan walked in front of Tuan Tuan, licking her lips before saying, “That auntie… She drank too much.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t know if her way of explaining Bai Xiaonian’s actions would be understood by Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nodded his head.</p> <p>“When Tuan Tuan grows up, you shouldn’t learn from that auntie.”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s innocent eyes looked at Lin Nuan. But he wanted to copy that auntie—that way he could kiss and hug Mama.</p> <p>Seeing that Tuan Tuan wasn’t saying anything, Lin Nuan thought that Tuan Tuan was too young to understand so she didn’t say another word.</p> <p>She closed the bedroom door to let the drunken Bai Xiaonian take a good rest, while she picked up Tuan Tuan and carried him to the living room.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was currently sitting languidly with crossed legs on Lin Nuan’s couch, an unlit cigarette pressed between his long fingers; he held up the interview advertisement inside of the morning newspaper that Lin Nuan had left on the coffee table, together with the rental contract that Lin Nuan had yet to look through, his gaze deep and indifferent.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s rented apartment was not big; a two-room flat of 98 square meters, definitely big enough for a lady like Lin Nuan.</p> <p>But when Fu Huai’an sat there, the living room looked somewhat cramped.</p> <p>The warm light from the tall lamp shone onto the right side of Fu Huai’an’s face, tracing out his indifferent features and the stiff white collar of his shirt.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s thick broad shoulders covered half of the light from the lamp, giving Lin Nuan the impression that his mature and calm aura felt all the more intimidating.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an bit onto the cigarette from the corner of his lips and casually placed the interview notice onto the coffee table, looking at the apartment rental contract.</p> <p>Lin Nuan placed Tuan Tuan down and turned on the main lights in the living room.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an raised his head, looking up to see Lin Nuan and Tuan Tuan standing together. He then put down the contract papers and lit up the cigarette at the corner of his mouth.</p> <p>Lin Nuan watched Fu Huai’an silently, waiting for him to explain why he brought Tuan Tuan out at night and came to her house.</p> <p>But ultimately… Lin Nuan was defeated under Fu Huai’an’s deep gaze. Thinking back to Bai Xiaonian’s embarrassing actions earlier on, she spoke with a burning face, “My friend drank too much…”</p> <p>“Mm, I saw it and heard it…” Fu Huai’an’s thick voice sounded indifferent, and his tone was casual… It made Lin Nuan’s ears heat up.</p> <p>He saw it? And heard it?</p> <p>What did he see, and what did he hear?</p> <p>Lin Nuan remembered Bai Xiaonian shouting about her breasts being big, and then touching her body from head to toe… She felt awkward and embarrassed, but then saw the barely visible smile on Fu Huai’an’s lips and her embarrassment turned into anger.</p> <p>This man! The child was there too yet he didn’t try to evade the scene?</p> <p>Silence fell in the house once more and Tuan Tuan looked at his chubby hand held tightly in Lin Nuan’s. He happily looked up at Lin Nuan with his clear eyes, completely unaware of the strange silence between Fu Huai’an and Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s gaze dropped to meet Tuan Tuan’s, and her face grew redder…</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t think that Tuan Tuan was also laughing at her—children are too pure to think too much into these issues. After all, Fu Huai’an’s words were completely normal; it was her own heart that felt guilty so she flared up at Fu Huai’an’s words.</p>",
  "Chapter 25: Hungry?": "<p>Lin Nuan let herself calm down before asking, “What happened to make you bring the child over so late?”</p> <p>“Tuan Tuan wanted to come and see you…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked towards the little person standing beside her, all well-behaved and cute.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was afraid that Tuan Tuan’s feet would get cold from only wearing socks, so she picked him up again and placed him on the one-seater.</p> <p>She never had any male guests over so she didn’t have any slippers prepared for men. She found a pair of pink lady slippers for Tuan Tuan and placed them under his feet.</p> <p>The slippers were still too big for Tuan Tuan, but they would have to make do…</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s gaze followed Lin Nuan around, Seeing her bend down, a few strands of wet hair fell down from her forehead and he wanted to use his chubby hand to help Mama put it behind her ear, but he was afraid that it would be too sudden, so he spoke softly in his cute voice, “Mama, your hair…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan raised her eyes and smiled at Tuan Tuan, tucking her wet hair in and asked with a gentle look, “Do you want to drink some milk?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nodded happily.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s gaze wandered to Fu Huai’an’s feet and she realized that Fu Huai’an’s well-polished hand-made, Italian shoes were openly stepping on Lin Nuan’s light brown rug.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s mouth twitched—Fu Huai’an was worse than a child. Even Tuan Tuan knew that removing one’s shoes when entering someone else’s house was basic manners.</p> <p>“Mr. Fu, do you want tea or plain water? I don’t have any freshly ground coffee here…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan subconsciously felt that Fu Huai’an should be someone who was particular about the little details in life. He should prefer drinking freshly ground coffee—instant coffees were probably not up to his standard.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had plain water, as well as tea leaves that Liang Mulan had brought over previously. It should be acceptable for Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“Plain water…” Fu Huai’an spoke with indifference on his face.</p> <p>Lin Nuan turned to the kitchen to pour water for Fu Huai’an and milk for Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s short limbs pressed onto the sofa to launch his jump down. With the oversized women’s slippers hanging on his feet, he stumbled around behind Lin Nuan, looking as though he could trip over the slippers at any time.</p> <p>Lin Nuan got a shock, and she carried Tuan Tuan into the kitchen. Tuan Tuan felt so blissful that his ears turned red.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan opened the fridge, Tuan Tuan stood beside her legs and raised his head to watch her, the cold air from the fridge cooling his heated ears slightly.</p> <p>His big eyes were glued to Lin Nuan’s fridge—he felt a little hungry…</p> <p>Lin Nuan took out the milk and poured some into the small pot to heat it up for Tuan Tuan, before pouring a glass of water for Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“Grrroooowwlll…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan distinctively heard the sound of Tuan Tuan’s stomach rumbling. Tuan Tuan was instantly embarrassed, his small soft face turning hot.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan turn to look down at him, Tuan Tuan’s chubby hands went around his stomach as though she wouldn’t be able to hear the noise from his stomach if he hid it from her sight.</p> <p>“Grrroooowwlll…”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s tiny stomach didn’t give him any face and continued to rumble even louder instead.</p> <p>“Hungry? Lin Nuan asked.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nodded his head.</p> <p>Lin Nuan put down the glass of water to re-open the fridge…</p> <p>Fortunately, under Liang Mulan’s care, Lin Nuan’s fridge was constantly filled with fresh groceries.</p> <p>Lin Nuan placed Tuan Tuan on the couch again before passing the plain water to Fu Huai’an and pouring the heated milk into a glass for Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>The temperature of the milk was just right and Tuan Tuan grasped the glass of milk with both hands as he took a few gulps. When he heard Lin Nuan asking him if he wanted to eat noodles with eggs, he looked up at Lin Nuan with a milk mustache around his lips. Stretching out his tiny pink tongue to lick it off, he clutched the glass and replied, “Yes…”</p>",
  "Chapter 26: When Lin Nuan Was About 17 or 18 Years Old": "<p>Tuan Tuan answered firmly, even though he had no idea what the egg noodles Lin Nuan mentioned looked like.</p> <p>Seeing that Tuan Tuan was really hungry, Lin Nuan decided to cook up a bowl of easy to digest noodles for him. Looking sideways at Fu Huai’an, she asked out of politeness, “Mr. Fu, would you like a bowl too?”</p> <p>Regarding egg noodles, Lin Nuan felt that her culinary skills would be good enough…</p> <p>Even though they were about to receive their marriage certificate, but the way they interacted… They were extremely distant with each other, particularly the polite manner Lin Nuan called Fu Huai’an with.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked at his wristwatch. Seeing that it was no longer early and that he’d always had the habit of eating dinner, and since Auntie Li wasn’t around today… Fu Huai’an, whose taste buds had been groomed to be picky, had indeed not eaten anything that night.</p> <p>After Lin Nuan asked, Fu Huai’an took some interest in those egg noodles…</p> <p>“Sorry to bother you…” Fu Huai’an’s words were polite, but his tone didn’t convey the same—it was as though that was how it should be.</p> <p>Lin Nuan knew it was because Fu Huai’an was used to being in the higher position… His tone was out of habit and not specifically targeted at her.</p> <p>You’re welcome…” Lin Nuan said, already turning around to the kitchen to prepare.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked towards Tuan Tuan who was obediently holding his glass of milk and asked, “Do you know what egg noodles are?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan shook his head, but he still looked happy…</p> <p>At kindergarten, his friends always showed off the good food that their mothers prepared for them. It would be the first time for Tuan Tuan to eat food made by his Mama in all the years of his life so far, so he was really happy… No matter what it was, Tuan Tuan would surely love it.</p> <p>Lin Nuan took out tomatoes, eggs, and some green vegetables from the fridge.</p> <p>From where Fu Huai’an was sitting, he could see Lin Nuan being busy in the kitchen…</p> <p>Lin Nuan tied up her still wet hair and pushed up her sleeves to reveal her slender arms. She handled the fresh greens with familiarity, washing them under the tap.</p> <p>The warm kitchen light reflected off the water dripping over Lin Nuan’s fair and slender hands. They looked especially pretty…</p> <p>A girl’s home is always decorated in a cozy manner, unlike Fu Huai’an’s house which had simple designs and decorations… The color scheme was simple and calming.</p> <p>At Fu Huai’an’s, apart from Tuan Tuan’s room which had more colors, the whole house had a quiet and dull atmosphere.</p> <p>It was like Tuan Tuan couldn’t see enough of Lin Nuan’s house; his big eyes wandered everywhere. Even though it was clearly bedtime, he was still energetic and excited.</p> <p>Seeing a white cat bed placed on the balcony, Tuan Tuan ran over, his small hands pressed onto the full window as he looked out…</p> <p>The cat bed, cat litter box and toys were all neatly placed on the balcony.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an carried Tuan Tuan back and made him sit on the couch quietly, his own gaze falling on the photo frame in a corner….</p> <p>In the frame was a photo of Lin Nuan, approximately when Lin Nuan was 17 or 18 years old.</p> <p>Lin Nuan held a gray British Shorthair cat in her arms, smiling happily while the gray cat seemed to be lazing around. Eyes half-squinting while it lay comfortably in Lin Nuan’s embrace, its tail drooped lazily over Lin Nuan’s arm…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an involuntarily picked up the frame to take a good look before putting it back on its original place.</p> <p>Probably because of the long wait, plus he’d just drank a glass of milk… Tuan Tuan’s eyes started feeling tired. He rubbed his big eyes as he leaned against the back of the couch, thinking that he’d rest a while, just a while before he can eat the good food Mama was cooking up.</p>",
  "Chapter 27: Open My Arms For You": "<p>The sound of the running range hood could be heard from the kitchen, the sound ringing like a lullaby, making Tuan Tuan even sleepier.</p> <p>A phone started ringing from the living room when Lin Nuan was placing the unwashed tomatoes in the water. She looked up to see Fu Huai’an picking up the call, cigarette at the corner of his mouth. As he bent down to pick up a lighter from the coffee table, the outline of his broad back muscles showed through his tight shirt.</p> <p>He walked to the balcony and closed the sliding door, back facing the living room as he lit up the cigarette before casually pocketing the lighter—every move was filled with the charisma of a mature man.</p> <p>Lin Nuan realized that she’d been staring at Fu Huai’an’s back for a long time and she dropped her gaze with heated ears.</p> <p>Her phone, lying silently under the lamp on the corner table, showed no activity.</p> <p>Who would’ve thought that Fu Huai’an’s ringtone would be the same as Lin Nuan’s—Mendelssohn’s Rondo Capriccioso.</p> <p>At the balcony.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan’s voice spoke up on the other end of the line, “Old Fu, when are you coming over? It’s rare for Tang Zheng to come back from overseas, you’ll lose out if you don’t join us for mahjong!”</p> <p>Tang Zheng was Fu Huai’an’s childhood friend just like Lu Jinnan; the three grew up together like real brothers. Ever since Tang Zheng went overseas, the trio rarely got to reunite.</p> <p>Today after leaving the Lin family’s house, Fu Huai’an went to the party to welcome Tang Zheng back. Halfway through, Tuan Tuan wanted to see Lin Nuan, so Fu Huai’an brought the child over.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan had the speaker on and Fu Huai’an could clearly hear the sounds of the mahjong tiles.</p> <p>He moved the cigarette from his lips and pressed his thumb to his temple, saying, “I’ll go over later.”</p> <p>“Old Fu isn’t sending his child over, he’s sending himself to that lady’s bed!”</p> <p>“Bullsh*it, Old Fu’s belt is buckled tight! How many little ladies have we arranged so far? Even if they used up all their strength they still couldn’t get it off.”</p> <p>A few friends jokingly teased Fu Huai’an. There were no women there, so the men spoke without care.</p> <p>“Can they be the same? That’s Lin Nuan, Old Fu’s moonlight! Old Fu’s belt towards Lin Nuan should be: ‘My front door is always open and waiting for you, we’ll understand each other after one round, you’ll love it here…'”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan changed the lyrics and shamelessly sang a verse, causing huge laughter on his end of the line.</p> <p>After smoking one cigarette, Fu Huai’an hung up the call and entered the living room.</p> <p>Seeing Tuan Tuan slowly blinking his eyes and eventually falling asleep, he removed his suit jacket and gently placed it on Tuan Tuan, his movements careful.</p> <p>Raising his head, Fu Huai’an’s eyes reflected Lin Nuan’s busy back, which appeared so slender.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an straightened his body and unbuttoned his sleeves, placing his watch down on the small corner table on top of the Lin family’s household register…</p> <p>In the kitchen, the pot of boiling water on the stove made a noise and Lin Nuan quickly turned the flame down with a pair of chopsticks in her hand… As she turned around to add a bowl of water, she saw Fu Huai’an walking into the kitchen.</p> <p>Their gazes met and Lin Nuan was shocked for a moment. After all, Fu Huai’an in his formal attire didn’t look like he belonged in the rather small kitchen.</p> <p>“Do you need anything?” she asked.</p> <p>“I came to help…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was quite tall and his legs were long—once he entered, the whole kitchen looked much smaller.</p> <p>Lin Nuan even felt like it was harder to breathe.</p> <p>He smoothly and naturally rolled up his sleeves, bending down to wash his hands before pulling out a few pieces of the kitchen paper towels to wipe his hands… Turning around, he managed to squeeze Lin Nuan to one side.</p> <p>Lin Nuan watched as Fu Huai’an picked up the vermicelli she had placed at the side. He took out some noodles and placed them into the pot in a practiced manner, reaching out his hand and saying, “Chopsticks.”</p>",
  "Chapter 28: A Corner Of Her Heart Softening": "<p>Lin Nuan hurriedly passed the chopsticks in her hand to Fu Huai’an. Fu Huai’an’s hand touched her fingers and she felt a slight tingle in her fingertips…</p> <p>She stood at the side and watched Fu Huai’an, surrounded by the humid steam.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had never expected that the man in his formal wear would actually be so good in the kitchen.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan stayed with the Lins, her father and brother were often busy with the company’s matters and had never entered the kitchen. They were completely lost when it came to anything that involved cooking, so Lin Nuan naturally assumed that men who wore suits never entered the kitchen.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was still standing at the side, immersed in random thoughts.</p> <p>“Pass me a bowl…”</p> <p>Hearing Fu Huai’an’s voice, Lin Nuan brought a bowl over…</p> <p>Seeing the hot noodles taken out of the pot, Lin Nuan didn’t know if it counted as egg noodles that she’d prepared for Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan brought out a small bowl of noodles, the tiny Tuan Tuan had already fallen asleep comfortably on the couch with Fu Huai’an’s jacket over him.</p> <p>Lin Nuan furrowed her brows… Fu Huai’an didn’t even tell her that the child had fallen asleep.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an sat down at the dining table and ate a bite of the noodles elegantly.</p> <p>“Tuan Tuan will stay at your place for one night tonight.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan turned her head to see Fu Huai’an putting down his chopsticks and speaking to her over the steam rising from the bowl of noodles.</p> <p>Before Lin Nuan could ask further, Fu Huai’an continued, “Tomorrow after we get our marriage certificate, pack your stuff and move in to my place. Stop renting the place here.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan knew that Fu Huai’an had seen the apartment rental contract on her coffee table and knew that the contract was expiring in two months…</p> <p>Not hearing a reply from Lin Nuan, Fu Huai’an raised his head and fixed his deep gaze on Lin Nuan, saying, “Don’t tell me you’re thinking that after we get married, we’re going to live separately?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head, replying, “No, it’s just that… This place is closer to the broadcast station. If I live at your place, I’ll have to check which bus or train I have to take.”</p> <p>“It’s indeed inconvenient to get to the radio station from home. Do you know how to drive?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan nodded.</p> <p>“You can go pick a car you like…”</p> <p>Was Fu Huai’an saying that he was giving her a car?</p> <p>Lin Nuan hurriedly refused him, saying, “It’s okay. I have enough of my own savings to buy a car, but Haicheng’s traffic gets congested easily so driving a car may not be as fast as taking the train.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was a proud girl—Fu Huai’an could tell so he didn’t try to force the issue.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an ate only a bite of the noodles and he left the rest untouched.</p> <p>After a short while, his assistant sent over a suitcase containing all the stuff Tuan Tuan would need the next morning.</p> <p>Afterward, Fu Huai’an didn’t stay. He only said that he’d pick up Lin Nuan at eight in the morning to head to the civil affairs bureau. He then walked out.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was still asleep on the couch, his body covered by Fu Huai’an’s expensive, dark-colored suit jacket…</p> <p>Lin Nuan, with no experience in caring for kids, didn’t know if she should move Tuan Tuan. She was afraid that if she carried Tuan Tuan to bed, it would wake him up and interrupt the child’s sleep.</p> <p>After some thinking, Lin Nuan went to the bedroom to fetch a blanket, gently moving away Fu Huai’an’s jacket to place the blanket on Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>“Mama, don’t go…”</p> <p>As though he got a shock, Tuan Tuan’s small hand suddenly raised up as he mumbled in his dreams.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hands paused in the middle of placing the blanket on Tuan Tuan; she felt a corner of her heart softening.</p> <p>She held on to Tuan Tuan’s chubby hand while her free hand dimmed down the light of the floor lamp. She then gently stroked Tuan Tuan’s head and sat beside him, accompanying him in his sleep…</p> <p>Under the dim light, Tuan Tuan’s upset and scrunched up face finally started to relax, but his tiny hand tightened its grip on Lin Nuan.</p>",
  "Chapter 29: You’re Really Getting Married to Lin Nuan?": "<p>Haicheng’s Sky Imperial Garden was the same as that in Jincheng. Being a high-end clubhouse for tea and entertainment, it sat in the center of the city of Haicheng—a location where land was expensive—with all sorts of expensive cars parked at its doors. It was frequented by the wealthy in Haicheng as a place to enjoy tea time.</p> <p>Inside the private room, the tea arts master wearing a pure white uniform made of cotton and linen worked skillfully and elegantly. The master was completely unaffected by the sound of the mahjong table in the background, every action was extremely professional.</p> <p>The tea arts master passed a cup of hot tea to Tang Zheng whose movements were decorous as he held it to his nose to smell the fragrance, the hot steam slightly fogging up his glasses.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an sat with his legs crossed opposite from Tang Zheng. Seeing the master pass over a teacup with both hands, he calmly sat up, one hand holding onto the teacup while the other supported the cup from the bottom, treating the master with great respect.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan walked away from the mahjong table with a cigarette in his mouth and said, “Alright, you can leave now.”</p> <p>The tea arts master nodded to both Fu Huai’an and Tang Zheng before leaving the room.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an drank the tea and placed the cup down, familiarly lighting up a cigarette before carelessly placing it on the table. He then picked up the teapot with his cigarette in hand to refill his cup.</p> <p>“Not playing anymore?” Tang Zheng watched as Lu Jinnan sat down and smiled.</p> <p>“The moment Old Fu gets here, you stop playing. Without you, I can’t even win this few rounds, it’s meaningless…” Lu Jinnan tapped the ashtray with his cigarette before taking the teapot from Fu Huai’an to fill up his own cup.</p> <p>“If I play anymore, I’ll probably lose my pants to you guys…” Tang Zheng smiled.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan picked up the cup for a sip, his furrowed brows as he said, “You called a tea arts master over to drink Kuding <sup>1</sup> ?”</p> <p>“I told the tea arts master I wanted to drink Iron Guanyin tea, but that female master ignored me the moment she arrived and only asked Old Fu what he wanted. Old Fu randomly said Kuding, so all I can do is drink Kuding and suffer.”</p> <p>Tang Zheng shrugged with a helpless expression on his face.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan looked towards Fu Huai’an whose gaze remained calm and said jokingly, “What… You came over from Lin Nuan’s and you’re still so angry? Was she being a hypocrite and didn’t let you touch her?”&lt;segment 1048&gt;</p> <p>“From what Jinnan’s been saying, this woman sounds hard to settle.” Tang Zheng asked probingly “Old Fu… About this lady that Jinnan’s been talking about, are you just playing around or is your heart involved?”</p> <p>White smoke arose from between Fu Huai’an’s long fingers. Between puffs of smoke, he opened his mouth and said, his face indifferent, “We’re getting our marriage certificate tomorrow.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s voice was not loud—it was almost completely drowned out by the sound of the high-tech mahjong table rearranging the tiles—but Lu Jinnan and Tang Zheng who sat beside him heard him clearly.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan paused in shock and Tang Zheng had a look of surprise on his face.</p> <p>Eventually, the ashes from the cigarette at the corner of Lu Jinnan’s lips dropped onto the back of his hand and burned him. Lu Jinnan then hurriedly shook his hand and asked, “Old Fu, you’re really getting married to Lin Nuan?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an tapped away the cigarette ashes and raised his gaze, his black eyes looking at Lu Jinnan as he said in a neutral tone, “Do I look like I’m just playing?”</p> <p>Once Tang Zheng heard these words, he hurriedly smiled and said, “That’s good! Tomorrow after you get your certificate, take our sister-in-law out so we can meet! Our own people can gather to celebrate and Sis-in-Law can get to know us. I’ll bring a girl along! Lu Jinnan… You bring a female partner too! Otherwise, it’ll just be a table of men. Sis-in-Law will probably feel awkward.”</p> <p>At the mahjong table, Fu Huai’an’s friends started discussing upon hearing that</p> <p>“Sure sure! Since you’re getting married, that woman is our official sister-in-law, we have to meet her!”</p>",
  "Chapter 30: I Heard That She’s a Beauty?": "<p>“I don’t remember her name, all I know is that she’s the host of the Ocean City radio station…”</p> <p>“Her name is Lin Nuan, the radio hostess from six to eight every evening. Her voice is so lovely.”</p> <p>“I heard that she’s a beauty?”</p> <p>Tang Zheng kicked Lu Jinnan under the table and snapped, “Did you hear what I said?”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan put out his cigarette and answered, “I’m not deaf. I just think that Chu Xun is a better match for Fu Bro than Lin Nuan.”</p> <p>Someone from the mahjong table heard Chu Xun’s name and asked with a smile, “Whether or not Fu Bro settles down with Lin Nuan, why are you making such a fuss about it, Lu Jinnan?”</p> <p>“He’s had a crush on Fu since he was a kid, apparently…” Tang Zheng stated jokingly. He picked up his phone and cigarette box and said to Fu Huai’an, “I’m going to call my girlfriend and get her to free some time to see you tomorrow.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The next morning, Bai Xiaonian came out of Lin Nuan’s bedroom and fumbled her way to the kitchen to grab a bottle of water from the fridge. She took a sip and spotted Tuan Tuan and Lin Nuan sleeping in the living room.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian was taken by surprise.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was sitting on the carpet, her arm supporting her head. She was holding Tuan Tuan’s tiny hand and leaning on the sofa, fast asleep.</p> <p>The morning light shone through the parted curtains. The golden rays of sunlight carved out Lin Nuan and Tuan Tuan’s silhouettes—they looked like they were bathed in gold.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian leaned on the dining table, holding the bottle in one hand.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian already knew about Tuan Tuan’s identity…</p> <p>But Lin Nuan wasn’t staying with Fu Huai’an because she genuinely liked him. So, there was no need to put so much effort into bonding with her future stepchild.</p> <p>The rays of light moved leisurely across Lin Nuan’s fair, flawless cheeks and across her eyelashes. She slowly opened her eyes.</p> <p>“You slept out here all night?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian’s voice traveled across the room. Lin Nuan’s eyes squinted to block out the sunlight. She followed the source of the voice but all she could see was a green shadow…</p> <p>It wasn’t until Bai Xiaonian walked up right in front of her that she realized who it was—she could finally see her pretty face clearly.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was still holding onto Lin Nuan’s hand, with no intention of waking up.</p> <p>Lin Nuan pulled back the sheets that Tuan Tuan had kicked away last night and covered him up. She cautiously removed her hand and tucked his little elbows inside.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan wasn’t used to feeling nothing in his palms. He turned around, smacked his lips then fell right back to sleep.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian passed the milk to Lin Nuan. She noticed the traces of the hoodie left on Lin Nuan’s right cheek from when she pressed against it last night. She asked with a hint of anger in her voice as she looked at Tuan Tuan, “What are you doing out here?”</p> <p>“What time is it?” Lin Nuan asked.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s neck and shoulders were aching from sleeping in that position all night. She stretched her muscles and rubbed her neck.</p> <p>“Six-thirty…” Bai Xiaonian sat down near Tuan Tuan’s feet and propped up her legs. She looked at Lin Nuan, still sitting on the floor. “You didn’t look after this kid the whole night, did you?”</p> <p>“Nope, his father sent him over here last night.”</p> <p>“He really does see you as his mother,” Bai Xiaonian said with a grin.</p> <p>“Keep your volume down, don’t wake him up,” Lin Nuan said as she lowered her voice.</p> <p>It was only seven. The child could sleep for another hour…</p> <p>Last night, Tuan Tuan had grabbed her hand before she could dry out her hair. After a whole night, she was left with a stuffy headache.</p>",
  "Chapter 31: A Call From the Pet Shop": "<p>“Help me look after Tuan Tuan for a while. I’m taking a shower.”</p> <p>“Try to get some sleep. Take a shower after you wake up,” Bai Xiaonian said, noticing the paleness in Lin Nuan’s face.</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head and replied, “Fu Huai’an’s picking us up at eight to collect our certificate.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian replied with a troubled expression, “Lin Nuan, are you sure you don’t want to think this through a little more?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian still felt that a woman as bright and beautiful as Lin Nuan deserved to be with someone she truly loved.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t answer.</p> <p>She had already reached that point—what use was there in thinking it through?</p> <p>Fu Huai’an—the alpha of the lawyer world, the commander of Wall Street. How many women in Ocean City had dreamed and prayed to be with him?</p> <p>Not to mention, he had a devastatingly attractive face.</p> <p>For Lin Nuan, Fu Huai’an was out of her league.</p> <p>As long as a man as wealthy and grounded as him could show her basic respect, Lin Nuan was willing to give a shot at spending a lifetime with him.</p> <p>…</p> <p>When Lin Nuan came out of the shower, Bai Xiaonian was putting down Lin Nuan’s phone.</p> <p>Hearing the door of the bathroom open, Bai Xiaonian turned around and said with troubled eyes, “Nuan Nuan, the pet shop just called. They said that Mushroom doesn’t have much time left… They’re asking if you want to go see him…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan clutched the towel tightly in her hands, her nails digging deep into the flesh of her palm.</p> <p>The pain traveled through the blood vessels in her hand, piercing straight into her heart.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan sent Mushroom to the pet hospital, she was well aware that such a day would eventually come—he was, after all, an old cat.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was terrified at the thought of seeing Mushroom in pain. That was the reason she sent him to the pet hospital in the first place, to alleviate his suffering for whatever time he had left to live.</p> <p>Lin Nuan brushed her fingers through her hair and stated, “I understand.”</p> <p>Wen Moshen had entrusted Lin Nuan with Mushroom before he left. Wen Moshen had raised him for ten years and he was an extra picky cat. He wouldn’t eat anything given from strangers.</p> <p>Then as Mushroom grew more familiar with Lin Nuan, he began to eat the food she fed him.</p> <p>Every time Wen Moshen went on a business trip, he would leave Mushroom with Lin Nuan.</p> <p>It’s just that after the last time Wen Moshen left Mushroom with Lin Nuan, he would no longer get the chance to pick him up again.</p> <p>Her dripping wet hair stuck to her back, soaking up her pajamas…</p> <p>She stood dumbly at the door, forgetting what she’d come into the bedroom to find.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt as if her brain had gone blank… She stood there with vacant eyes for a while, and then went back into the bathroom to get a hairdryer to blow out her hair.</p> <p>The noise from the hairdryer flooded her ears. Slowly, her eyes began tearing up…</p> <p>All these years, Lin Nuan felt as if Mushroom was accompanying her in waiting for Wen Moshen to come back.</p> <p>If Mushroom was no longer here, then the last reminder of Wen Moshen in her life would be gone.</p> <p>Mushroom wouldn’t make it to the next time Wen Moshen came back to pick him up.</p> <p>At the very thought of that, Lin Nuan looked down and the tears kept streaming down…</p> <p>After she dried her hair, she wiped away her tears and tied her hair up into a ponytail.</p> <p>By the time Lin Nuan came out of the bedroom all tidied up, Tuan Tuan was already eating breakfast in the company of Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan had the porridge bowl in one hand and a spoon in the other. He clumsily shoved the porridge into his mouth, making a mess on his face.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian wasn’t a good chef so she ordered takeaway. She felt her stomach growl as she saw how much Tuan Tuan enjoyed the food.</p>",
  "Chapter 32: Mother and Child": "<p>“Mama!”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan called out as soon as he saw Lin Nuan enter the room.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian turned around to look at Lin Nuan, who kept a straight face as usual. She knew Lin Nuan was used to keeping things to herself.</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan, drink some porridge,” Bai Xiaonian said.</p> <p>She shook her head. The luggage case Fu Huai’an’s assistant sent last night was laying in the living room wide open, the contents inside all messed up.</p> <p>“Tuan Tuan woke up when you went to take a shower. He said the case was filled with his stuff so I dug through it to find his clothes and toothbrush… The food delivery came right after Tuan Tuan changed and washed up, so I didn’t have time to tidy it up…” Bai Xiaonian explained.</p> <p>“It’s fine, I’ll take care of it. Eat your breakfast first.”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan saw Lin Nuan tidying up his case and dropped his spoon and bowl, slid off the chair and ran over to her.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan kneeled next to Lin Nuan and with an adorable smile, he passed all the things that were thrown out back to Lin Nuan. His fair and clean face still had pudding on it that glistened under the sunlight.</p> <p>Lin Nuan smiled gently and wiped his face with a tissue.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian grinned at the sight of them. They did look like mother and child.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was always punctual. At exactly eight, he was already downstairs as promised.</p> <p>Lin Nuan held Tuan Tuan in her arms and took him downstairs. Bai Xiaonian finished breakfast and proceeded to take a nap in Lin Nuan’s house.</p> <p>Lin Nuan said to Fu Huai’an as soon as she got on the car, “Before we go to the civil administration place could you drop me off at the pet hospital first? It’s on the way, right on Liberation Street.”</p> <p>Last night he saw a kitty bed and litter box in Lin Nuan’s house as well as the British Shorthair cat she was hugging in the photo, yet there was no sign of a cat in the house—it was in the hospital after all.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an nodded. Lin Nuan gave the driver the address.</p> <p>As they reached the front entrance of the pet hospital, Lin Nuan said, “I might take a while.”</p> <p>“No rush,” Fu Huai replied in his deep voice.</p> <p>Lin Nuan closed the door and jogged into the pet hospital.</p> <p>The nurse brought Lin Nuan to see Mushroom.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt like she was walking on thin ice the entire way.</p> <p>“Mushroom kept holding on as if he were waiting for you…” the nurse said to Lin Nuan as she opened the door.</p> <p>Upon entering, Lin Nuan saw Mushroom lying in the kitty bed breathing rapidly, his tail drooping down.</p> <p>He was unable to open his eyes fully. All he could see was the blurred figure of Lin Nuan. He opened his mouth with effort and gave a weak “meow”.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s eyes grew wet despite having mentally prepared herself for that moment…</p> <p>Today was the day she and Fu Huai’an were going to collect their marriage certificate. Even with Mushroom, was it time for Lin Nuan to officially say goodbye to her past?</p> <p>Lin Nuan tried hard to hold in her tears. She walked in front of Mushroom to pat his head.</p> <p>Mushroom looked up and his body began to lightly tremble as he gently brushed the tip of his cold nose against Lin Nuan’s palms. His head then drooped down again.</p> <p>Mushroom was Lin Nuan’s cornerstone in her faith that Wen Moshen would come back. But the moment news came that morning that he was going to pass away, that faith weakened considerably.</p> <p>“Mushroom…” Lin Nuan bent over, her head pressed up against Mushroom’s.</p> <p>“Meow…” Mushroom replied painstakingly.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt a sharp pain in her chest, as if somebody had cut off a piece of her heart and it was leaking air…</p> <p>Lin Nuan closed her eyes. She couldn’t hold back her tears anymore.</p> <p>“Meowr…” Mushroom let out another deep, raspy meow.</p>",
  "Chapter 33: He’ll Probably Never Come Back": "<p>Lin Nuan knew that Mushroom missed Wen Moshen just like she did.</p> <p>Mushroom’s heavy pants pierced her heart like needles.</p> <p>“Mushroom, if you’re tired then just rest and go to sleep…” Lin Nuan choked out, “That person… he might never come back.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan mustered all the courage she had inside her to say that.</p> <p>She hugged Mushroom tightly, her heart shattereing into pieces.</p> <p>Mushroom gently licked Lin Nuan and tried to comfort her.</p> <p>After some time, Lin Nuan sensed Mushroom’s breathing growing from weak to non-existent, his head softly slipping down…</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s tears fell like a waterfall. She hugged Mushroom tightly, trying hard not to let herself cry out loud, yet her body kept trembling.</p> <p>Mushroom left, and Lin Nuan was going to get married—so who else would be waiting for Wen Moshen to come back?</p> <p>Or maybe Mushroom knew that it was too difficult to wait all alone, so he chose a day like today to leave?</p> <p>After a long time…</p> <p>Lin Nuan held Mushroom in her arms and got up. She told the nurse, “Please let Doctor Qin know that he can send Mushroom away for me, just like he told me.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan couldn’t bury Mushroom herself. The pain would be too much for her to endure.</p> <p>The nurse nodded. “Okay…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan had already wiped her tears away by the time she came out of the pet shop. But her eyes were still red.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan got out of the car, ran in front of Lin Nuan and looked up at her…</p> <p>A child was indeed sensitive. He picked up on Lin Nuan’s sorrow immediately. He wanted to comfort her but he didn’t know what to do.</p> <p>Inside the car, Fu Huai’an turned to the side and saw Lin Nuan through the car window. She was smiling and kneeling down.</p> <p>She gently took Tuan Tuan into her embrace.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s chubby little hands gently caressed Lin Nuan’s head. He imitated the way his father treated him when he was sick, whispering in a child-like voice, “There there now, Mommy is going to be okay.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan hugged Tuan Tuan tightly, savouring the solace and warmth he fed to her heart.</p> <p>She smiled under the sunlight, her defined features softening under the haze.</p> <p>Inside the car, Fu Huai’an waited patiently for Lin Nuan’s mood to settle down.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t say a word the entire ride. She kept her eyes fixed outside, her expression displaying either relief or total blankness.</p> <p>At the entrance of the civil administration building, Lin Nuan checked her identity card and personal documents once again before handing them over to Fu Huai’an’s assistant.</p> <p>Upon alighting the car, Fu Huai’an grabbed Lin Nuan’s hand without saying a word. Shocked, she unconsciously wanted to pull back her hand, but she controlled the urge to do so.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s strong grasp wrapped Lin Nuan’s long, slender fingers into his, the warmth causing Lin Nuan to panic inside.</p> <p>She turned and looked at Fu Huai’an. She felt that his strong features looked more defined than ever against the backdrop of the sun.</p> <p>The fitting suit enveloped Fu Huai’an’s tall, defined figure, making his legs appear even more longer than usual.</p> <p>He had already caught a lot of attention after he got out of the car. After all, a man like him with such a magnetic, alpha-like presence caught attention effortlessly wherever he went.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt uncomfortable and awkward holding his hand. She tucked her hair behind her ear, yet as soon she touched her ears she realized they were burning hot.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an and Lin Nuan’s hand-holding garnered a lot of attention.</p> <p>Inside the car with the company of the driver, Tuan Tuan leaned on the car window and looked at their entwined hands, a bright smile spreading across his face….</p>",
  "Chapter 34: Moshen’s Return": "<p>When Lin Nuan was in the pet hospital, Fu Huai’an’s assistant told Tuan Tuan that after Fu Huai’an and Lin Nuan collected their certificate today, he wouldn’t be a motherless child anymore.</p> <p>He would also have a mother, and his was the prettiest one in the whole world.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked deeply at Lin Nuan’s clear features and said in his deep voice, “Let’s go…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan nodded. Her hand in Fu Huai’an’s already had a layer of perspiration on it…</p> <p>There weren’t many steps on the stairs from the parking lot to the entrance of the administration building. They reached the entrance in a few steps.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s assistant took out the filled form and passed it to Fu Huai’an and Lin Nuan. All they needed to do was sign it.</p> <p>“I didn’t bring a pen…”</p> <p>LIn Nuan said as she held the form in one hand. Fu Huai’an’s assistant immediately took one out of the pocket of his suit, popped open the cap and passed it to Lin Nuan.</p> <p>“Thank you…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan accepted the pen. Seeing that the desks were already crowded by people filling up their forms, she walked to the wall and pressed hers up against the wall, preparing to sign it…</p> <p>Before she could, her phone started ringing.</p> <p>The observant assistant Xiao Lu approached Lin Nuan to help her hold her form in place for her.</p> <p>Lin Nuan thanked him again.</p> <p>It was Lin Chen calling.</p> <p>She answered the phone.</p> <p>On the other end of the line, Lin Chen paused for a minute. Listening to his serious voice, Lin Nuan felt a ringing in her head and then her brain went blank…</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan, Moshen came back…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan had dreamt of the scenario many times in the past four years—somebody calling her with the news of Moshen’s return. Yet after every brief rush of elation, she was only left with more despair in her heart…</p> <p>And that day, she actually received the call in real life. Her eyes grew wet… but she remained surprisingly calm and silent.</p> <p>“They found him at sea. He was floating for some time until somebody spotted him. The doctor said he wouldn’t make it much longer… He’s in the Ocean City Hospital now, hurry over here! If you’re late you might never get to see him again!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan grasped the pen in her hand tightly.</p> <p>“You should go…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan turned around, shocked, only to see Fu Huai’an’s face.</p> <p>She took a long look at him in his suit, his jet black eyes radiating a feeling of indifference and unfathomableness—as if he knew everybody’s heart inside out—with a composure that transcended all worldly matters.</p> <p>As he walked out of the administration building, he stood on the high flight of stairs with a cigarette in his mouth.</p> <p>Under the golden sunlight, his expression appeared solemn and cold.</p> <p>He dug out the lighter in his pocket and covered up the flame with one hand, lighting up his cigarette.</p> <p>He couldn’t find a word to describe what he felt right then. In the whirling smoke he gazed into the distance in deep contemplation.</p> <p>His phone vibrated in his pocket. He picked it up.</p> <p>“Fu Brother, did you collect your marriage certificate yet? Lu Jinnan and I booked the whole country club to ourselves. Let’s go have a barbeque and fishing session today, beats just sitting together at some boring table drinking beer,” Tang Zheng said in a bright tone.</p> <p>“No, I didn’t….” Fu Huai’an flicked the cigarette.</p> <p>“That’s fine, we’ll go to the country club first to wait for you two. You guys collect your certificate first, after that…”</p> <p>Before Tang Zheng could finish her sentence, Lu Jinnan snatched the phone away and said, “Why so slow? Which district are you guys at? Should I ring up their chief in charge?”</p> <p>With one hand in his pocket, he bit the cigarette in his mouth. His eyes were half open in the swirling smoke. He said in a calm voice, “There’s no need for that. We won’t be collecting the certificate anymore.”</p>",
  "Chapter 35: Who Didn’t Want Their Hands on The Information?": "<p>Lin Nuan rushed to the hospital. Moshen was still in the operating room.</p> <p>A sea of journalists were crowding around the hospital entrance. Four years ago, the flight T-324 airline had disappeared along with all passengers on board. Yet out of the blue, one passenger had been miraculously discovered by a fishing boat out at sea. It was indeed explosive news—which media outlet didn’t want to get first-hand information on the incident?</p> <p>Not only that, the passenger was the reputable and handsome celebrity of Ocean City, and heir of the Wen Cooperation.</p> <p>During Lin Nuan’s cab ride to the hospital, the radio itself was flooded with the news of his return. The driver complained he couldn’t listen to his beloved comedy anymore.</p> <p>Many relatives of the disappeared passengers had their faith rekindled upon news of Wen Moshen’s return. Everybody was praying for Wen Moshen to make it, so that they could hear the news from his own mouth that their family members were still alive and stranded on some nameless island in the sea.</p> <p>Lin Chen was talking with the doctor outside the operation room. A past classmate of Lin Chen and Wen Moshen, his last name was Song. Lin Nuan had seen him before.</p> <p>Wen Moshen’s parents and brother, Wen Moshi, crowded around Doctor Song, listening to him describe his medical condition with great care.</p> <p>Doctor Song mumbled something that made Wen Moshen’s mother’s body tilt to one side as if losing its sense of gravity—thankfully her husband immediately supported her back up with his strong grip.</p> <p>The most cruel thing in the world would probably be something like that—when you finally come so close to healing the pain in your heart after losing a loved one, suddenly they come back to rekindle that hope inside you, only to experience once again that same kind of excruciating disappointment and pain.</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood at the elevator door with clenched fists, unable to budge.</p> <p>The elevator door opened again.</p> <p>“Please make way…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan got bumped to the side. She scooted over and clutched the purse in her hand.</p> <p>Lin Chen laid eyes on Lin Nuan standing at the elevator door. He had a deeply troubled look in his eyes. His expression relaxed a little as he said something to Doctor Song then walked towards Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan tried hard not to display the wave of agonizing emotions inside her, but her watering eyes betrayed her .</p> <p>“Since you’re already here… why aren’t you going in to see him?”</p> <p>Sniffing her nose, Lin Nuan looked up, her clear eyes staring at the tall and slender Lin Che.</p> <p>Lin Chen knew all too well Lin Nuan’s feelings for Wen Moshen.</p> <p>“What did Doctor Song say?”</p> <p>The light above the operation room went off and the door opened.</p> <p>Lin Chen turned around and saw Wen Moshen being pushed outside. Doctor Song approached his colleague about Wen Moshen’s condition.</p> <p>The main surgeon operating on Wen Moshen said, “The patient has a very strong will to live…”</p> <p>Needless to say for a man who miraculously returned after disappearing for four years.</p> <p>Wen Moshen’s brother, Wen Moshi, entered the office with the main surgeon.</p> <p>Seeing Wen Moshen’s parents again after so many years, she realized they had aged quite a lot.</p> <p>After the airline disappeared, they were in great pain at losing such a great son.</p> <p>Wen Moshen was still unconscious inside the ward. Looking at Wen Moshen’s closed eyes, the pain in Lin Nuan’s heart felt unbearable.</p> <p>She pictured countless scenarios on how Wen Moshen would make his return—all except that one.</p> <p>“The Doctor said all should be well. If brother can wake up within three days, he should be fine,” Wen Moshen told his parents.</p> <p>“Just now those notices from Medical Crisis came pouring down like rain—it must have comprised his vitality. Once he wakes up we’ll need to re-furnish it for him,” Wen Moshen’s mother said as she kept her eyes fixed on her son through the glass</p>",
  "Chapter 36: Like an Eternity Long": "<p>Lin Nuan examined Wen Moshen’s emaciated face. Four whole years felt like an eternity long. The heaviness in her heart made it hard to breathe.</p> <p>Lin Chen still had matters to attend to. He received one call after another from the office.</p> <p>“Lin Chen, Lin Nuan… thank you both for coming to see Moshen.” Wen Moshen’s father still upheld his classy elegance in showing his gratitude towards them, “Little Song, thank you for entering the operation room to specifically ask about Moshen’s condition. He would be glad to know about that once he wakes up. It’s getting late, you should attend to your own matters—I’ll call you once he wakes up.”</p> <p>Lin Chen nodded and turned towards Lin Nuan. “It’s four-forty already, I’ll drop you off at the radio station…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s show began at six.</p> <p>“It’s out of your way, I’ll take a cab there myself…”</p> <p>Furrowing his eyebrows, Lin Chen was going to say something when Wen Moshen stated, “Brother Lin Chen, let me send off Nuan Nuan. I’m going back to my company, it’s along the way…”</p> <p>Wen Moshen’s father nodded, “Let Moshi drop you off. Your company is making so many calls, it must be an urgent matter.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Nuan sat in Wen Moshen’s car without saying a single word.</p> <p>She looked outside at the streets moving backward, her thoughts on Mushroom who had just passed away today.</p> <p>If Wen Moshen had come back just a bit earlier, how glad would Mushroom be?</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan, Nuan Nuan?” Wen Moshi called her twice.</p> <p>“Yes?” Lin Nuan snapped out of her thoughts, her hand numb from the vibration of her phone.</p> <p>Wen Moshi turned the steering wheel and glanced at Lin Nuan through the corner of his eye, “Your phone is ringing, why are you daydreaming?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian was calling. Lin Nuan picked up.</p> <p>“Have you reached the radio station yet?”</p> <p>“On the way…”</p> <p>“Then bring back two doughnuts from Haiwei’s place for me. And two cups of warm milk tea,” Bai Xiaonian said, unable to contain the joy in her voice.</p> <p>“Okay.”</p> <p>As she hung up, Lin Nuan saw that they were approaching Haiwei’s Doughnut shop and said to Wen Moshi, “You can drop me off right at the entrance. The radio station is only one turn away, I’ll walk there once I finish buying my stuff.”</p> <p>“It’s fine, I’ll drive you there…”</p> <p>Wen Moshen turned on the indicator and pulled over to the side of the road.</p> <p>“Thank you for sending me here. It’s only a short distance so I can walk there myself. Goodbye…” Lin Nuan said as she got out of the car. Wen Moshen mouthed a few words with his lips but before he could get her to stay a little longer, she had already closed the door.</p> <p>Wen Moshen watched as Lin Nuan entered the Haiwei doughnut shop and stood last in line behind the long queue. After hesitating for a moment, he left.</p> <p>Business was booming in the Haiwei Doughnut shop. There was always a long queue. Lin Nuan didn’t like sweet food that much, but she often accompanied Bai Xiaonian to visit that place.</p> <p>As Lin Nuan came out of the shop with the doughnuts and milk tea in her hands, to her surprise she saw Wen Moshi outside smoking near his car.</p> <p>He put out the cigarette after seeing her come out of the shop and flashed her a smile.</p> <p>Wen Moshi did leave just then, but he decided to turn back at the second traffic light.</p> <p>It was because Wen Moshen’s return had deeply moved him. Especially when the notices of medical crises came out one after another from the operating room, he suddenly gained a deeper understanding of how fragile life was.</p> <p>He didn’t want to regret not doing certain things until he lost the opportunity to do them, and he didn’t want to agonize over things he didn’t say until he couldn’t speak of them anymore.</p> <p>Wen Moshi walked in front of Lin Nuan and offered to carry the packages for her, but she stepped back right in time.</p> <p>“The station is just one turn away and a three-minute walk, you don’t need to drive me there…”</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, I have something to tell you…” Wen Moshi usually never called her by her name so formally—he had always addressed her by “Nuan Nuan” like Wen Moshen did.</p>",
  "Chapter 37: But You Have No Idea That I Liked You": "<p>Wen Moshi and Wen Moshen had almost identical features—they both had heart-warming smiles. Wen Moshi’s features, however, were more defined and delicate than Moshen’s.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had also crushed on somebody before. She knew what that burning gaze meant.</p> <p>A song by Harpo “Only You” began to play in the music store on the roadside, the beat messing with Wen Moshi’s heart. He felt somewhat nervous and put one hand in his pocket, revealing his uneasiness.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt her face tighten up. She pretended to glance at her watch and said, “My colleague is still waiting for me to bring her the doughnuts and milk tea, we should talk about this some other day…”</p> <p>Wen Moshi’s hands curled up in his pockets. He grabbed Lin Nuan, who brushed past his shoulder and said, “This won’t take long.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan wanted to pull back her wrist but he only tightened his grasp.</p> <p>Gazing at her long hair, he took a deep breath and said with great determination, “Lin Nuan… I’m 26 years old, and I’ve never been in a relationship before. The real reason I didn’t go on those dates arranged by my mother wasn’t because I wanted to focus on my career and be as great as my brother—that’s just the excuse I gave my mother. It was because I already had somebody I liked, but I didn’t have the guts to say it out loud. I was afraid it would make things awkward and ruin a good friendship.</p> <p>“It’s been eight years, Lin Nuan. I know you like my brother, but you don’t know that I’ve liked you all this time…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan clenched the plastic bag tightly in her hands. So people already knew about her feelings towards Wen Moshen.</p> <p>…</p> <p>The red light flashed on at the crossroad.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan parked his car and looked at Tuan Tuan through the rearview mirror. He was fast asleep on Fu Huai’an’s leg, covered with his suit as if it were a blanket. His white little face radiated a warm red like the hue of an apple.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan smiled and unintentionally laid eyes on Lin Nuan and Wen Moshi outside, who were standing at the entrance of the doughnut shop near the road.</p> <p>He rolled down the car window to take a proper look—it was her, Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Naturally, he clearly saw that Wen Moshen was holding Lin Nuan’s hand. He said with a grin, “No wonder she suddenly changed her mind at the administration unit—so she’s into the young pretty boys!”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked up and glanced at the roadside through the car window…</p> <p>“You just want to have a one-night stand with somebody, why go through so much effort just to get a marriage certificate? This type of women looks upright and dignified, but there’s more than enough ways to win her over. You don’t need to put in so much effort. The easiest solution is simple and rough, if you’re willing, I can take care of it for you within a week.”</p> <p>“Don’t interfere in this,” Fu Huai’an said coldly.</p> <p>He looked away and gently patted Tuan Tuan on his legs with one arm. He used his right hand to light up the cigarette in his mouth. His slender long fingers rolled down the car window as he exhaled the smoke and flicked the cigarette outside.</p> <p>He kept his unfathomable gaze fixed on Lin Nuan through the smoke.</p> <p>School ended earlier on Fridays. A group of middle-school students were chasing each other on their bikes on the pedestrian lane. The pedestrians dodged away from them as they threw them the side eye. The leader of their pack turned around to look at his friends chasing him from behind when his bicycle brushed across Lin Nuan’s back.</p> <p>“Careful!” Wen Moshi pulled Lin Nuan closer. The students had already gone too far before he could confront them.</p> <p>Lin Nuan furrowed her eyebrows. Without warning, she caught eyes with that familiar pair of dark pupils hidden behind the smoke. Her heart was suddenly left hanging in mid-air, and she felt sheepish and timid as if she were caught cheating.</p> <p>It was Fu Huai’an.</p>",
  "Chapter 38: Lin Nuan Doesn’t Settle for a Relationship": "<p>Lin Nuan immediately pulled back her hand from Fu Huai’an’s grasp. She stood stiffly, keeping a distance between them.</p> <p>Holding the plastic bag, she tucked her loose strands of hair behind her ear to cover up her uneasiness.</p> <p>She was grateful that Fu Huai’an let her take off at the administration building that morning, but she didn’t dare to expect he would leave things at that.</p> <p>So she didn’t want to leave Fu Huai’an the impression that she was a promiscuous woman, ready to cheat on him the second she got the chance.</p> <p>The green light flashed on.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan released the brakes and asked, “Are you really into this girl?”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan knew his question was redundant. If Fu Huai’an wasn’t, why would he choose to collect his marriage certificate with her?</p> <p>Fu Huai’an didn’t answer. Lu Jinnan knowingly shut his mouth and kept silent.</p> <p>At the door of the Haiwei Doughnut Shop, Lin Nuan watched as the car carrying Fu Huai’an took off, her eyebrows furrowing.</p> <p>Wen Moshi felt his throat growing dry as Lin Nuan kept silent.</p> <p>“My brother returned, so I was afraid that if I didn’t tell you this… I might never get the chance again,” Wen Moshi said, gulping underneath his collar, his ears red like a strawberry, “I won’t force you to give me an answer now. Just think about it.”</p> <p>All Lin Nuan had to do was leave to get out of the awkward situation.</p> <p>But since she had no intention of giving Moshi any chance, she didn’t want to act all indecisive and muddled which would only delude him into thinking there was still hope—it would keep him hanging in mid-air.</p> <p>Since the elephant in the room was already addressed, she didn’t mind making things more awkward than they already were.</p> <p>“Moshi, we don’t belong in the same league. You’re the second heir of the Wen Family, yet I’m no longer the pampered girl of the Lins. My father is a well-known fraud in Ocean City and my mother is a mentally ill lunatic…</p> <p>Wen Moshi wanted to say something but Lin Nuan cut him off.</p> <p>“If you don’t mind this, your parents will. I don’t have the energy or the courage to fight for us… and at the end of the day I won’t love you romantically—not ever.</p> <p>Wen Moshi’s lips pressed tightly together.</p> <p>“What sense does it make for us to be together when I clearly have feelings for your brother? You might not mind me treating you like a substitute, but I do. I spent my whole childhood playing and growing up together with you, so I know you’re good enough to make a good girl fall for you.”</p> <p>No sugar-coated words could cover up the fact that Lin Nuan rejected him. Despite being mentally prepared for it, Wen Moshi still felt a blow to his heart.</p> <p>Lin Nuan accurately communicated three messages across to Wen Moshi: Firstly, she didn’t like him; Secondly, she wouldn’t settle for a relationship; and lastly, he was her good friend and nothing more.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, you really do speak too bluntly,” Wen Moshi said to alleviate the awkwardness, twitching his lips.</p> <p>“Because it’s you, I don’t want to be on the fence when rejecting you just because I feel bad. Since I know what your personality is like, if I tell the truth as it is we can still be friends. But if I turn you down after giving you hope for too long we might not even be able to keep this friendship anymore”.</p> <p>Wen Moshi knew her first sentence was the truth. The second one, however, was simply Lin Nuan letting him down easier.</p> <p>When she put it that way, even Wen Moshi felt bad at the idea of them growing distant because of her turning him down.</p> <p>Wen Moshi knew Lin Nuan was always smart.</p> <p>Wen Moshi let out a long sigh. He smiled to conceal the anguish in his heart and said, “Let me send you off…”</p> <p>“There’s no need. It’s a turn away. I’ll head off first…”</p> <p>Wen Moshi stood there, flustered, as he watched Lin Nuan’s thin figure walk away.</p>",
  "Chapter 39: Those Who Know Nothing, Fear Nothing": "<p>If he didn’t say anything he would still have a strand of hope left—but after being rejected for vocalizing his feelings he gave up all hope.</p> <p>No matter what he did, he wouldn’t be as good as Wen Moshi, as deserving of Lin Nuan’s love.</p> <p>…</p> <p>As soon as Lin Nuan came out of the elevator, she saw a crowd huddled around the station manager’s office door. There was apparently a scene going on inside.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian spotted Lin Nuan from the crowd and dashed towards her in her high-heels.</p> <p>She grabbed Lin Nuan’s arm and lowered her voice, “That old Lee pervert was just in the middle of you-know-what with Wu Qianying in the office and they got caught by his wife by surprise. My gosh… Wu Qianying’s face was beaten up so badly. Lee wanted to close the door but his wife is keeping it wide open and shouting out loud to get people to come take a look at these shameful people.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian wasn’t merely laughing at his misery. It’s just that even somebody mildly attractive working in the radio station these days would get hit on by Lee Zhiguo. Bai Xiaonian originally had a great opportunity to host the noon show on Ocean City’s channel, but Lee Zhiguo came onto her and said as long as she was willing to sleep with him, she could even secure the position of the late-night host.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian rejected his offer. Lee Zhiguo shamelessly kept her stuck in the radio station.</p> <p>Lee Zhiguo also thought of hitting on Lin Nuan, but the girl was smart and had the guts to stand up for herself when other girls would just cry and keep things to themselves if they were harassed.</p> <p>Lin Nuan only got hit on once and she marched straight into the manager’s office one morning and made a speech during their afternoon meeting about sexual harassment in the workplace, in order to raise awareness amongst her coworkers. She didn’t bring up Lee Zhiguo’s name specifically, but it was enough to intimidate him and make him give up on the idea of harassing her. However, he didn’t give her any more opportunities for career advancement either.</p> <p>“I’ve heard that our staff was on the hunt for a morning host. Guess what? Lee recommended Wu Qianying,” Bai Xiaonian said as she grabbed Lin Nuan to watch the commotion at the door.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t like scenes like that. She’d taken a brief glance into the office when she got pushed into the middle of the crowd.</p> <p>The usual well-dressed and radiant Wu Qianying had nothing left on her. Lee Zhiguo’s wife who was twice her weight was sitting on and cursing at her. She aimed straight for Wu Qianying’s face and slapped it hard until it turned swollen. Wu Qianying had blood all over her nose and mouth.</p> <p>Lee Zhiguo only had a pair of underwear on. He was wearing a set of handcuffs and sitting on the sofa looking as timid as a mouse, not daring to say a word.</p> <p>The office was flooded with Wu Qianying’s desperate pleading and the piercing vulgarities coming from Lee Zhiguo’s wife.</p> <p>Lin Nuan grimaced at the repulsive scene before her.</p> <p>Lin Nuan pushed her way out of the crowd, some of which were filming the scene.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian also came out of the crowd and saw that Lin Nuan was just dialing the security number on her phone. Bai Xiaonian snatched her phone away and said in a low voice, “Can’t you see that nobody in our whole department is calling for security? This Lee guy is too despised, that’s why everybody just wants to watch the scene.”</p> <p>“There’s screaming noises all over the entire floor, it’s just giving me a headache,” Lin Nuan said in an agitated voice. She took back her phone and passed the doughnuts and milk tea to Bai Xiaonian, “Stay and watch the commotion. I’m going to the recording room.”</p>",
  "Chapter 40: Piece Of Cake": "<p>Lin Nuan had arrived even earlier than the editor today. She made herself a cup of tea and leaned on the table in the recording room, propping herself up with one hand, buried in her messy train of thoughts.</p> <p>Wen Moshen’s frail face popped up, followed by Fu Huai’an’s penetrating gaze through the mist.</p> <p>“Why is it only you? Where’s your editor Meng Meng?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian came back from watching the commotion. She saw Lin Nuan standing alone in the recording room, staring blankly into the distance with her headset around her neck.</p> <p>“There might be a traffic jam since it’s Friday night…” Lin Nuan took a sip of the cup of tea in her hands, “Done with the commotion?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian walked over and leaned against the table next to Lin Nuan and said with a smile, “The longer I watched the more pointless it seemed. Everybody was well aware of what kind of person Lee was, but the second something like this happened his wife attacked and beat up Wu Qianying instead. She didn’t even touch his husband despite yelling all kinds of vulgarities at him… Sigh. Why do women make life harder for one another?”</p> <p>Men become emboldened in their actions just because there were too many women like Lee Zhiguo’s wife. Those men knew they wouldn’t get hurt when they got caught. Their own husbands cheated on them, yet they would push the fault to another woman instead.</p> <p>How could a beautiful woman in her prime like Wu Qianying be willing to give herself to a dirty old man?</p> <p>Once a man develops impure thoughts toward a woman, he would do all kinds of corrupt things, especially to women like Wu Qianying who rely on men to survive and to progress in their careers.</p> <p>Wu Qianying made a choice between her body and her future, and she chose the latter…</p> <p>The majority of people in society would choose the latter since people had long grown corrupt and given up their principles beneath the facade of glamour in the modern age.</p> <p>Compared to investing their blood, sweat, and tears in their dreams, trading their bodies for a bright future seemed much easier.</p> <p>“Hey, Lin Nuan’s here…”</p> <p>The colleague who just passed by the recording room took a few steps back and said to her, “The morning news department’s director just called for you and said that it was an emergency. He needed you on set ASAP!”</p> <p>He then rushed off with the cup of coffee and files in his arms.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian and Lin Nuan exchanged a triumphant glance.</p> <p>The director of the morning news department, Miss Summer, was a famous badass. She never wasted her time meeting irrelevant people. She must have chosen Lin Nuan to host the morning show when she called her to go on set all of a sudden.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian rose up and stomped her feet in excitement. But she was careful not to be too loud in case other people heard them. She lowered her voice with great effort and said, “Girl, your lucky day has arrived!”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian was even happier for Lin Nuan than herself for getting the opportunity. She nagged Lin Nuan to rush over there.</p> <p>The office for the morning news channel was on Level 13 of Building A in the radio station. It would take less than ten minutes to get there from Building B.</p> <p>It was already late afternoon. The spacious morning news office had a chill vibe to it. Only seven or eight employees were organizing news scripts and other items in front of the meeting table, appearing relatively busy. The rest of the office was empty and quiet…</p> <p>Building B and Building A had a different decor. The whole building structure and design was based on glass. Rays of sunlight fell into the room through the transparent west windows. The room was clothed with a layer of soft orange and the whole office appeared spacious and classy, unlike their department.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan come out of the elevator, the staff inside the meeting room pushed open the glass door and asked, “Who are you looking for?”</p>",
  "Chapter 41: We Both Know the Reason": "<p>“I’m Lin Nuan from the broadcasting department…” Lin Nuan introduced herself.</p> <p>“Oh, it’s you!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was staring at the row of empty office desks. Miss Summer’s assistant explained with a smile, “Our morning news department is usually the busiest from four to eight a.m. We’re done with our meeting around nine to ten in the morning, so everybody either goes back home to catch up on sleep or outside to collect their news pieces as journalists.”</p> <p>They reached Miss Summer’s office entrance.</p> <p>Before entering the room, LIn Nuan saw Miss Summer standing in front of her desk. She had short hair and was wearing a white collar shirt with black culotte.</p> <p>The table was flooded with open file cases. Miss Summer’s shirt sleeve was tucked back to her elbow, revealing a fair and slim forearm. She had a lady’s cigarette in her mouth that was nearly finished. She nimbly flipped through her paperwork with narrowed eyes.</p> <p>Inside the office was a cloud of smoke. A whole wall of muted television screens was broadcasting news from all kinds of channels.</p> <p>Miss Summer’s assistant knocked on the glass door before pushing it open. He said,” Miss Summer, Lin Nuan is here.”</p> <p>“Let her in,” Miss Summer said without looking away from her paperwork, her voice sounding somewhat raspy from her smoking habits.</p> <p>Miss Summer’s assistant smiled at Lin Nuan and made a gesture of invitation.</p> <p>“Thank you…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan entered the room and stood in front of Miss Summer. Before she could say anything, Miss Summer stated, “You may have heard that our department was on the hunt for a morning news host. I have no interest in nurturing a freshie here, but with Ling Sister being pregnant at 38 years old, she decided to take leave from work to wait for her due date in comfort. And so I have no choice but to select a new host.”</p> <p>Miss Summer put down the file in her hands and picked up another one. She glanced at the humble Lin Nuan and noticed her clear, sparkling eyes, and she continued.</p> <p>“The normal procedure is for the new host to go on air only after the selection process. But twenty minutes ago, Ling Sister took a fall and was rushed to the hospital so she definitely can’t make it for tomorrow’s live broadcast, which leaves me no choice but to find somebody else for the spot.”</p> <p>Miss Summer put out the cigarette in her hands and stated in a straightforward manner, “Your radio station originally recommended Wu Qianying. I heard that she caused a commotion back there so I have no use for someone like her. Ling Sister recommended you to me. I looked through your portfolio and it says here you were the dean of your faculty in your graduation year, the top student amongst the applicants for the television station. Not to mention, you’re a pretty girl. I think we both know why you’ve been stuck at the radio station for so many years.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was amazed at Miss Summer’s efficiency. Since the outbreak of the accident, she had already managed to complete so much within twenty minutes.</p> <p>But Lin Nuan had never interacted with the host of the morning show before, so why did Wen Ling recommend her to Miss Summer!</p> <p>“I hope you won’t let me down,” Miss Summer said as she looked up at Lin Nuan.</p> <p>“I understand.” Lin Nuan nodded.</p> <p>“By the way…” Miss Summer whipped out a long lady’s cigar and pinched it between her fingers. “Here’s a little reminder for you. Live television broadcasting is different from audio broadcasting. If you want to go far you have to have a unique style for yourself. You can mull it over when you get home.”</p>",
  "Chapter 42: The Cat Was Supposed to Be Lin Nuan’s Gift": "<p>Maybe it was the nice vibe that Lin Nuan gave Miss Summer—she still appeared collected and humble despite landing an opportunity like that—or maybe it was the fact that Lin Nuan would rather stay in the radio station than sacrifice her body to advance her career; Miss Summer had come to develop an appreciation and liking towards her. That’s why she decided to give her a piece of advice.</p> <p>Lin Nuan entered the elevator after leaving Miss Summer’s office.</p> <p>She pressed the button for the first floor. She looked up and saw the screen inside the elevator broadcasting the news of Wen Moshi returning after disappearing for four years on the T-324 flight. The reporters were interviewing Gu Hanyan who had just walked out of the hospital.</p> <p>Gu Hanyan told the press that Wen Moshen hadn’t woken up yet and thanked them for their care towards him.</p> <p>Everyone was well aware that Gu Hanyan was Wen Moshen’s amber. He pampered her like she was the only gem in the world. Gu Hanyan never revealed that she had a boyfriend before in all these years that Wen Moshen had disappeared. Thus the media naturally narrated Gu Hanyan and Wen Moshen’s story into one in which the love-struck princess faithfully waits for her other half to return.</p> <p>Some had even claimed that it was Gu Hanyan and Wen Moshen’s unbreakable love that made Wen Moshen’s return possible.</p> <p>The people who just arrived from the elevator were also discussing Gu Hanyan and Wen Moshen. Listening to the people in the elevator applauding the legendary love story of those two, Lin Nuan looked at the floor and silently shifted to the corner of the elevator.</p> <p>The news of Lin Nuan going to the morning news department had reached the radio department later on.</p> <p>After the scandal between Wu Qianying from traffic broadcasting and Lee Zhiguo from radio broadcasting had come out, Wu Qianying was sent straight to the hospital after a good beating and Lin Nuan was suddenly switched to the television department. The upper management of the broadcasting department fell into chaos.</p> <p>It was easier to manage traffic broadcasting since Wu Qianying had a partner that could host the show alone. But Lin Nuan had gone solo on her own show since the beginning. Her channel had the largest audience and it was unclear who would be able to immediately take her position after she left.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Aunt Lee was on leave today and Fu Huai’an had a business trip to go on, thus he decided to bring Tuan Tuan along with him.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was convinced that Fu Huai’an was going to send him to his mother’s place. He pulled out his race-car-shaped luggage case and started stuffing it with his clothes and beloved toys and books.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an stood in front of Tuan Tuan’s brilliantly colored bedroom door and said with a frown, “You don’t need to bring so many toys. The racing car and dolls are unnecessary; you should make some room for your pajamas, hoodie, and shoes.”</p> <p>Filling up his luggage case with his butt in the air, Tuan Tuan turned around and said with perfect enunciation in a childish voice, “My pajamas are at mommy’s house…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an suddenly remembered that Tuan Tuan’s luggage case was still at Lin Nuan’s place.</p> <p><em>“Ding-Dong—”</em></p> <p>As the doorbell rang, Fu Huai’an rubbed his mildly aching temples and said to Tuan Tuan, “Don’t pack too many toys. I’ll come check later.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an went downstairs to open the door.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s assistant stood outside the door carrying a cat cage in his hands. The doorstep had cat food, a cat bed, cat toys, cat litter and other cat items placed on it.</p> <p>“Boss… here’s the cat you wanted.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked depressed when she went to the pet hospital today. So Fu Huai’an went to ask a nurse in the hospital about the situation. She said that Lin Nuan’s cat wasn’t going to make it, which made Fu Huai’an suddenly recall the picture of Lin Nuan hugging it.</p> <p>The cat was supposed to be a gift for her.</p>",
  "Chapter 43: Don’t All Kids Like It?": "<p>Fu Huai’an looked inside the cat cage. A gray British Shorthair was curled up inside. It looked up at him with a defensive glance, its clear eyes somehow reminding him of Lin Nuan.</p> <p>He couldn’t bring himself to ask his assistant to send the cat away.</p> <p>He grabbed the cat cage and watched the assistant arrange the cat items in the house.</p> <p>“Ah, yes…” The assistant put down the cat litter and stood up to ask Fu Huai’an, “Miss Lin was in a rush to leave today so she left her identification card. Should I keep it safe until she needs it again for the collection of the certificate? Or should I leave it with you?”</p> <p>“Pass it to me.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an took the personal identification card and lit up a cigarette. He sensed the cat paws were clawing at the cage. As he looked down, a gray cloud dashed past him and leaped onto the flat screen television in the living room. With nimble movements, its paws stomped on the thin screen while it claimed higher ground. The cat sized up Fu Huai’an, looking ready to escape at any minute.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an realized he couldn’t leave the cat alone at home when he was going on the trip later. He removed the cigarette from his mouth and said with a frown, “Catch it.”</p> <p>The huge chubby cat was agile for his size. Fu Huai’an’s assistant fumbled around the whole room without being able to catch it.</p> <p>The assistant stood downstairs, drained, watching as the cat sat at the top of the staircase meowing mischievously at him. He had a look of existential despair on his face.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan heard the meows from the staircase, flung the toys out of his hands and ran outside.</p> <p>A cat’s ears are very sensitive. As soon as it heard the footsteps, it turned around and stared guardedly behind it with its round eyes, prepared to run away at any second.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan hugged the big cat fiercely before it could successfully escape.</p> <p>“Meow…!”</p> <p>The chubby cat let out a screech when it was suddenly hugged tightly by Tuan Tuan. Fu Huai’an’s fingers tensed up around his cigarette as he was worried that Tuan Tuan would get scratched by the cat.</p> <p>“Kitty!” Tuan Tuan cupped the chubby cat by its chest and stood up.</p> <p>The cat suddenly transitioned from energetic to submissive. Its forepaws rested on Tuan Tuan’s skinny little arms, its tail was brushing against on the floor as it let Tuan Tuan drag its body downstairs.</p> <p>“Dad… the cat?” Tuan Tuan’s huge black eyes beamed with excitement.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an walked to the staircase with a cigarette in his mouth, a troubled expression on his face.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an picked up the chubby cat by its neck as Tuan Tuan carried it downstairs. The cat was even more submissive in his hands, its round, amber eyes staring into Fu Huai’an’s as it tried to gauge its owner’s mood.</p> <p>“The cage…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s assistant immediately fetched the cat cage.</p> <p>He shoved the chubby cat inside and closed the door. The cat meowed loudly inside and scratched the door with its paws.</p> <p>As Fu Huai’an was signaling his assistant to take the cat away, Tuan Tuan suddenly hugged Fu Huai’an’s leg and looked up asking, “Is this cat for mommy?”</p> <p>Apparently, Tuan Tuan also saw that photo in Lin Nuan’s house.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the way back home from the broadcasting station, Lin Nuan visited the supermarket since Fu Huai’an asked her to look after Tuan Tuan tonight when he went on a business trip.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had never babysat a kid before and she had no idea what kind of snacks to prepare for him back home.</p> <p>She pushed the trolly forward and saw a mother grab a child by his arm and scold him, forbidding him from eating junk food. The child had tears in his eyes as he pointed at the chips, shamelessly making a scene.</p> <p><em>Chips—don’t all kids like them?</em></p> <p>Lin Nuan usually didn’t consume food like that. She pushed the trolly in front of the shelves, grabbed a bag of chips and carefully read the instructions written at the back of the packaging.</p>",
  "Chapter 44: What Would Fu Huai’an Think?": "<p><em>‘Too many additives inside,’ </em>Lin Nuan thought as she put down the chips and looked for a healthier snack with fewer additives for Nuan Nuan.</p> <p>Her phone vibrated inside her bag. Liang Mulan was calling.</p> <p>“Mom…” Lin Nuan answered as she put a bag of imported cookies in the trolly.</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan, I talked to your father about you collecting the certificate today. He said Fu Huai’an was now officially part of the family and he wants us to pick a date to have dinner at the Mang Jiang Tower. Why don’t you and Fu Huai’an talk it over and pick a suitable time?”</p> <p>Liang Mulan gave a barely audible sigh as she talked over the phone.</p> <p>She originally intended for Lin Nuan to bring her husband back to have a nice dinner at home. But they finally decided to eat outside after taking into account Lin Ran’s sentiments.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hands tensed up. Liang Mulan’s question reminded her of what Bai Xiaonian pulled her over to say in the parking lot…</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian told her that Wen Moshen returning right before they got their marriage certificate might be some kind of sign from the universe. If Lin Nuan was really that in love with Wen Moshen, why shouldn’t she try confessing her feelings to him instead of marrying a stranger? She might even get together with the person she actually loved.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian also said an alpha male like Fu Huai’an who was on top of the food chain would never tolerate a woman leaving him at the altar right before they got married just because of another man!</p> <p>She asked Lin Nuan to properly think it through for the sake of her lifelong happiness. Even if she didn’t marry Fu Huai’an, Wen Moshi was back, and the Gu Family wouldn’t force Gu Hanyan into marriage again.</p> <p>“I understand, Mom. I’ll discuss it with him when I get back.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t tell Liang Mulan they hadn’t collected the certificate so she wouldn’t end up overthinking things.</p> <p>After paying the bill, Lin Nuan left the supermarket with her hands full of groceries. The cold wind and rain greeted her outside.</p> <p>It was drizzling outside. You could tell the rain wasn’t heavy in the illuminating orange haze.</p> <p>She tucked strands of hair—loosened by the wind—behind her ear, and ran back home with the groceries in one hand, using the other to shield her head with her bag.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s neighborhood was right behind the supermarket and a short distance away. Lin Nuan however still felt penetrated by the moist air when she reached home.</p> <p>It was nine by the time she finished stacking up and organizing the fridge.</p> <p>She was unsure when Fu Huai’an would drop Tuan Tuan over so she didn’t dare take her shower yet, in case nobody opened the door for him when he arrived and rang the doorbell.</p> <p>She dabbed her hair with the towel and went to warm up a glass of milk. She took a few sips from the cup as she leaned on the dressing table.</p> <p>By nine, Tuan Tuan still hadn’t arrived.</p> <p>Lin Nuan sat on the sofa with crossed legs. She opened her laptop and watched a video of Wong Ling hosting the morning show.</p> <p>Lin Nuan picked up her phone and checked the time when it was ten. She hesitated whether or not she should call Fu Huai’an…</p> <p><em>“A man like Fu Huai’an who’s on top of the food chain would never tolerate a woman leaving him at the altar for another man!”</em></p> <p>Bai Xiaonian’s words popped up in Lin Nuan’s head without any warning. She felt her heart beating rapidly in panic. Her finger stopped in mid-air before it was just about to hit dial.</p> <p>If Fu Huai’an already decided not to collect the marriage certificate with her, then what would he think if she suddenly called him?</p> <p>At ten-thirty, Lin Nuan stood before the sink in a distraught manner. She scooped up a handful of water and splashed her face with it, but that was not enough to pacify her frantic train of thought.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s phone rang in the living room. She immediately grabbed the towel to dry her face and ran outside.</p> <p>The screen showed Bai Xiaonian’s name.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt a hint of disappointment in her heart for some reason.</p>",
  "Chapter 45: Really Burned My Eyes!": "<p>Lin Nuan picked up the call.</p> <p>“Xiaonian…”</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan, look at Weibo!” Bai Xiaonian gloated. “Gu Hanyan is really becoming famous now…”</p> <p>“What happened?!” Lin Nuan tilted her head to the side, resting the phone between her face and her shoulder as she flipped the laptop screen up, quickly opening up Weibo.</p> <p>The matter concerned Wen Moshen’s woman, so Lin Nuan naturally paid extra attention.</p> <p>“Gu Hanyan was still acting like she was deeply in love this afternoon, but afterward someone revealed photos of her being intimate with three men—the kind that wasn’t censored, it really burned my eyes!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan searched the hot topics engine and clicked on the photos that showed Gu Hanyan naked with three men of different skin colors, the images having high exposure.</p> <p>She suddenly remembered Fu Huai’an saying to let Wen Moshen’s woman unable to marry anyone else, and only able to obediently wait for Wen Moshen.</p> <p>Did Fu Huai’an do this?</p> <p>Seeing a man’s large hand holding onto one of Gu Hanyan’s full breasts, Lin Nuan felt her heart burn up… Flashing back to that night with Fu Huai’an. She immediately shut down her laptop with heated ears.</p> <p>“Did you see it? You think the Wens can accept their daughter-in-law being involved in this kind of entertainment with others?” Bai Xiaonian’s voice, clipped with laughter, rang near Lin Nuan’s ears. “Nuan Nuan, you really won’t consider confessing your love to Wen Moshen?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t answer.</p> <p>So what if she confessed? The Wens wouldn’t accept Wen Moshen having a girlfriend that had a mentally ill patient as her mother.</p> <p>She hung up. It was 11:10 p.m but Fu Huai’an still hadn’t sent Tuan Tuan over.</p> <p>She guessed that Fu Huai’an probably wouldn’t send Tuan Tuan over, nor would he sign the marriage certificate with her.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was a mature, charismatic man with a successful career and plenty of women around him. The number of women who wanted to become Mrs. Fu were countless and plenty of them were prettier than her. Unless he really loved her deeply, what man would be able to accept a woman who ran away on the day of signing their marriage certificate, and then calmly go with her to sign it on another day?</p> <p>Not signing the certificate anymore, it was supposed to be a good thing.</p> <p>But when she saw the luggage Tuan Tuan still had in her living room, Lin Nuan felt uneasy.</p> <p>She felt as though she was a stall owner who had already received the down payment but was unable to hand over the goods, and was then being nailed onto the humiliating board of dishonesty.</p> <p>Lying on the bed, Lin Nuan tossed and turned, finding it hard to fall asleep.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was a grown and mature man who had already lost the rashness of youth; he should not have the spare time to have a put Lin Nuan on the spot. Since he wasn’t coming, it probably meant that he wasn’t going to register for marriage with her.</p> <p>Lin Nuan turned and remembered that night with Fu Huai’an. It was no longer the conservative society of the past; Fu Huai’an didn’t have to be responsible towards her just because that one night, and she didn’t have to stubbornly marry him just because she gave her first time to him.</p> <p>That night he had made it clear—he lacked a woman, and he used his stamina to show Lin Nuan that men his age had high demands regarding their desires, so if it wasn’t Lin Nuan, he could have chosen another woman.</p> <p>She was not narcissistic to the point of thinking that Fu Huai’an liked her; even though the outside world portrayed Fu Huai’an as a mature, stable man with a clean private life, Lin Nuan still believed that the man retained his most primitive bad behavior. If he was really as clean as what others described him to be, why would he have hinted that kind of stuff to Lin Nuan, and then taken her under those circumstances?</p> <p>Lin Nuan just happened to satisfy the two conditions Fu Huai’an had in choosing a partner—a woman and a mother Tuan Tuan could accept.</p> <p>Hearing the sound of the increasingly heavy rain outside of the window, Lin Nuan smiled at herself mockingly; a woman was easy to find but a mother that Tuan Tuan accepted was hard, that was probably Fu Huai’an’s opinion of her.</p>",
  "Chapter 46: Lin Nuan Who Had Just Arrived": "<p>With the kind of status and position Fu Huai’an held, there were many outstanding women surrounding him and countless others were queueing to just spend a night with him. Lin Nuan didn’t believe that Fu Huai’an would be able to completely detach himself from that ocean of flowers.</p> <p>She wrapped the thin blanket around herself tightly. She thought that tonight, her brain should have been filled to the brim with Wen Moshen who had just returned.</p> <p>Dawn, at 3.30a.m.; Lin Nuan was already up to get ready for the four a.m. meeting for the morning news.</p> <p>After spending more than three hours spacing out without sleep, Lin Nuan forcefully woke herself up with a heavy head. She splashed her face with cold water and grabbed a bottle of milk and some bread for breakfast before rushing out.</p> <p>Nearing 4a.m., the rain was exceptionally heavy. By the time Lin Nuan reached the entrance of the broadcasting building holding up her umbrella, half of her pants were already wet.</p> <p>She put away her umbrella and heard someone calling her name…</p> <p>Raising her head, she saw that it was Miss Xia’s assistant, whom she had met yesterday. He exited his parked car and used a file to cover his head as he rushed towards Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Miss Xia’s assistant was still wearing the same suit he wore the previous day and when they stood closer, Lin Nuan could smell the light scent of lady’s perfume on him.</p> <p>The duo reached the elevator and Miss Xia’s assistant pressed the button on the elevator as he smiled and said, “My name is Yang Yuze, but you can call me Xiao Yang. I didn’t expect you to come so early.”</p> <p>“It’s not early, it’s already 3.50a.m…” Lin Nuan replied politely.</p> <p>Yang Yuze shook his head with a smile, saying, “You’re considered quite early. Last time, Sister Lin always came at four-thirty a.m., because female anchors pay extra attention to their faces… They believe beauty sleep is very important.”</p> <p>When the two walked into the morning news department, Miss Xia had already arrived and was just carrying a cup of coffee out of the break room.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Yuze and Lin Nuan exit the elevator together, she moved her gaze after one look. Clearly, she had misunderstood the reason for Lin Nuan and Yang Yuze appearing at the same time; young people had energy and vigor, she didn’t want to interfere.</p> <p>At exactly 4a.m., everyone entered the meeting room.</p> <p>Lin Nuan never knew that the morning news department would be so lively at 4a.m. Miss Xia stood at the very end of the long table holding her cup of coffee as she listened to everyone speaking up and sharing their opinions, then she would individually critique them, saying harsh and sharp words that cut straight to the point.</p> <p>In the end, Miss Xia placed her coffee cup down and let Yang Yuze pass the news manuscript to Lin Nuan, saying, “Let us welcome our new news anchor, Lin Nuan, and bless that her first broadcast will be smooth and successful! That will be all… Dismissed!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan picked up her manuscript and familiarized herself with it as she had her make-up done.</p> <p>Inside the dressing room, with Weng Lin’s photo hung up on the wall, the make-up artist was still rambling continuously to Lin Nuan about how good Weng Lin was to her, and how important Weng Lin’s position was in the morning news department, as though she was afraid Lin Nuan would steal Weng Lin’s position.</p> <p>That was the discrimination the morning news department had towards her, a newcomer. Lin Nuan had experienced it before in the radio department, so she paid no attention to it.</p> <p>The make-up artist talked a lot by herself but Lin Nuan didn’t reply even once. She internally concluded that Lin Nuan was acting virtuous, but she forgot that if Weng Lin had been the one memorizing the script and she had so much to say, she would have been scolded.</p> <p>Ding—</p> <p>Her phone vibrated and Lin Nuan picked it up to take a look— it was a message from Bai Xiaonian, telling her to do well for her first broadcast, and she had attached a photo of her big smiling face.</p> <p>Just as Lin Nuan was about to reply, she felt a burst of pain at her scalp.</p> <p>“Ouch…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan sucked in a breath as a small tuft of her hair was tugged off.</p> <p>“Sorry…” The make-up artist smiled insincerely, saying, “I didn’t mean it, but it’s just a few strands of hair. Lin Nuan, you won’t be so petty that you’d hold it against me, right?”</p> <p>The make-up artist spoke with a smile. She thought that by using words to corner her, Lin Nuan who had just arrived would only be able to admit defeat and tell her it was okay.</p>",
  "Chapter 47: Not A Slap Instead?": "<p>Who would have known that Lin Nuan would straight away throw her script onto the dressing table and stand up?</p> <p>Lin Nuan, with her height of 1.72 meters and her high heels, had a domineering aura when she stood up, causing the make-up artist to take an involuntary step back</p> <p>Lin Nuan scanned the nametag at the front of the make-up artist’s shirt, saying, “Shen Weiwei, I know that Sister Lin has a high status and is important in the morning news department, I don’t need you to, so early in the morning, specifically pick the time where I’m memorizing my script to come and remind me, if you’re taking this opportunity to tell me… that if I want to get your recognition like Sister Lin did, I’d have to gift you branded bags and cosmetics like she did. If so, then sorry—that’s not my style. We’re all getting paid to do our share of work; no one owes anyone anything.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan saw that the make-up artist Shen Weiwei still had the small tuft of her hair in hand so she casually used her phone to take a photo.</p> <p>Shocked, Shen Weiwei hurriedly threw away the hair in her hands.</p> <p>“I already said I didn’t do it on purpose! We’re all colleagues here…” Shen Weiwei replied guiltily.</p> <p>Since she had already gotten the evidence, Lin Nuan kept her phone in her pocket, and said with a strict face, “If Sister Lin didn’t give you bags and cosmetics, would you have chosen a time where she was memorizing a script to ramble on and on, then found an opportunity to pluck off a tuft of her hair? Are you sure that if you do that, Sister Lin would still give you bags and cosmetics, and not a slap instead?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was indeed a newcomer, and she did not want to fight with someone on the first day of work. She tried her best to calm down, but when she saw her hair she still couldn’t resist saying the last line.</p> <p>Shen Weiwei couldn’t bring herself to apologize as she tightened her grip on the comb.</p> <p>These past years, Shen Weiwei had been pampered by Sister Lin and she always thought that she had a special position in the morning news department.</p> <p>“This is the first time, and I hope the last time. I’m not asking you to treat me like you do Sister Lin, I just want you to do your job well so we can interact like normal colleagues. Fighting won’t do either of us any good!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan said what she had to and returned to her seat at the dressing table, picking up her script once more.</p> <p>Pale-faced, Shen Weiwei stood behind Lin Nuan as she bit her lips, hesitating for a moment before stepping forward to style Lin Nuan.</p> <p>…</p> <p>It was Lin Nuan’s first time on the morning news but she had a good sense of being on the camera. After reviewing the news script, she basically never looked at the screen for the next line. Even as she reported the return of Wen Moshen who had disappeared for four years on the T-324 flight, Lin Nuan’s voice remained calm without the slightest tremble.</p> <p>Miss Xia was extremely satisfied with Lin Nuan’s performance. Different from Weng Lin’s style, Lin Nuan’s style was more simple and clear-cut, excellently portraying the seriousness of the news. Seeing Lin Nuan’s face and listening to her voice, the news sounded extremely credible.</p> <p>Nearing the end, Miss Xia carried her coffee and exited the broadcasting room only to see Shen Weiwei standing behind the door with tears in her eyes.</p> <p>“Miss Xia…” Shen Weiwei barely opened her mouth as she choked up and started tearing up.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After the broadcast ended, the whole broadcast room was filled with applause congratulating Lin Nuan on the success of her first broadcast.</p> <p>Lin Nuan thanked them with a smile.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, Miss Xia wants you to visit her office…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan arrived at the door to Miss Xia’s office to see Shen Weiwei crying on the sofa while surrounded by a group of people.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan knock on the door, those people looked towards her in an unfriendly manner, as though they were looking at an unwelcome outsider.</p> <p>Lin Nuan could guess that it was a scene where the villain complained before she could, so she ignored Shen Weiwei and stood firmly in front of Miss Xia’s desk, saying, “Miss Xia, you were looking for me…”</p> <p>“Shen Weiwei said that she accidentally tugged at your hair, and so you slapped her?” Miss Xia asked.</p>",
  "Chapter 48: No One Owes Anyone Anything!": "<p>Lin Nuan didn’t explain. She took out the phone in her pocket and pressed the play button.</p> <p>“Shen Weiwei, I know that Sister Lin has a high status and is important in the morning news department. I don’t need you to, so early in the morning, specifically pick the time where I’m memorizing my script to come and remind me, if you’re taking this opportunity to tell me… that if I want to get your recognition like Sister Lin did, I’d have to gift you branded bags and cosmetics like she did. If so, then sorry—that’s not my style. We’re all getting paid to do our share of work; no one owes anyone anything.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan had started the recording from the moment Gu Weiwei plucked off her hair. At that moment, Bai Xiaonian had just sent her message over, and since Shen Weiwei wanted to fight, Lin Nuan, of course, had to be prepared.</p> <p>People can be evil. Lin Nuan never sought to harm others, but she must be prepared to defend herself, otherwise how else could she survive in the industry? She would have ended up being reduced to someone plain and normal, or she’d have to train herself to be so good at acting that she lost her own identity</p> <p>Throughout Lin Nuan’s speech, no sound of slapping or screaming could be heard in the recording. Afterward, there was only the sound of Lin Nuan flipping through the pages of the script and the sound of the hairdryer. Then, it was the sound of the door opening, and the conversation Lin Nuan had with Miss Xia upon arriving at the recording studio.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Nuan stopped the recording on her phone and looked at Miss Xia with a clean and clear gaze.</p> <p>It was Shen Weiwei who was sitting on the couch being comforted by a group of people who got a shock—she never would have guessed that Lin Nuan had recorded their interaction.</p> <p>Miss Xia’s eyes scanned Lin Nuan and she couldn’t guess what the young lady had experienced for her to be so careful and meticulous in handling these kinds of matters.</p> <p>The truth of the matter was out and clear. Miss Xia took out a thin long cigarette made for ladies and her gaze swept across Shen Weiwei as she said, “Tomorrow I’ll arrange a new stylist for you.”</p> <p>Shen Weiwei’s face which had been red from the hit immediately lost all its color as blood drained from it, saying, “Miss Xia…”</p> <p>Without further pursuing the matter to mock Shen Weiwei or plead for her, Lin Nuan put away her phone and said, “If there’s nothing else Miss Xia needs me for, I’ll go and remove my make-up.”</p> <p>Miss Xia nodded her chin in approval.</p> <p>Actually, Miss Xia knew that the slap was not done by Lin Nuan—slapping oneself and being slapped by others, the marks left behind had quite a difference.</p> <p>Miss Xia had experienced the kind of methods Shen Weiwei had used before, but perhaps it was out of curiosity; Miss Xia wanted to see how Lin Nuan would handle the situation.</p> <p>But what Miss Xia saw, was a woman who was more careful and guarded than she herself had been in the past.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s phone received endless notifications ever since the broadcast ended and she guessed that they were all congratulatory texts.</p> <p>After removing her make-up in the dressing room and watching the video of her own broadcast, Lin Nuan finally sat down to personally reply to each text.</p> <p>After she exited the broadcasting building, it was already ten-thirty a.m. Lin Nuan bought soy milk and fried dough fritters from a breakfast store at the entrance of the area</p> <p>People who were eating breakfast at that time were few, so the fritters had to be fried on the spot.</p> <p>As Lin Nuan waited while carrying her soy milk, she turned on her phone to look at the news, only to see a certain piece of content just as she clicked the page…</p> <p>The Wen family’s oldest son had regained consciousness this morning, after being missing for four years. How will he face his lover who has been with three other guys? Will he forgive her for doing so out of loneliness or will he be angry and unforgiving of her betrayal?</p> <p>Lin Nuan heard her own heartbeat pick up speed and her mind went blank. Wen Moshen was awake?</p> <p>Without taking her fried dough fritters, Lin Nuan quickly hailed a cab.</p> <p>“Lady! Your fritters!”</p> <p>The boss shouted while holding the fritters, but Lin Nuan ignored him and quickly entered the car.</p> <p>In the car, Lin Nuan’s heart was beating rapidly.</p> <p>He woke up? Then would Wen Moshen be heartbroken at seeing the news about Gu Hanyan?</p>",
  "Chapter 49: How Did This Happen To You?": "<p>Fu Huai’an’s tall and broad figure suddenly popped up in Lin Nuan’s mind, Gu Hanyan’s news… Was he the one who released it?</p> <p>Exiting the cab, Lin Nuan jogged to the door of Wen Moshen’s ward but lost courage just as she was about to open the door…</p> <p>Her hands clenched tightly into fists, but she lacked the strength to push the door open.</p> <p>The door was slightly open and inside were the sounds of Gu Hanyan crying and Wen Moshen’s deep voice speaking words of comfort.</p> <p>Through the slight gap, Lin Nuan saw Wen Moshen’s gaunt face and the tiredness in his features. Despite being unhealthily thin, it couldn’t cover his elegance and gentleness.</p> <p>“It’s alright, no matter if this matter is true or false, I’ll still choose to forgive you. After all, no one can handle four years of loneliness, I’ll make sure this matter gets pressed down. Please stop crying…”</p> <p>“Moshen, I’m sorry… I’m really sorry, I had too much to drink that night, and I really missed you too much…”</p> <p>Four years of loneliness was not something anyone can handle?</p> <p>Mushroom couldn’t handle it, so it left…</p> <p>Lin Nuan actually couldn’t hold it anymore, that must be why… She had promised Gu Hanyan to look for Fu Huai’an!</p> <p>A sour feeling suddenly washed over Lin Nuan, causing her heart to ache.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t go in. As she walked out of the wards building, her heart was full of blank confusion.</p> <p>She stood under the dark gray sky. Maybe it was because she hadn’t slept well, but her eyes felt uncomfortably dry and sore.</p> <p>Thinking back to the conversation Wen Moshen had with Gu Hanyan earlier, Lin Nuan felt that the four years she spent waiting seemed extremely childish. She was not Wen Moshen’s wife, nor his lover, so what exactly pushed and supported her to wait for him for four years?</p> <p>Or was she hoping at the very bottom of her heart that after four years, if Wen Moshen returned, something would change? Hoping that someone who didn’t love her would suddenly fall for her?</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt that she was ridiculous.</p> <p>“Mama…”</p> <p>Amongst the chaotic noise, Lin Nuan faintly heard Tuan Tuan’s voice.</p> <p>She turned her head.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was running excitedly towards Lin Nuan wearing a small sized patient’s clothing. Just as he was about to jump onto Lin Nuan, he paused and looked up at Lin Nuan with a smile, slightly out of breath.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s forehead had a piece of gauze on it, his fair-skinned face looking like a small pao.</p> <p>Lin Nuan bent down and brushed Tuan Tuan’s bangs away to take a proper look, asking, “How did this happen to you?”</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan’s slightly teary and reddening eyes, Tuan Tuan’s chubby hand covered the white gauze on his forehead and smiled at Lin Nuan, saying, “It doesn’t hurt…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s heart ached even more.</p> <p>Before Lin Nuan could say anything else, Tuan Tuan saw Fu Huai’an walking quickly towards him amongst the crowd, and he shouted with sparkling eyes, “Papa!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan turned her head and met Fu Huai’an’s deep gaze.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s long legs worked quickly as he came over, his face clearly indicating that he had been rushing.</p> <p>The black fitted suit outlined Fu Huai’an’s perfect figure and brought out his looks. His mature and stable aura gave off a huge pressure that made any pedestrians in his way unknowingly make a path for him automatically.</p> <p>Seeing Fu Huai’an once more, Lin Nuan felt guilty.</p> <p>Even though at the council office, it was Fu Huai’an who allowed Lin Nuan to go, Lin Nuan still felt a sort of traitor’s guilt filling up her heart.</p> <p>Because Wen Moshen wasn’t present so she decided to get married to Fu Huai’an. Because Wen Moshen was back so she left Fu Huai’an at the council office. No matter how she looked at it, Lin Nuan felt like someone who was heartless and had ulterior motives.</p> <p>Seeing Fu Huai’an walk over, Lin Nuan straightened up and subconsciously moved over to the side to avoid disturbing the father and son’s time.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an took one look at Lin Nuan before he bent down to pick Tuan Tuan up.</p>",
  "Chapter 50: Do You Know How To Drive?": "<p>Fu Huai’an’s assistant followed behind closely, and he nodded towards Lin Nuan politely as a form of greeting.</p> <p>“Mama!”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan saw that Fu Huai’an was walking away after picking him up so he shouted uneasily, his big pretty eyes filled with anticipation.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an stopped walking and turned to the side to look at Lin Nuan, his eyes deep and distant.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t dare to take Fu Huai’an’s unreadable gaze as an invitation, but seeing Tuan Tuan, she still took two steps forward.</p> <p>She asked Fu Huai’an’s assistant in a soft voice, “Last night, Mr. Fu didn’t send Tuan Tuan to my place, was it because Tuan Tuan was admitted to the hospital?”</p> <p>Towards Fu Huai’an, Lin Nuan was instinctively guarded, but talking to his assistant, Lin Nuan was much more relaxed.</p> <p>“Well, no, last night Mr. Fu was about to leave for his overseas trip so he had no choice but to ask his friend to take care of Tuan Tuan. Once Mr. Fu arrived at Jincheng, he heard that Tuan Tuan knocked his head and got injured, so he hurried back,” Fu Huai’an’s assistant explained</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hands clenched into fists—no wonder Fu Huai’an looked so tired and like he’d been in a rush.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt that the guilt in her heart was absurd.</p> <p>It wasn’t her who told Fu Huai’an not to send Tuan Tuan over. She’d spent the entirety of last night waiting for Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>Inside the VIP ward, Auntie Li was just bending over to disinfect the bed frame and table when she heard footsteps approaching and raised her head. She was slightly surprised, asking, “Sir, why are you back? Miss Lin is here too?”</p> <p>Auntie Li had rushed over after receiving the news that Tuan Tuan had been admitted into the hospital that morning.</p> <p>Lin Nuan saw Auntie Li carry the tub of water to go and wash the towel. Probably because she had been bending down for too long, her movements were slow.</p> <p>Lin Nuan took over the tub and said, “I’ll go, you should rest.”</p> <p>Inside the bathroom, Lin Nuan stood in front of the sink and rinsed the towel filled with the scent of the disinfectant.</p> <p>Through the door, she could faintly make out the voices of Fu Huai’an talking to Tuan Tuan. He sounded deep and strict like he was lecturing him.</p> <p>By the time Lin Nuan finished washing the towel, the nurse had already brought away Tuan Tuan for a check-up and Auntie Li had followed. There was only Fu Huai’an and Lin Nuan left in the ward.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an had already removed his jacket and he was standing by the open window, his slender fingers holding onto a cigarette, white smoke blurring his facial features from Lin Nuan’s sight.</p> <p>She tried to remain calm as she walked to the coffee table to get tissues to wipe her hands clean. Looking down, she said, “Well… if there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was still not used to being alone with Fu Huai’an. Seeing his deep facial features and his perfectly proportioned body, Lin Nuan would involuntarily think of that night and her ears would heat up.</p> <p>“I’ll give you a lift,” Fu Huai’an said as he bit onto his cigarette and reached for his jacket.</p> <p>“There’s no need! I’ll just call a cab and go home myself…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan quickly stepped forward. Just as she was about to pick up her small green clutch, Fu Huai’an’s hand slowly lifted it up.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s masculine scent mixed with the slight scent of his cigarettes invaded Lin Nuan’s sense of smell. The distance between the two quickly narrowed due to Lin Nuan’s anxious steps.</p> <p>The clutch looked extra small in Fu Huai’an’s hands and Lin Nuan felt nervous.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s lids closed halfway as he spoke through the white smoke, “Your passport is still with me…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan paused before remembering that she had left in such a hurry yesterday that she’d forgotten to take her passport.</p> <p>“Do you know how to drive?” Fu Huai’an asked.</p> <p>Lin Nuan nodded—Fu Huai’an had asked that exact same question before.</p> <p>“Then you can drive…”</p> <p>Without giving Lin Nuan the chance to hesitate, Fu Huai’an directly passed the keys to Lin Nuan, his brows drawn slightly together.</p> <p>It was clear that Fu Huai’an was a little tired after not sleeping for a whole night… Even if Fu Huai’an was made of steel, it was inevitable for him to have a slight headache.</p>",
  "Chapter 51: Really Treating Her As An Assistant?": "<p>Lin Nuan held onto the keys which still had Fu Huai’an’s lingering warmth, and she reached over to take her own clutch.</p> <p>Their fingertips touching, Lin Nuan knowingly ignored her rising heartbeat. Acting as though everything was normal, she asked, “Is your car parked in the basement garage or the first floor?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was unwilling to show cowardice in front of Fu Huai’an, but her increasingly reddening ears betrayed her feelings.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s gaze swept across Lin Nuan’s ears, so small and delicate… and flushed red with shyness.</p> <p>Sensing Fu Huai’an’s scrutiny, Lin Nuan straightened up her gaze and tried to remain calm, but even her neck grew red.</p> <p>“Garage.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked away and extinguished the cigarette, stepping out of the ward before Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan bit her lips in frustration.</p> <p>Perhaps it was because Lin Nuan and Fu Huai’an were still strangers that weren’t well-acquainted yet did the most intimate thing in the world, so Lin Nuan instinctively felt embarrassed. It made her unable to face Fu Huai’an naturally and calmly.</p> <p>Raising her hand to tuck a stray strand of hair behind her burning ear, she adjusted her breathing and calmed down before rushing to keep up with Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Coming down from the escalator, Fu Huai’an’s phone vibrated—it was a call from Lu Jinnan.</p> <p>He passed his jacket to Lin Nuan and gestured for her to enter the car.</p> <p>Really treating her as an assistant?</p> <p>Lin Nuan took over Fu Huai’an’s jacket and carried it in her arms, walking towards the car parked opposite the elevator.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s car was parked right opposite the elevator and his car plate number was too obvious. It was hard for Lin Nuan to forget.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan’s slender back, Fu Huai’an dropped his gaze and picked up the call.</p> <p>Lin Nuan placed Fu Huai’an’s jacket on the backseat before opening the car door to the driver’s seat and sitting down, checking out the familiar car.</p> <p>“Old Fu, I’ve found a loophole in the contract with Huan Yu. Are you still at the hospital?” Lu Jinnan sounded extremely excited.</p> <p>“I’m about to leave.” Fu Huai’an’s voice remained deep and magnetic.</p> <p>Lin Nuan tugged the safety belt over herself as she watched Fu Huai’an, who was still on the phone. The dim light from the basement’s elevator lobby traced his sharp features and brought out his masculinity, his mature aura showing through each move he made.</p> <p>Sensing Lin Nuan’s gaze, Fu Huai’an raised his own, deep and dark.</p> <p>Lin Nuan lowered her gaze, embarrassed, and clicked the safety belt into place, pretending that she was familiarizing herself with the car’s controls as her heartbeat picked up the pace.</p> <p>The corners of Fu Huai’an’s lips raised slightly as he raised his hand to look at his wristwatch, saying, “One-forty p.m., come to my house.”</p> <p>“One-fourty p.m.? We might as well eat outside, let’s go to the Jiang Man restaurant!” Lu Jinnan replied happily, evidently in a good mood.</p> <p>“I still have something on, you can go.” Fu Huai’an didn’t want to speak to Lu Jinnan anymore. He hung up and walked towards the car.</p> <p>To Lin Nuan’s surprise, Fu Huai’an did not sit in the back. Instead, he opened the car door to the front passenger seat and sat down.</p> <p>The car was originally wide, but once Fu Huai’an entered, it appeared slightly cramped.</p> <p>Seeing Fu Huai’an take out a cigarette without putting on his seatbelt, Lin Nuan could tell that he didn’t often sit at the front.</p> <p>“Do you mind?” Fu Huai’an asked her.</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head. Fu Huai’an then rolled the window down and lit up the cigarette.</p> <p>“Your seatbelt…” she said as a reminder.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked sideways at Lin Nuan and seeing that she wasn’t going to start driving if he didn’t put on his seatbelt, he reached over to click his own seatbelt in place.</p> <p>It had been a long time since Lin Nuan last drove. As she drove out to the bustling main street from the underground garage, she had an extremely careful look on her face.</p>",
  "Chapter 52: Why Make Life Harder for Yourself, Fu Brother?": "<p>Fu Huai’an’s hand rested on the car window with the cigarette between his fingers. Experiencing a mild headache, he leaned his head on the car seat and closed his eyes.</p> <p>Through the corner of her eye, Lin Nuan noticed that he didn’t smoke the cigarette after lighting it up. He had a troubled expression as he let the smoke dissipate through his fingers.</p> <p>The distance from Ocean City Hospital to Fu Huai’an’s home was quite far. By the time they arrived and she parked the car, Fu Huai’an was fast asleep.</p> <p>“Mr. Fu…” she called out.</p> <p>He didn’t budge, his eyebrows furrowing.</p> <p>“Mr. Fu…” She tried waking him up again.</p> <p>There was still no response.</p> <p>Last night, Fu Huai’an rushed over because of Tuan Tuan’s injury. He must be tired.</p> <p>Lin Nuan grabbed the steering wheel, wondering if she should just leave him there and take off.</p> <p>But if she took off just like that, what would become of the Lin Family’s identity documents?</p> <p>She suddenly felt a wave of drowsiness as she was hesitating. She didn’t sleep all night either and couldn’t hang on much longer at that point. In a few minutes, she fell asleep as well as she leaned on the car window.</p> <p>By the time Fu Huai’an woke up, it was already half past one. He never slept for long—Lin Nuan’s comforting scent must have soothed his nerves and made it possible for him to have such a relaxing sleep in the car.</p> <p>He took a glance at Lin Nuan who was fast asleep as she leaned on the window.</p> <p>She was wearing a skin-toned shirt with a wide V collar. As she tilted her head, the outlines of her fair neck appeared so elegant-looking, her collar bones surfacing and disappearing from view with her even breaths.</p> <p>The Lin Nuan stripped of makeup had a tranquil look on her face. Her features were so defined she looked like a real-life sleeping beauty.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an grabbed his suit’s coat from the backseat and covered Lin Nuan with it…</p> <p>In her dreams, Lin Nuan sensed that strong yet familiar scent. She squirmed uneasily but was unable to stay awake and dozed off again.</p> <p>Hearing somebody knock on the car window, Fu Huai’an looked up and saw Lu Jinnan. He propped one hand up on the car and bent over to glance at Lin Nuan inside the car. He looked at Fu Huai’an with an ambivalent smile on his face.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an got off. They both leaned on the front of the car.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan passed over a contract to Fu Huai’an with a cigar in his mouth. He said with a straight face, “If you’re willing to sue them yourself, Huanyu’s manager will pay fines until they’re broke. Are you sure you want us to settle this in public?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an didn’t accept the contract.</p> <p>“Both you and Huanyu’s manager should be well aware that it’s easier for him to offer thirty percent of the shares.” Fu Huai’an looked down, lit up a cigar and tucked the lighter in his pant pocket. “Your intentions will be too obvious if you carry this out too conspicuously,” he said as he tapped on the contract with his cigar-wielding fingers.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan couldn’t read Fu Huai’an’s unfathomable gaze through the mist.</p> <p>He took back the contract and glanced inside the car. “I’ve heard Lin Nuan had an unpleasant interaction with a makeup artist this morning. In fact, she’s the niece of the Ocean City’s television station’s chief executive. Her name is Shen Weiwei.”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan had a smug-like tone in his voice.</p> <p>He told Lin Nuan everything about what he heard his morning, including the unexpected audio recording and how Lin Nuan struck Shen Weiwei’s face in front of everybody—and then brushed it off like nothing had even happened.</p> <p>“Why are you after this type of girl, the type covered with thorns? A woman’s priority is to be pretty, nice, and aware of the bigger picture. Even better when she’s emotionally intelligent and thoughtful. But women like this, who are stubborn and unique to their core; they’re the hardest to crack.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an smoked his cigarette, not saying a word.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan continued, “Tang Zheng came across a girl like that. She’d call him tacky if he sent her cars or bags and call him vile if he proposed spending a night together. In their eyes, finding a woman to relieve yourself of your natural needs is a violation to love. They’re never willing when you’re in the mood, and even Thumbelina is unfaithful and a degenerate in their eyes when it comes to relationships. So why are you making life harder for yourself, Fu Brother?”</p>",
  "Chapter 53: How Could Lin Nuan Ask About the Issue?": "<p>The men’s talk was blunt without a care in the world.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan wasn’t the type to meddle in his friend’s business. The reason he repeatedly tried to convince Fu Huai’an to give up on Lin Nuan was that he himself had seen Tang Zheng move all the way to America because of a rocky relationship—and he was worried for Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“If you have so much free time, there’s no need to do so much research on a woman. Maybe you can think about how you’re going to converse with Huanyu’s boss.” Fu Huai’an flicked his cigarette, his tone not changing one bit.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan shut his mouth knowingly at Fu Huai’an’s response.</p> <p>“If there’s nothing else, you can leave to finish your work first.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan shut her eyes in the car but her ears were still listening.</p> <p>After some time, Fu Huai’an walked over to the car door.</p> <p><em>“Tap tap tap—”</em></p> <p>She heard the sound of knuckles gently knocking against the glass window.</p> <p>Lin Nuan hands tensed as she looked up, unable to fake a sleepy appearance.</p> <p>She looked at Fu Huai’an with clear eyes through the glass window. Her head dropped down sheepishly as she grabbed her square purse and Fu Huai’an’s suit while gesturing that she was about to open the door.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an took a step back and walked back to their condo first. He keyed in the password for the door’s passcode lock.</p> <p>Lin Nuan got off the car. As she locked the car door, she hesitated.</p> <p>She originally intended to wait outside and let Fu Huai’an bring out her identity card.</p> <p>But there was no way she could bring herself to ask him that. It would sound as if Wen Moshen’s return was what made her decide not to collect their marriage certificate anymore—like she was kicking Fu Huai’an to the curb when he had outlived his usefulness.</p> <p>Lin Nuan did intend to keep certain promises, but for a matter with such significance like collecting the certificate, it was very difficult for her to ask when Fu Huai’an didn’t bring it up again at all.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s suit was still in her arms and she still had the keys. She collected herself and entered the door together with him.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an took off his vest as he entered the door, his shirt sleeves rolled to his elbow, revealing his built, muscular arms.</p> <p>He loosened a few buttons near his shirt collar. Standing in front of the fridge, he grabbed a bottle of water, tilted his head up and took a few sips, his Adam’s apple gliding underneath the collar. He looked manlier than ever.</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood there in silence after she switched into her slippers.</p> <p>“Your identity card is in the master bedroom upstairs, right on the table…” Fu Huai’an closed the refrigerator door, his calm eyes turning to Lin Nuan as he said, “You can find the master bedroom, right?”</p> <p>Of course, she could find it. She didn’t know if she was being too suspicious, but she felt Fu Huai’an had ulterior motives when he said “master bedroom”—as if he wanted to remind her of the night of their interaction right there.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an simply stated it with a straight face. If Lin Nuan kept acting weird about it it would make her look overly sensitive.</p> <p>She placed his suit on the sofa arm and the car keys on the table. She stated, “Then… I’ll go get my identity card.”</p> <p>“Okay.” Fu Huai’an looked up.</p> <p>Watching Lin Nuan go upstairs, Fu Huai’an put down the bottle and unhurriedly lit up a cigarette. Once again, he narrowed his eyes in the smoke and moved the eye-catching identity card on the dressing table to the top of the refrigerator,</p> <p>On the second floor.</p> <p>As she entered the bedroom, Lin Nuan’s ears burned when she saw the huge bed with its gray bed sheets on it. She directed her eyes towards the table with the identity card on it. She was feeling so guilty that she only wanted to leave asap. Without even taking a proper look, she snatched the card, shoved it in her bag and took off.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an sat on the sofa downstairs biting the cigarette in the corner of his mouth. He was reading a document in his hands while angrily scolding somebody on the phone in his deep voice, giving off an imposing impression.</p>",
  "Chapter 54 - She’ll Be Downstairs in Twenty Minutes": "<p>Chapter 54: She’ll Be Downstairs in Twenty Minutes<br/>\nTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios</p> <p>Hearing Lin Nuan’s footsteps on the stairs, Fu Huai’an glanced towards her direction and said in a milder tone, “Pick somebody else.”</p> <p>By the time he hung up the phone, Lin Nuan had already reached the first floor. She said, “Mr. Fu, if there’s nothing else then I’ll be on my way.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an nodded.</p> <p>The cold breeze greeted her as she walked out of his condo. She finally felt the temperature of her face drop.</p> <p>Lin Nuan walked out of the condominium neighborhood and got into a cab. She gave the driver her neighborhood’s address.</p> <p>Looking at the dark sky outside, she thought about how Fu Huai’an had never disagreed to anything Lu Jinnan had said in their talk earlier today. A troubled expression spread across her face.</p> <p>Perhaps Fu Huai’an thought the same—that’s why he never mentioned collecting the marriage certificate again.</p> <p>After all, Fu Huai’an had no other reason to marry her other than the fact that Tuan Tuan saw her as his mother.</p> <p>Maybe the majority of men were similar to Lu Jinnan. They were fundamentally players, and they saw women as trophies, as if the more they conquered the more it showed how much charm they had.</p> <p>If they weren’t players it was only because they didn’t have enough wealth or looks. But once a man had a decent amount of the two, they wouldn’t be the exception—not even Lin Nuan’s father in the Lin Family.</p> <p>Judging solely from how smooth and experienced Fu Huai’an was that night when he flirted with her, he definitely wasn’t as held back and restrained as the public persona that the media crafted of him.</p> <p>Like attracts like…</p> <p>If he was socializing with somebody like Lu Jinnan, how much character could he himself have?</p> <p>Perhaps Fu Huai’an thought her type was unable to tolerate his superficial flings, and so he decided to give up on the thought of marrying her.</p> <p>Lin Nuan took a shower after she reached home. She had a nice good sleep. By the time she woke up, it was already evening.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt a bit thirsty and hot as the bedcovers were too thick.</p> <p>Her WeChat kept sending in notifications. She searched for her phone on the bed and unlocked it as she lay back.</p> <p> </p> <p>It was the Stars Neighbourhood’s rental group. They were complaining and questioning the management on why the electricity hadn’t come back on after being fixed for two hours.</p> <p>She rolled over and tried to switch on her lamp. The electricity was indeed not working.</p> <p>She used the dim light from her phone to get up but she accidentally knocked over her square purse on the table chair. The contents inside spilled over.</p> <p>As Lin Nuan bent over to pick them up, the whole room lit up. Fu Huai’an name popped up before her eyes on the identity document she was holding. Her narrowed eyes suddenly grew huge.</p> <p>She turned another page and saw Fu Tuan Tuan’s name. She finally confirmed that she’d taken the wrong identity document.</p> <p>She smacked her forehead. Why didn’t she take a good look at it when she took it?</p> <p>Lin Nuan hesitated for a long time before finally deciding to dial Fu Huai’an’s number.</p> <p>She answered the phone. Fu Huai’an didn’t say anything on the other end so she broke the silence first, “Mr. Fu, my apologies, I took the wrong identity card.”</p> <p> </p> <p>“Where are you?” Fu Huai’an asked.</p> <p>“Stars Neighbourhood.”</p> <p>“Be downstairs in twenty minutes…”</p> <p>He hung up the phone without giving Lin Nuan a chance to respond.</p> <p>She looked down at the identity card in her hands and blamed herself for being so careless.</p> <p>She knew Fu Huai’an was always punctual. She waited for fifteen minutes then slipped on a gray hoodie and went downstairs.</p> <p>The moment she walked out the elevator she saw a black Bentley parked at the door of her apartment.</p> <p>She recognized it as Fu Huai’an’s car. She briskly walked to the car but found that it was empty inside.</p> <p>The phone in her blouse pocket vibrated. She took it out and saw Fu Huai’an’s contact ID. As she picked up the phone she heard his deep voice at the other end, “Open the door…”</p>",
  "Chapter 55: Is There Tea in the House?": "<p>Fu Huai’an tone was amicable yet Lin Nuan felt that it carried an air of authority.</p> <p>When a man is used to being in power, his authority and strong presence would naturally be shown through his words and actions.</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood next to the black Bentley. Her legs could still vaguely feel the heat coming from the car.</p> <p>She guessed that Fu Huai’an must have arrived earlier and taken the elevator up to see her, while she was coincidentally taking the other elevator down.</p> <p>She didn’t have the courage to ask him to come down again when she was downstairs. She had troubled him to come all the way here because she took the wrong identity document. How could she burden him to run upstairs and down for her?</p> <p>Lin Nuan held the identity document in her hands and tucked her messy windswept strands of hair behind her ear. As she walked inside, she said, “I’m coming right up…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>As Lin Nuan came out of the elevator, she saw Fu Huai’an in his suit, standing against the backlight of the two elevators. He was smoking in front of the trash bin with an ashtray on top of it.</p> <p>He kept one hand in his pocket while his cigar-wielding hand was checking his email on his phone. He had a look of concentration on his face.</p> <p>As their eyes met, Fu Huai’an’s tall and slender figure gave off an imposing vibe.</p> <p>They weren’t too far apart. Lin Nuan could vaguely detect the scent of alcohol on Fu Huai’an’s body.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had stood next to the car for a while and she knew there wasn’t a driver in it. She recalled the faint noise she heard on the other end of the line in their call and guessed he must have been out drinking with colleagues.</p> <p>He put out his cigar in the ashtray on top of the trash bin. Judging by the identity documents she was holding in her hands, he knew that she’d left early and gone downstairs to wait for him.</p> <p>“Is there tea in the house?” Fu Huai’an asked in a deep, resonating voice with a hint of cordiality.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an drove over despite having consumed alcohol; it wouldn’t be polite for Lin Nuan to deny him a simple cup of tea.</p> <p>She nodded and led Fu Huai’an through the doorway.</p> <p>With the furry carpet on the floor of her living room, she decided to get a pair of slippers from the shoe shelf for Fu Huai’an to change into. She bent down to search for one and realized she’d never had male guests come over, thus the slippers’ sizes were way too small. She mulled over the problem and put them back on the shelf.</p> <p>Seeing that Fu Huai’an was still standing by the door, she said to him, “I don’t have any suitable slippers for you here, just come in…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an nodded and strolled into the living room with a calm expression.</p> <p>Lin Nuan went to the kitchen to make a cup of tea for Fu Huai’an. The Wu Yi Mountain Red Cloak Tea that Liang Mulan brought last time came into good use.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an took a look at the small table and realized the photo of Lin Nuan hugging that big chubby cat was gone.</p> <p>He then glanced towards Lin Nuan in the kitchen boiling a kettle of water and looking for the tea. She was wearing a light blue hoodie and jeans, her sleeves rolled up as she stood on her toes, struggling to reach the box of tea on top of the shelf.</p> <p>“Let me help you.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s voice traveled over her head. Her whole body froze. She felt that warm wall behind her and her heart couldn’t help beating faster.</p> <p>She looked up and watched as his muscular hands retrieved the tea box. As he turned, the fringe on her forehead unintentionally brushed over his chin. She unconsciously took a step back, her bottom pressed up against the countertop.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s large hands immediately grasped her by her back to prevent the back of her head colliding into the shelves above.</p> <p>Every single time she was alone with Fu Huai’an, Lin Nuan had nowhere to hide her awkwardness.</p> <p>The kitchen wasn’t that big to begin with, so Fu Huai’an’s presence only made it appear even more crowded.</p> <p>At that moment, their bodies were glued together in an ambiguous position. Lin Nuan’s heart began to race as if it was going to jump out of her chest.</p> <p>His masculine, alcohol-tinged breath lingered over her forehead and made it tingle.</p>",
  "Chapter 56: What’s the Panic For?": "<p>In the silent and still kitchen, all you could hear was the gentle whistling sounds coming from the brewing kettle.</p> <p>Her elbow was propped up between the two of them. Her palms were beginning to sweat.</p> <p>At eye level, she could clearly see Fu Huai’an’s open shirt collar as he moved to embrace her. His defined muscles were vaguely revealed. Lin Nuan immediately averted her eyes and stared at the floor, her fair ears turning as red as a tomato.</p> <p>“What’s the panic for?”</p> <p>Smiling, Fu Huai’an asked in a low voice. A voice like that in a space occupied by only two people only appeared more alluring than ever.</p> <p>The mature and imposing aura of the man enveloped her whole body—she was so nervous she couldn’t breathe properly.</p> <p>She tried to play it cool and ask Fu Huai’an to move, but her throat was so dry she felt as if she was being choked, unable to say a single word. All she could do was keep her head down unnaturally with her arms pushed up against Fu Huai’an’s chest.</p> <p>“You afraid of me?” Fu Huai’an stared deeply into her eyes and asked.</p> <p>“No…” Lin Nuan denied.</p> <p>To back up her own claim, she forced herself to look up and stare into Fu Huai’an’s eyes. Her heart started beating faster and faster.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an saw the stubborn yet unconcealable shy look in Lin Nuan’s eyes. With one hand against the countertop and another propped up against the hanging shelves, he bent over slightly and lowered his head, moving closer and closer to Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s eyelashes were trembling. She tried to stand straight in order not to display any sign of fear in front of Fu Huai’an, but she was trembling inside.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s large hands held her face as his arched nose playfully tapped against Lin Nuan’s nose. It was uncertain whether it was because of the alcohol, but his deep black eyes looked as if they hid an ocean of affection underneath them.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s heart fell into a trance, her mind going bank.</p> <p>His thumb gently caressed Lin Nuan’s tender lips.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s feet were unstable yet her body was held firmly in place by Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>The irrational desire inside her was awakened as Fu Huai’an’s fingers slowly caressed her lips.</p> <p>Intense shame occupied Lin Nuan’s heart. She uneasily moved her head back…</p> <p><em>“Dong—”</em></p> <p>Lin Nuan’s head did bang against the hanging shelf as Fu Huai’an expected, but she couldn’t sense any pain.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face burned even more when she realized that she’d just knocked against the back of Fu Huai’an’s hand.</p> <p>“You let a man in your house this late, and now you’re realizing it was a mistake?” His soft lips whispered as he kept a calm expression on his face.</p> <p>She didn’t deny it that time.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face was burning red under the warm lights. Her chest was heaving because of her overwhelming nervousness and shame, accentuating the beautiful curves of her slender, fair neck. Fu Huai’an gulped, apparently moved by the sight of her.</p> <p>Hearing the whistling sound of the kettle boiling, Fu Huai’an moved back and whipped out a cigar box from his pocket. He took out a cigar and placed it in the corner of his mouth. Suddenly he said, “So I heard you got into a fight with your makeup artist today?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an didn’t go overboard. Lin Nuan held it in and didn’t say anything as she opened the tea box and began loading it with tea leaves. “I did.”</p> <p>She heard the sound of a lighter lighting up a cigar from behind her. Lin Nuan raised the kettle and began pouring water into the teacup.</p> <p>“It’s too hot. Do you have bottled water in the fridge?” Beneath his arched brows, Fu Huai’an’s unfathomable eyes looked calmer than ever.</p> <p>Lin Nuan nodded without moving.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an leaned on the countertop in the crowded kitchen, blocking Lin Nuan’s way to the fridge.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an drew back his long legs. Lin Nuan then walked over to the fridge to fetch a bottle of cool water and passed it to him.</p> <p>He took the bottle with the cigar still in his fingers. Opening the cap he took a few sips and asked, “How much did you overhear from my conversation with Lu Jinnan’s today?”</p>",
  "Chapter 57: A Sudden Confession": "<p>She didn’t expect Fu Huai’an to ask so bluntly and with such an assured tone. She paused for a short while, shocked, then uneasily tucked her hair behind her ear as she awkwardly averted her eyes. “I heard everything…”</p> <p>As soon as she recalled how Lu Jinnan told Fu Huai’an she was “the difficult type”, her ears grew hot.</p> <p>Perhaps in the eyes of men like Lu Jinnan and Fu Huai’an, women would be willing to give their bodies to them when they needed relief.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an placed the bottle of water next to the warm cup of tea. He tilted his face and flicked his cigar in the trash bin next to the sink, his profile appearing even more defined under the warm lights of the kitchen.</p> <p>“Did it ever cross your mind that Wong Ling is old enough to be an elder of the Ocean City channel? It’s not like she doesn’t have any support behind her… so why would she send bags and makeup to a nameless makeup artist?”</p> <p>The smoke traveled out of Fu Huai’an’s lips and dissipated into the air, still unable to cover his piercing eyes.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had never thought about it. In fact, she unconsciously felt that Shen Weiwei was intentionally lying in front of her to get some kind of benefit—until Lin Nuan heard Lu Jinnan mentioning that Shen Weiwei was the niece of the chief director in charge.</p> <p>“Did you really think you did a good job this morning, that you managed to protect your dignity despite the cruel ways of society and prevent yourself from being taken advantage of?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan had undeniably thought so.</p> <p>Being brought up by Liang Mulan, she was proud and dignified to her core. Therefore, she was unwilling to bend to certain degenerate societal practices. She didn’t like to fight with people or reveal that she had the Lin Family supporting her; all she wanted was to preserve and protect herself.</p> <p>She felt uncomfortable at having herself being read like a book by Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan unable to give a response, Fu Huai’an continued to say, “You are decently smart, but your emotional intelligence is dismal.”</p> <p>That was Fu Huai’an’s conclusion of Lin Nuan’s character.</p> <p>Lin Nuan furrowed her eyebrows in obvious disagreement to Fu Huai’an’s words, “It was never in my nature to be a social butterfly.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an proceeded to say in a deep voice, “So you didn’t even have the courage to discuss with me about not collecting the marriage certificate that day?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s throat suddenly choked up.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s tall and slender figure leaned on the countertop. A grounded and distinguished presence radiated from his whole being.</p> <p>The crowded kitchen was devastatingly silent. All that was stirring was the smoke at Fu Huai’an’s fingertips.</p> <p>His broad shoulders blocked some of the light. His deep eyes gazed at Lin Nuan, revealing an unreadable quality.</p> <p>After a considerable amount of time, Lin Nuan watched all the smoke dissipate from the cigar in Fu Huai’an’s fingers and said, “You didn’t send Tuan Tuan over here last night and let me take back my identity document. I thought you didn’t plan on collecting it anymore.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan thought that Fu Huai’an had chosen to give up on collecting the certificate with her because she was certain that he felt she was the “difficult type”, and because he was unable to accept disloyalty in a marriage, especially after hearing what Lu Jinnan had discussed with Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, I actually like you—a lot.” Fu Huai’an’s dark eyes glanced at Lin Nuan. He put out the cigar in his hand and slipped another one into the corner of his mouth.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s voice was calm, his deep, mature inflection sounding magnetic, causing Lin Nuan’s heart to race uncontrollably once again.</p> <p>The sudden confession swept Lin Nuan off her feet. Beads of sweat formed on her hands.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked down and lit up his cigar. The corner of his mouth curved up as he looked at her through the smoke with a serious expression.</p> <p>She uneasily tucked her hair behind her ear and her face flushed, betraying her yet again.</p>",
  "Chapter 58: Fu Huai’an Gave Lin Nuan a Lesson": "<p>Sensing the smile on Fu Huai’an’s lips, Lin Nuan grew increasingly uneasy, and her heart was feeling like a tangled mess.</p> <p>Lin Nuan did not feel repulsed by Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Just then, when their bodies had pressed closely together, and with Fu Huai’an’s thumb that smelled of cigarettes rubbing her lips, Lin Nuan’s heart… did flutter.</p> <p>She clenched her fists tightly, unwilling to admit her own feelings.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an had always been experienced. Lin Nuan cynically guessed that “like” was a word Fu Huai’an used to trick women into his bedsheets.</p> <p>His thin lips parted once more, saying, “I also like the feeling of having s*x with you…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face was completely burning up as her fists tightened. Suddenly, she felt that Fu Huai’an’s directness was horrible, without the slightest bit of consideration for the feelings of others.</p> <p>Her heart was in a mess. Hearing the word s*x, her mind automatically replayed the night where she felt pain and pleasure under Fu Huai’an’s body. She felt heat pooling at her abdomen, the rush that her body felt that night seemed to be re-appearing.</p> <p>A strong sense of shame covered Lin Nuan’s whole heart.</p> <p>In front of Fu Huai’an, she only felt awkward and tense.</p> <p>The next moment, she was covered by a shadow. When she raised her head… her body was circled by a warm wall and something hot pressed against her lips—Fu Huai’an’s lips kissed hers with its cigarette scent.</p> <p>Inside his embrace, all Lin Nuan could smell was Fu Huai’an’s strong and mature scent, the heat in her body obviously rising while her head started to turn to mush. Her arms were stuck between them and her head felt numb as her body’s muscles tensed up.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s eyelids were half-closed as his dark gaze focused on Lin Nuan’s expression. Taking advantage of the moment she blanked out… Fu Huai’an’s tongue pried her lips and teeth open, bringing with him the bitterness of nicotine.</p> <p>The man’s breath instantly invaded Lin Nuan’s heart and lungs.</p> <p>The sudden kiss shocked her and her legs turned to jelly, unable to stand up… After some messy shuffling, she was guided by Fu Huai’an and pressed onto the fridge.</p> <p>The whole kitchen was filled with the sounds of their wet kissing.</p> <p>The embarrassment immediately made Lin Nuan return to her senses…</p> <p>She tried to struggle and resist, her arms pushing outwards in an attempt to push Fu Huai’an away.</p> <p>But women had biologically less strength than men—how could she push Fu Huai’an away?</p> <p>Sensing Lin Nuan’s resistance, Fu Huai’an used one hand to hold her face and kissed even deeper, and more gently…</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s heart was a mess and she was unable to fight back, her struggles dissolving in front of Fu Huai’an. She could only let him do what he wanted with her.</p> <p>Their tongues danced and Lin Nuan was clearly not Fu Huai’an’s opponent. His lasting kiss finished up the last bit of oxygen in Lin Nuan’s lungs, making her resistance turn weak, and she was only able to cling onto Fu Huai’an’s shirt.</p> <p>Perhaps it was because of the lack of oxygen, but her whole body started trembling.</p> <p>Even worse, Lin Nuan’s desire was actually stirred up by the kiss and she was melting into a puddle in Fu Huai’an’s embrace.</p> <p>His slightly rough hand was burning hot as it snaked around Lin Nuan’s waist… He pressed her waist closer to himself to let her feel his desire towards her.</p> <p>How scary was it to invite a wolf into your home? Today, Fu Huai’an had given Lin Nuan a lesson.</p> <p>Just as Lin Nuan was about to suffocate, Fu Huai’an finally released her.</p> <p>After a short moment of panting, Lin Nuan pushed Fu Huai’an away as one of her hands secretly held onto the counter to support her body. She ended up accidentally knocking over the milk she hadn’t finished in the afternoon and had forgotten to keep in the fridge.</p> <p>Even though she was unwilling to admit it, she indeed could not handle Fu Huai’an’s kisses.</p>",
  "Chapter 59: Lin Nuan Felt Both Panic and Fear in Her Heart": "<p>Before she could chase him out, Fu Huai’an’s warm body pressed down again. He slipped one arm around Lin Nuan’s waist while the other pressed onto the cabinet above them to prevent her from hitting her head, delivering an even more intense kiss…</p> <p>When the man pressed over her, Lin Nuan had one hand supporting her body on the counter while the other was held up between them as her body leaned back. She could only remain on the receiving end, her guarded heart and body gradually overwhelmed.</p> <p>Their bodies pressed tightly together with only Lin Nuan’s slender arm in front of Fu Huai’an’s chest.</p> <p>Under the shirt, Fu Huai’an’s body felt like it was burning up; his solid muscles and strong heartbeat made Lin Nuan’s face burn and her heart race.</p> <p>The spilt milk was dripping down from the counter and Lin Nuan, leaning on the counter, felt her pants getting soaked in the milk while there was a puddle under her palm.</p> <p>Once more lacking in oxygen, Lin Nuan’s brain was currently turning into mush.</p> <p>She couldn’t neglect her body, and its reaction towards Fu Huai’an’s kiss.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt both panic and fear in her heart!</p> <p>Bedroom affairs, she had only experienced it once.</p> <p>The feeling of getting tangled up with Fu Huai’an was carved into her heart like a tattoo; even the slightest ruffle would bring it up, making Lin Nuan’s body involuntarily welcome him.</p> <p>Even if she knew that it would be too late if they continued, her weak pushes felt more like she was being a tease.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s desire had clearly been stirred up too.</p> <p>These past years, there have been no woman by Fu Huai’an’s side. As a normal, straight adult man, his sex life was so bland and empty that even Lu Jinnan was doubtful of Fu Huai’an’s sexual orientation.</p> <p>There had been sexy and mature women around him, and even pure and cute ones, but no one could give Fu Huai’an the same feeling that Lin Nuan’s shyness did.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s phone vibrated in his pocket. The ringing of the familiar melody woke Lin Nuan up from her trance and she pushed Fu Huai’an away with both of her hands, her milk-stained right hand dirtying Fu Huai’an’s shirt…</p> <p>Letting go of Lin Nuan’s kiss-swollen lips, Fu Huai’an’s breathing was heavy. Lin Nuan’s breaths, on the other hand, were quick pants, her face as red as a tomato.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s lustful gaze stared at Lin Nuan, burning to the point where she felt uneasy.</p> <p>Her trembling hand pressed against Fu Huai’an’s chest, she dropped her gaze and looked away, lacking the courage to look directly at Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an didn’t remove his arm from Lin Nuan’s waist. With furrowed brows, he took a look at his phone and picked up, speaking with a slightly hoarse voice, “Speak.”</p> <p>Hearing the anger in Fu Huai’an’s voice, Lu Jinnan paused for a moment, asking, “Why are you so furious? Who offended our Great Lawyer Fu?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan could hear Lu Jinnan’s voice since she was in close proximity to the phone. She lowered her head and pushed Fu Huai’an away with force, afraid to hear Lu Jinnan say any more dirty jokes…</p> <p>Detecting Lin Nuan’s refusal, Fu Huai’an let go.</p> <p>Lin Nuan walked out of the kitchen and into the bathroom, making sure to lock the door before she turned the tap on and washed away the sticky milk on her hands.</p> <p>The icy cold water rushed onto her palms and gradually cooled the heat stirred up in Lin Nuan’s body.</p> <p>Raising her head, the mirror reflected her red and swollen lips.</p> <p>She raised her hand to gently touch her lips, and it hurt…</p> <p>Her entire mouth was filled with that man’s taste!</p> <p>Thinking of the long and intense kiss in the kitchen just before, Lin Nuan’s heart started beating faster once more.</p> <p>After more than 20 years, Lin Nuan’s first kiss and virginity were both given to the same man!</p> <p>She didn’t know if everyone’s bodies had the same reaction when kissing with the opposite sex, but she clearly remembered… In the second year of middle school, when she was kissed on the cheek by a mischievous boy in class, she was so disgusted and repulsed that she washed her face more than ten times when she reached home, her skin rubbed so red it took days to recover.</p>",
  "Chapter 60: Why Not Come Out To Get To Know Each Other?": "<p>But towards Fu Huai’an’s kiss, not only did she not feel disgusted, she even reacted shamelessly!</p> <p>Under the flow of the clear water, Lin Nuan bit her lips harshly and washed her hands until they turned red.</p> <p>Inside the kitchen, Fu Huai’an’s eyes stared at the milk dripping onto the floor as he took out a cigarette and lit it up. After placing his lighter back, he stuck his hand into his pocket so that his body’s reaction wasn’t as obvious.</p> <p>“So Huan Yu’s side no longer has any issues…”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan finished speaking but didn’t get Fu Huai’an’s response, so he added, “I saw that Old Qi’s company signed a new model recently. Her looks and personality aren’t bad and she’s even slightly similar to Lin Nuan. From the way she moves, she gives off a fresh appearance and looks pretty clean. Why not come out to get to know each other?”</p> <p>Hearing the sound of the bathroom door opening, Fu Huai’an’s gaze swept to that side and he replied, “If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up…”</p> <p>“Hey… Old Fu?!”</p> <p>By the time Fu Huai’an hung up the call, he had already recovered more or less.</p> <p>He walked out from the kitchen and saw Lin Nuan holding a cloth and a mop. Guessing that Lin Nuan was going to clean the kitchen, his long legs stepped away, giving way to the kitchen entrance.</p> <p>Lin Nuan started cleaning up in the kitchen. The right side of her pants was still wet since she couldn’t change it in time, nor did she want to change when Fu Huai’an was still around.</p> <p>Even though it was her home, Fu Huai’an’s presence made Lin Nuan exceptionally uncomfortable.</p> <p>Throwing the carton of milk into the bin, Lin Nuan wiped up the milk on the counter with the cloth before using up quite a few pieces of the kitchen’s paper towels to absorb the milk on the floor…</p> <p>Using a mop to wipe up spilled milk on the floor wouldn’t make the floor clean. It would instead make the floor slippery and sticky. That was a piece of lifestyle knowledge that Lin Nuan gained only after leaving the Lin family.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an leaned against the doorframe watching Lin Nuan, his gaze deep and focused.</p> <p>Lin Nuan bent her body and cleaned with sharp and fast actions. Perhaps because Fu Huai’an was standing at the door, Lin Nuan did not want to have her back facing him—she felt that it was dangerous to expose her back to Fu Huai’an, so she dragged the mop inwards.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an watched as her slim legs crossed over backward as she mopped the floor, unaware that the beautiful scenery in front of her chest was completely revealed to Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s gaze darkened and he took a deep drag of the cigarette, white smoke rising from the corner of his mouth.</p> <p>The gentle and domestic Lin Nuan gave people a comfortable feeling of stability.</p> <p>After mopping the kitchen, Lin Nuan straightened up and with her hand holding onto the mop as though it gave her strength, said, “Mr. Fu… It’s getting late.”</p> <p>Chasing him away right after kissing him, Fu Huai’an narrowed his eyes and used the hand that was holding his cigarette to point at the cup of tea on the counter. It still had steam rising from it.</p> <p>“I have yet to drink my tea…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan held on tighter to the mop. Drinking tea was the reason Fu Huai’an used to enter her home. It seemed like he wasn’t going to leave until he drank his tea.</p> <p>“Then please excuse me…” Lin Nuan prepared herself to exit the room.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an remained unmoving by the door, saying, “You’re wet…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face turned completely red in an instant, burning up intensely.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an sensed Lin Nuan’s gaze turning guarded as she tightened her red face with embarrassment, and he said, “I meant… your pants are wet.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s words clearly showed that he knew what Lin Nuan had thought of, and it made Lin Nuan’s face grow hotter…</p> <p>“I know!” Lin Nuan clenched her fists around the mop, her expression that of embarrassment from being seen through by Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“Not going to change?” Fu Huai’an asked, still refusing to let her leave.</p> <p>“I’ll change once you leave later.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan even dropped her respectful tone, clearly furious.</p>",
  "Chapter 61: Didn’t You Have Some Feelings Too": "<p>Their gazes met and Lin Nuan panicked from being seen through Fu Huai’an, her heart thumping irregularly.</p> <p>She looked away in discomfort and looked towards the cup of tea that was still giving off hot steam, but she was afraid Fu Huai’an would see her cowardice, so she pretended to calmly look towards Fu Huai’an again.</p> <p>After adjusting her emotions, Lin Nuan wanted to let Fu Huai’an go to the living room first and she would bring the tea over after him.</p> <p>But having just been passionately kissed by Fu Huai’an earlier on, speaking in a nice tone… Lin Nuan could not bring herself to do it.</p> <p>Both parties remained at a standstill, Lin Nuan’s whole body clearly expressing her excessive awkwardness and embarrassment.</p> <p>She had never been good at handling romantic relationships, let alone when she was faced with an experienced man like Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>At this time, Fu Huai’an’s phone rang.</p> <p>“Yes…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an picked up the call and walked towards the living room.</p> <p>The tight kitchen became much wider after Fu Huai’an’s exit, followed by Lin Nuan’s heart as it relaxed with relief.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s deep and gentle voice traveled from the living room and Lin Nuan could make out that it was Tuan Tuan on the other end of the line.</p> <p>It was probably because the child and Auntie Li were staying overnight at the hospital, and he couldn’t get used to it at night and missed Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“Staying one night in the hospital for observation was the doctor’s request. You’re no longer a one or two-year-old, you should know that doctors make professional judgments for their patients.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan put back the mop into the bathroom and washed her hands before coming out to see that Fu Huai’an was still standing in the balcony comforting Tuan Tuan. The sliding door was left open and she could hear that while his voice and tone sounded soft and gentle, every single word he said did not sound like he was comforting a child.</p> <p>By the time Fu Huai’an ended the call and returned, Lin Nuan was waiting for him with a bottle of green tea.</p> <p>Under the warm light, Lin Nuan’s gentle and defined face remained taut and her slim neck displayed an elegant line. She reached out her hand and raised the green tea in Fu Huai’an’s direction, clearly chasing him out of her home.</p> <p>“The tea leaves I have here aren’t very good. And Mr. Fu is so busy, you shouldn’t have time to wait here at my home for the tea to cool.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked down at Lin Nuan and remained silent.</p> <p>According to common sense, Lin Nuan should currently be using her mop to chase away the man who entered her home and touched her…</p> <p>However, she was guilty because of the reaction she had when Fu Huai’an kissed her; she was unable to react too excessively in front of him.</p> <p>And facing a mature and experienced Fu Huai’an, Lin Nuan instinctively felt fear.</p> <p>He had a strong domineering aura that had been trained from years of experience in society, his mature and sturdy look was incomparable for girls like Lin Nuan who were young and lacked experience.</p> <p>Towards a Fu Huai’an who knew so much about the ways of society, Lin Nuan subconsciously felt that all of her tricks would be easily seen through by Fu Huai’an, so no matter what she did she would be at a disadvantage.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s way of chasing him out was smart; she had given Fu Huai’an a way out and most people would have left after taking the green tea, but the person Lin Nuan was facing was not most people!</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s gaze swept across the green tea in Lin Nuan’s raised hands. He looked at her with a serious expression before calmly saying in a deep voice, “That kiss just now, didn’t you have some feelings too?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face turned red upon Fu Huai’an’s words, the hand holding onto the green tea subconsciously tightening and she regretted not splashing the tea onto the man’s face.</p> <p>A feeling of shame engulfed Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Her anger was because Fu Huai’an’s words hit the exact target; her anger and shame were all because of herself.</p> <p>Unable to show her rage when facing Fu Huai’an, Lin Nuan felt grievance collecting in her heart and the rims of her eyes reddened, but she stubbornly glared at the other man.</p>",
  "Chapter 62: What Right Do You Have to Accuse Others of Acting Frivolous?": "<p>Fu Huai’an flicked his cigar and raised his long legs, walking towards Lin Nuan’s direction.</p> <p>Lin Nuan nervously and unconsciously took a step back, but as soon as she did she realized it made her look too timid. She straightened her back and stood there stiffly, clutching the green tea in her hands.</p> <p>Studying her tense body and flushed face, Fu Huai’an stopped when he was just a step away from her. He lowered his voice and said, “Lin Nuan, do you think I really came here in the middle of the night to drink your green tea?”</p> <p>They were both adults. Fu Huai’an assumed that Lin Nuan would be aware of the implication of a single woman letting a single man into her house at such a late hour.</p> <p>However, Lin Nuan was so sadly inexperienced in her relationships that she never thought of it that way. She began to panic upon Fu Huai’an’s interrogation. Apparently, she’d been careless…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s matter-of-fact words appeared so intimidating; her whole body went stiff and she didn’t know what to do.</p> <p>After a long, dead pause, she asked, “You didn’t come to exchange identity cards?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan asked using a rhetorical question, clearly indicating to Fu Huai’an that she didn’t see the matter in the wrong light.</p> <p>Upon hearing her response, Fu Huai’an grinned and smiled with his eyes. He answered calmly and slowly in his deep, collected voice, “Lin Nuan, it’s not like we haven’t done it before. You should be well aware of my interest in you, or are you simply playing dumb with me?”</p> <p>He took a step towards Lin Nuan as she took a step back. Her legs bumped against the single sofa chair, nearly causing her to trip—especially when she heard him say <em>“it’s not like we haven’t done it before” </em>. Her ears felt as hot as a stove.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s heart fell into a trance. She stubbornly stood up straight and leaned back to maintain some distance between them, the muscles in her calves beginning to ache.</p> <p>Her eyelashes were trembling and she could see Fu Huai’an’s shirt buttons at eye level. She turned her head.</p> <p>They were very close together. Lin Nuan could even smell the faint scent of alcohol on Fu Huai’an’s body.</p> <p>“Will you feel wronged if you do it with me?” Fu Huai’an asked.</p> <p>Lin Nuan mustered up her courage to look at Fu Huai’an straight in the eye, “Mr. Fu, who do you think I am? A woman that will casually sleep with you?”</p> <p>“Would I casually collect a certificate with any woman?” Fu Huai’an asked with one hand in his pocket.</p> <p>Lin Nuan choked up.</p> <p>She was so focused on her anger that she failed to realize that in Fu Huai’an’s eyes, she did indeed “casually” climb into his bed.</p> <p>Even if there was a legitimate reason, it was indeed too casual. After all, she hadn’t known Fu Huai’an for that long.</p> <p>The shame in Lin Nuan’s heart multiplied.</p> <p>Casual… Lin Nuan tried to accuse Fu Huai’an of it but she ended up calling herself out.</p> <p>She was so embarrassed she wanted to turn around and run away, but it was her home.</p> <p>She arduously calmed herself down and looked up at him with reddened eyes…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an stood before her in his shirt with his clearly defined, slender, long hands, the smoke drifting through his fingertips. His shirt had the milk stains left by Lin Nuan, yet it didn’t compromise his imposing and grounded image at all.</p> <p>With the anger burning inside her, she wanted to say something—yet she felt that she had nothing to back up whatever she said in front of Fu Huai’an. After all, she was the one who sought him out first, what right did she have to accuse him of being frivolous with her?</p> <p>The window behind Fu Huai’an revealed the brilliant night view of Ocean City. In the backdrop of that striking background, Fu Huai’ans eyes looked even more striking and unfathomable.</p> <p>“Go change your pants. I’ll take you out to get something to eat.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an grabbed the bottle of green tea from Lin Nuan’s clenched hands, took a step back and leaned over to leave the bottle on the table, leaving Lin Nuan to watch the curvy, defined lines of his sexy back underneath his shirt.</p>",
  "Chapter 63: Don’t Bet on Your Body": "<p>What was it supposed to be—him feeding her a cookie after punching her in the face? Lin Nuan felt that something was off.</p> <p>“I’m not hungry…” Lin Nuan said in a tired voice.</p> <p>After coming back from Fu Huai’an’s place today, Lin Nuan had barely had anything to eat and only took a few sips of milk before dozing off. She had actually felt drained a long while ago.</p> <p>“Don’t bet on your body.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an said as he bit on the cigarette and slipped into the suit draped over the sofa arm. He buttoned up the middle of his suit so that it blocked the spot Lin Nuan had contaminated.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked smart and dashing in his suit. His gaze was calm like water as if he was a completely different person from the threatening man just before.</p> <p>His voice sounded mature, his low register carrying an undeniable air of authority. One couldn’t just speak up and go against him, even if Lin Nuan was resisting him inside.</p> <p>Lin Nuan simply stood there without budging an inch, a stubborn look on her face.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an moved the cigar at the corner of his mouth as he said, “I didn’t bring your identity document. After the meal… you can come over to get it.”</p> <p>As soon as Lin Nuan heard that, alarm bells suddenly went off in her head. She glared Fu Huai’an down as if he were a predator.</p> <p>“Are you afraid of me?” Fu Huai’an asked,</p> <p>The smoke blurred Fu Huai’an’s sharply defined features, appearing as if they had been carved by a master.</p> <p>“No!” Lin Nuan snapped back.</p> <p>“So you don’t want your identity documents?” Fu Huai’an asked calmly, his voice sounding as blunt as ever.</p> <p>Lin Nuan fell silent. The identity document was the Lin Family’s, how could she not want it back?</p> <p>She tucked a few strands of hair behind her ear and looked down rather than into Fu Huai’an’s eyes. She said, “I’ll go collect it another day during the daytime. It’s too late tonight and I have to reach the television station tomorrow by four a.m.”</p> <p>After she had collected herself, Lin Nuan no longer spoke as aggressively.</p> <p>Looking into Lin Nuan’s reddened eyes, Fu Huai’an whipped out the phone in his pocket and dialed a number, supposedly his assistant’s. He gave the name of Lin Nuan’s neighborhood and asked her, “You have any allergies?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was left in shock for a moment. She shook her head.</p> <p>By the time she snapped out of her daze, Fu Huai’an was already done speaking on the phone.</p> <p>As he hung up, he said to Lin Nuan, “Go wash up first. I’ll get somebody to deliver a late night meal to you in fifteen minutes.”</p> <p>Seeing that Fu Huai’an was preparing to take off, she turned and gave way to him.</p> <p>“No worries, I’m actually going to go to bed really soon…” Lin Nuan said in a low voice. She sounded much more amicable because of his kind gesture.</p> <p>With a cool expression, Fu Huai’an put out his cigar in the plastic cup on the table. He asked, “Do you need me to stay and watch you eat?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face flushed as she heard that.</p> <p>It sounded rather frivolous. And yet he sounded so serious as if he really was going to stay back if she continued to decline.</p> <p>She pursed her lips and tried to contain her inner feelings of discomfort and embarrassment. She put on a cool expression and looked Fu Huai’an in the eye. “There’s no need.”</p> <p>The phone in Fu Huai’an’s pocket vibrated again. He answered it as his eyes fell on Tuan Tuan’s luggage case which was apparently still there. He picked it up and walked outside.</p> <p>Lin Nuan noticed his casual tone. It sounded like he was discussing the matter of him suddenly leaving the dinner…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an maintained decent boundaries when he interacted with Lin Nuan. As he didn’t want to say much more to her, he left the house.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an went downstairs and stood by the car. He opened the trunk and placed Tuan Tuan’s cartoon-themed suitcase inside, without hanging up the phone.</p> <p>“Brother Fu, where did you disappear to after you said you went out to take a call?” Tang Zheng asked, laughing, “Did you go to Miss Lin’s place?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an opened the door and sat in the passenger seat. He lit up another cigar and threw the lighter in the storage compartment.</p> <p>“My head hurts. I’m going back to sleep first.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an used his cigar-wielding hand to press the spot between his eyebrows. His deep-seated eyes were half closed, the depths of his eyes looking unfathomable.</p>",
  "Chapter 64: I Won’t Buy It If You Say There’s Nothing Going on in Here": "<p>Fifteen minutes later, the doorbell to Lin Nuan’s home rang.</p> <p>As she opened the door, Fu Huai’an’s assistant, Xiao Lu, was standing outside holding a bag of takeaway food. He smiled politely at Lin Nuan and said, “Miss Lin, your late-night dinner.”</p> <p>Noticing that Xiao Lu was wearing sports attire, she guessed that Fu Huai’an must have let his assistant come here at the last minute.</p> <p>At the thought of that, Lin Nuan reached out to take the plastic bag and smiled awkwardly as she felt guilty inside. “My apologies, troubling you to come all this way just to deliver this.”</p> <p>“No worries. Enjoy your meal, Miss Lin. I’ll be on my way.” Xiao Lu nodded at Lin Nuan and turned around, walking towards the elevator.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt uneasy after she closed the door.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an never mentioned the matter of collecting the certificate again. Lin Nuan couldn’t figure out what he was really thinking about inside.  ( Boxno vel. co m )</p> <p>If Fu Huai’an had really confirmed that he wouldn’t collect the certificate with her, why would he come here in the middle of the night and kiss her, and ask somebody to send her a late-night meal? What was that supposed to mean?</p> <p>He hadn’t brought up the matter despite talking about collecting the certificate.</p> <p>She recalled that call she got from Liang Mulan about eating together and her heart began to beat faster. Her hands tensed up as she clutched the plastic bag. How was she supposed to tell Fu Huai’an? Or how would she break it to Liang Mulan that they didn’t end up collecting their marriage certificate?</p> <p>…</p> <p>By the time Fu Huai’an’s assistant, Xiao Lu, came out of Lin Nuan’s apartment, Fu Huai’an was already sitting in the backseat.</p> <p>His large hands were holding his phone as he engaged in a conversation over the line. His cigar-wielding hand rested on his folded legs. His deep, dark, mysterious eyes stared at the flaming-red end of the cigar. His stare eventually turned into a preoccupied gaze.</p> <p>The car window wasn’t closed yet. The apartment light accentuated the structure of his clearly defined profile.</p> <p>Two girls running back home at night passed by the luxurious car and couldn’t help peeking inside the half-open car window.</p> <p>Inside the car, the masculine aura of the elegantly dressed, mature man made the girls blush and their hearts race.</p> <p>The two girls slowed down and watched him send the cigar to the corner of his mouth. He mumbled something into the phone as the smoke dissipated from his mouth. His powerful presence as a successful man was clear to see.</p> <p>The two girls lowered their voice and argued whether Fu Huai’an was from their neighborhood. A successful man that radiated such masculinity would always have girls falling for him, let alone a man like Fu Huai’an who had exceptional looks and aura.</p> <p>The Lu Jinnan on the other end of the line had left the drinking gathering and sought out a quiet spot. He lit up a cigar and said to Fu Huai’an, “The Fu family’s elder must have noticed there was something off. I just heard Huanyu’s chief executor Luo from the drinking gathering mention that the elder sent Secretary Song to invite Huanyu’s manager out for dinner.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an saw Xiao Lu come out of the apartment from the corner of his eye. Fu Huai’an flicked his cigar without changing his expression. “You think that’s strange?”</p> <p>“Yes…” Lu JInnan said in a heavy tone, “This old guy is always on his high horse, yet this time he actually let Secretary Song personally come invite Huanyu’s manager out for dinner. It’s something that a simple phone call could achieve, yet he invited him out personally. I won’t buy it if you say there isn’t something going on here.”</p> <p>“If there really was something up they wouldn’t be so conspicuous,” Fu Huai’an said calmly.</p> <p>“Brother Fu, you need to count your numbers. This old guy is definitely laying out a path for that wild man outside…”</p> <p>The old guy Lu Jinnan was referring to was Fu Huai’an’s grandfather, Fu Qingquan, the manager of Kai De Cooperation.</p> <p>When Fu Huai’an’s mother Fu Wan was about to marry Jiang Chengyuan, she had a huge fallout with her family. After the marriage, Jiang Chengyuan never received genuine support from the Fu Family, resulting in their relationship eventually falling apart.</p>",
  "Chapter 65: How Many More Years Do You Want to Stay Inside?": "<p>After the divorce, the ambitious Fu Wan was unwilling to come back to the Fu family only to be lectured by her parents about choosing the wrong partner. Thus, she led a life alone with Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>A rough life plus a bumpy relationship eventually prompted depression to insidiously imprison Fu Wan.</p> <p>One morning after Fu Huai’an left home to go to school, Fu Wan chose to take her life in her bathtub.</p> <p>Yet by the time the Fu Family had heard of Fu Wan’s death, Fu Huai’an had already become an influential figure in the lawyer world.</p> <p>Hearing the tragedy that befell his only daughter and that his grandson who shared his blood was not recognized by Jiang Chengyuan, Grandfather Fu and Grandmother Fu let Secretary Song invite Fu Huai’an back to the Fu Family.</p> <p>After meeting up with Fu Huai’an, Grandmother Fu was shocked by Fu Huai’an’s firm aura. Fu Huai’an carried himself immaculately in his dark suit; his accumulated wisdom and steadiness embedded into his features.</p> <p>Despite sitting adjacent to a successful, intimidating businessman like Fu Qingquan who had the market as his oyster for years, Fu Huai’an’s powerful presence didn’t lose out one bit. In fact, it even seemed to speak for itself with assurance.</p> <p>Grandmother Fu had been thinking about letting Fu Huai’an take over the Fu’s business, yet the problem was that Fu Qingquan and herself had adopted a son in their despair after Fu Wan left the Fu family and cut off all ties with them. They were prepared to let Fu Cheng be the heir of the Fu Family business.</p> <p>Surprisingly, Fu Cheng fell unconscious after the car accident and the Kai De Cooperation stocks plummeted. After multiple bouts of pleading from Fu Qingquan and his wife, Fu Huai’an stepped up and managed the Kai De Cooperation from its crisis all the way to that day…</p> <p>Fu Cheng had already woken up three months ago and heard the news that Kai De Cooperation had become Fu Huai’an’s oyster in the years that he was unconscious. His lower body was paralyzed and he could only use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. After thinking it through, he took the initiative to seek out Fu Qingquan and his wife to discuss the matter, saying that the Fu family should get an heir with their own blood. Afterward, he took his wife and kids abroad.</p> <p>The bastard that Lu Jinnan mentioned was an accident that Fu Qingquan made in his later years after he got ridiculously drunk and loose one evening.</p> <p>Fu Qingquan had only heard that the child existed three years ago. By then, the latter was already fourteen years old.</p> <p>The child’s sudden appearance was a great solace for Fu Qingquan, who had lost his only daughter and was fixated on having a son.</p> <p>Considering his wife’s sentiments, Fu Qingquan didn’t dare to fetch his child back. Yet after three years of bonding, the relationship between Fu Qingquan and the child was no longer ordinary.</p> <p>Fu Qingquan was devoted to nurturing his son to become the heir of the Fu’s. Yet he was concerned about being met with opposition from his shrewd wife. Thus, he operated discreetly to suppress Fu Huai’an in order to get his own son prepared to take over as heir.</p> <p>“Did it not occur to that old lad that if it wasn’t for you all these years, Kai De Cooperation would have collapsed a long time ago without being able to meet its tremendous success today? Killing off someone after you’re done using them is one thing… but not playing by the rules is another. Kai De cooperation is so huge yet he’s not scared that he’ll end up choking his precious baby to death?!”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan’s raspy voice contained an unsupressable anger.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an kept silent. He fixed his deep, distant gaze on the blurry night view outside…</p> <p>“If you were an outsider I wouldn’t say anything, but you’re the old lad’s real grandson, how could he do something like that?” Lu Jinnan irritatedly threw his cigar on the floor and stomped on it.</p> <p>Xiao Lu had already got in the car. Fu Huai’an’s eyes were half closed. As he bit on the cigarette he asked, “How many more years did you want to stay inside?”</p>",
  "Chapter 66: Don’t Blame Me for Not Warning You": "<p>Lu Jinnan kept silent on the other end of the line.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an hung up the phone.</p> <p>The car slowly started its engine.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an put out the cigar in his hands, rolled up the windows, and closed his eyes to take a brief rest.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Nuan had ended her live broadcast for the morning news. As she was removing her makeup in the makeup room, Miss Summer’s assistant Yang Yuze came to inform Lin Nuan to stay a while longer… there was a lunch meeting at noon and the chief director had especially called for Miss Summer to attend it together with Lin Nuan.</p> <p>“Not sure if it was the sponsor or the chief director who named you. Miss Summer just told me to remind you to be prepared for the lunch meeting this afternoon.”</p> <p>( Boxno vel. co m )  Lin Nuan held the cotton soaked with makeup remover in her hand and smiled at Yang Yuze. “Help me thank Miss Summer!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan had been inwardly prepared for that situation, yet with it actually happening she couldn’t help feeling a bit of panic.</p> <p>If the sponsor was the one who wanted Lin Nuan to attend, the meaning behind it was self-explanatory.</p> <p>If it was the chief director who named her to attend the meeting, then he must be trying to do justice to his niece. If so… the sponsor she had to face that afternoon would be a problem.</p> <p>No matter what, it was already quite rare for Miss Summer to let somebody come and remind her in advance.</p> <p>Lin Nuan wasn’t completely unable to get out of a situation like that. She was allergic to sweet potatoes—she even had a bag of sweet potato powder in her purse. As long as she could control the dosage it would be understandable if she couldn’t attend the meeting when she started showing allergic symptoms.</p> <p>But Lin Nuan was clear inside that she couldn’t use the tactic very often, because, in the scenario that she genuinely did need it, it would essentially be useless.</p> <p>Luckily, today’s meeting was at noon and not in the evening.</p> <p>Lin Nuan removed her makeup and dozed off in the makeup room.</p> <p>By the time Miss Summer came to call for Lin Nuan, she noticed that she was wearing a most ordinary pale pink V-collar shirt as well as black long pants with white shoes. She didn’t have any makeup on and had tied her hair into a neat ponytail. She didn’t intentionally make herself look glamorous and attractive just because she was attending the sponsored lunch meeting.</p> <p>Miss Summer grew more and more fond of Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was indeed smart… and grounded—she didn’t consider taking shortcuts.</p> <p>“I’ve heard that the new sponsor this time came from overseas. He’s relatively young and since he advanced his career abroad we have no idea what his personality is like. Later, be more open-minded during the meeting. I know you’re smart, but it wouldn’t be wise for you to offend the sponsor by playing smart…”</p> <p>Miss Summer said to her as Lin Nuan followed her into the elevator.</p> <p>The “smart” that Miss Summer mentioned may have been a reference to her slapping Gu Weiwei yesterday.</p> <p>MIss Summer pressed the elevator and continued, “This is your first time accompanying a sponsor in a meal. Be sure of your alcohol tolerance and don’t be a hero. Otherwise, don’t blame me when the management sees you as an official escort…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan nodded. “I understand, Miss Summer. Thank you.”</p> <p>She was able to discern the good from bad in people. Although Miss Summer looked cold and spoke with a sharp tone, Lin Nuan could still tell that she meant well.</p> <p>She clutched her square purse and decided to say that she was allergic to alcohol.</p> <p>Lin Nuan knew that despite that, the leaders and sponsors on their high horses would still persuade her to drink. Men would be men. She hadn’t heard of such situations.</p> <p>Miss Summer was right. It was Lin Nuan’s first time accompanying sponsors for a meetup meal. If she pulled off the alcohol intolerance card she could at least avoid some of these meetups in the future.</p> <p>With a plan in her heart, Lin Nuan felt much more at ease.</p> <p>The chief director booked the lunch at the Manjiang tower.</p> <p>Manjiang tower had a hundred years’ worth of history in Ocean City and was both an icon and symbol of the city’s architecture. It was located at the Qujiang business zone near the sea.</p>",
  "Chapter 67: That Sounds Too Intimate": "<p>The moment Miss Xia parked her car and walked in with Lin Nuan, a waitress donning a cheongsam brought them through the long corridor filled with carvings and paintings to the Huxin Gazebo that stood in the center of the pond. A Linxiao Pavilion plaque hung at the front.</p> <p>From the table, it was evident that not all dishes had been served. Eight or nine people were casually lounging there but the sponsors and the vice president of the broadcasting company had yet to arrive. Once they saw Miss Xia walking over, they all stood up to greet her.</p> <p>What surprised Lin Nuan was seeing Bai Xiaonian at the table.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian saw her and informed the person beside her before she picked up her bag and stood up, walking towards her and Miss Xia.</p> <p>After greeting Miss Xia with a nod of her head, Bai Xiaonian grabbed Lin Nuan’s arm and said, “Accompany me to the bathroom!”</p> <p>Dragging Lin Nuan to a corner, Bai Xiaonian spoke up with furrowed brows, “I heard that this time the sponsor asked specifically for you to come. This doesn’t seem appropriate…”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian took out a piece of yam shortcake from her bag and passed it to Lin Nuan, saying, “Eat a bite or two now… When it’s almost time to drink later it should start working up. When that happens, regardless of whether or not that sponsor tries to get you drunk, you just drink a few sips and I’ll take you away! As long as the higher-ups believe that you’re allergic to alcohol, you can completely avoid coming to these kinds of meet-ups in the future.”</p> <p>Knowing that Bai Xiaonian came for her, Lin Nuan’s heart felt warm.</p> <p>Lin Nuan took the yam shortcake and took a bite, chewing slightly before swallowing.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian returned to the table, the vice president and the sponsor had arrived.</p> <p>Once he saw Lin Nuan return, the large-sized vice president immediately stood up and gestured for Lin Nuan to go over.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, come here and give President Tang a toast. Your morning news department’s greatest sponsor is President Tang. You can say that without him there would be no morning news department!”</p> <p>A man in a suit sat beside the vice president. Holding an unlit cigarette between his fingers, he looked towards Lin Nuan.</p> <p>The noon sunlight was piercingly bright and reflected off the surface of the pond water to outline his strong facial features. The light seemed to go through his flawlessly fair and porcelain skin, looking tight and poreless. His long narrow eyes were black and tilted up at the end, looking as though he was smiling. He had a sharp nose and thin lips that were pursed tightly but curved up at a corner, giving him an unrestrained vibe.</p> <p>Next to President Tang was an empty seat; anyone could tell that it was meant to be Lin Nuan’s seat.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian squeezed Lin Nuan’s hand and smiled at the vice president and President Tang before finding an empty seat to sit on.</p> <p>Lin Nuan knew what she had to do and did not flinch; she walked towards the vice president.</p> <p>It was Tang Zheng’s first time seeing Lin Nuan. Different from when she was on screen, when Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian walked towards the gazebo, that delicately crafted face shone from the light. In his daze it felt like she was an angel, making Tang Zheng’s heart skip a beat.</p> <p>He mused internally that no wonder Old Fu liked her.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan…” The vice president passed Lin Nuan a cup of wine and hurriedly pushed her towards Tang Zheng. “President Tang said that he provided such a huge sponsorship this time because of you.”</p> <p>That sounded too intimate and Lin Nuan tightened her grip on the cup.</p> <p>“President Tang, a toast to you.” Lin Nuan’s voice remained neutral while her eyes showed her stubborn resistance.</p> <p>The spicy strong alcohol entered her mouth and trickled down her gullet; her forehead faintly started perspiring.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was not like other people who gave friendly smiles the moment they saw the sponsor’s handsome and elegant figure.</p> <p>In Lin Nuan’s eyes, no matter how well-dressed Mr. Tang was, he was still a fake gentleman who forced others to accompany him to meals and drinks… And even to bed.</p>",
  "Chapter 68: Directly Calling On Lin Nuan": "<p>The sponsor was targetting the female anchor, and the meaning behind that went without saying.</p> <p>Before Tang Zheng could say anything, he saw Lin Nuan drink up a cup of strong alcohol and his smile was akin to that of a scheming fox; he picked up his cup, cigarette in hand, and drank up its contents at once.</p> <p>The vice president thought he understood the meaning behind the smile in Tang Zheng’s eyes and so he added more alcohol into Lin Nuan’s cup, saying, “Little Lin is forthright indeed. Come come come… Have another cup! You have to thank President Tang properly!”</p> <p>“According to your words, Mr. Vice President, the one who should toast President Tang the most seems to be me…”</p> <p>A friendly voice cut into the conversation.</p> <p>Miss Xia couldn’t stand the way the vice president was forcefully pushing Lin Nuan out to butter up Tang Zheng so she walked over with her cup and draped her slender arm around Lin Nuan’s shoulder, nonchalantly pulling her back in a defensive manner without anyone noticing.</p> <p>“President Tang, this is my toast to you…” Miss Xia gave a slight smile to Tang Zheng as she spoke.</p> <p>Seeing Miss Xia go over, the others looked delighted and were tempted to make their moves as they filled up their own cups with liquor, ready to make friends with the handsome and rich sponsor.</p> <p>Miss Xia’s move to protect her was silently noted down by Lin Nuan, whose face had already started itching.</p> <p>Tang Zheng raised his gaze, his long eyes half-lidded. He looked at Lin Nuan who was standing behind Miss Xia, a smile on his lips as he ignored the latter’s words.</p> <p>He brought the unlit cigarette to his lips and the sound of the lighter rang throughout the gazebo. Soon, faint white smoke passed from his lips as he said, “Miss Lin’s social connections seem pretty good. It seems that if I want to drink with Miss Lin, I’ll have to go past all those sitting at this table first?”</p> <p>Tang Zheng’s voice carried his smile as he directly called out Lin Nuan in a half-joking, half-serious manner.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian’s eyebrows drew tightly together as she worried for Lin Nuan. Even Miss Xia couldn’t protect Lin Nuan anymore? She considered contacting Fu Huai’an. After all, Fu Huai’an was going to marry Lin Nuan—he shouldn’t be able to watch Lin Nuan get lusted over by other men.</p> <p>The vice president was extremely experienced in handling social connections. He knew something was wrong the moment those words were spoken and that the sponsor was unhappy, so he gave a warning glare to Miss Xia while he smiled and said, “That’s right, Little Lin is a nice person so she gets along well with her other colleagues. But President Tang, you’re so charming, it’s rare for our Miss Xia to make a toast to someone, this is for you! Little Lin… Why aren’t you sitting next to President Tang? Go drink a few rounds!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan placed down her cup—filled to the brim with liquor by the vice president just then—with some force, causing the alcohol to spill over her slender fingers. The cup was suddenly only half-filled.</p> <p>Perhaps Lin Nuan was true as Fu Huai’an had said—she was intelligent, but she was horrible at socializing and handling relations with others.</p> <p>She wasn’t someone who was sociable towards everyone. When she was in the Lin family, she was their young lady so she had the right to remain proud in front of everyone else. The pride that was carved into her bones by Liang Mulan was in her nature; Lin Nuan couldn’t change it.</p> <p>Just like how it was currently—even though she had already thought up countless plans of retreat, she still wasn’t giving them face when dealing with the coercive vice president and sponsor.</p> <p>“President Tang, Lin Nuan is allergic to alcohol and she only drank a cup because Vice President said that you provided a large sponsorship to the morning news department. As they all say, female anchors rely on their looks the most to remain fed. If she drinks another cup, Lin Nuan’s face may be ruined and that’s not even the most important thing—I’m afraid that even her life will be placed on the line.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian stood up in a rush and spoke.</p>",
  "Chapter 69: The Show Would Be Crashed!": "<p>Once Bai Xiaonian finished speaking, Tang Zheng looked towards Lin Nuan. Just one cup of alcohol down, and Lin Nuan’s face and neck was already flushed with an unnatural shade of red.</p> <p>Tang Zheng’s heart stuttered. He had planned to corner Lin Nuan and make her slightly drunk so that Fu Huai’an could come to rescue his damsel in distress and leave her with a better impression of himself. But if Lin Nuan was truly allergic to alcohol, the show would be crashed!</p> <p>All it took was another short second for the small red rashes to appear on both sides of Lin Nuan’s face.</p> <p>“Being allergic to alcohol isn’t a minor matter!” Tang Zheng stood up and picked up his box of cigarettes, lighter and car keys from the table. “I’ll send you to the hospital!”</p> <p>“President Tang!” Bai Xiaonian was one step ahead of him and was already beside Lin Nuan, holding her up as she said, “You’ve been drinking so it will be inconvenient for you to drive. My car is parked downstairs, so sorry, I’ll be making my leave with Lin Nuan.”</p> <p>Tang Zheng watched as Bai Xiaonian hurriedly brought Lin Nuan away, her bag already in hand. Tang Zheng refused to believe—even over his dead body—that Bai Xiaonian had thought of the escape at the last minute.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Once Lin Nuan got into the car, Bai Xiaonian took out the allergy pills and opened a bottle of mineral water for Lin Nuan.</p> <p>“I’ve already asked before, and this medicine will not react with alcohol…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face was itching uncomfortably. She took the pills and mineral water Bai Xiaonian passed over and raised her head to swallow the pills, finding the very act difficult.</p> <p>Only when she was properly seated in Bai Xiaonian’s car did Lin Nuan heave a sigh of relief, her body and mind exhausted as though she had just gone through a battle.</p> <p>She could still feel the burn on her face and her bag was endlessly vibrating.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian thought that it was definitely the vice president calling to lecture them and she found the ringing annoying, saying, “Can’t he just properly sponsor you? It’s not like you’re all taking the sponsor for granted. Why should the money used up in advertising be taken back because he couldn’t feel up the female anchor? How shameless are they?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan lowered her head and took out her phone from her bag. Seeing that it was Miss Xia calling, she picked up the call saying, “Miss Xia…”</p> <p>“Is your face alright? If you can’t get on tomorrow’s broadcast, I’ll find a replacement.” Miss Xia’s voice remained calm..</p> <p>Lin Nuan pulled down the mirror and took a look at her reflection. Based on past experience, she said, “I can make it tomorrow, it won’t affect the live show.”</p> <p>“That’s good.”</p> <p>Just as Miss Xia was about to hang up, Lin Nuan said, “Miss Xia, thank you for today…”</p> <p>On the other side of the line, Miss Xia remained silent for a moment before replying, “Hurry to the hospital.”</p> <p>The car ride from Jiangman Garden to Lin Nuan’s house took around half an hour, and because she took the medicine in time, once the medicine took effect Lin Nuan’s face quickly felt relief and the red dots on it gradually faded. Unless someone paid close attention, the marks were unnoticeable.</p> <p>Unlocking her door and entering the house, Lin Nuan asked, “What do you want to eat?”</p> <p>When they were drinking, both Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian didn’t even get to touch their chopsticks and they were both very hungry.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian didn’t reply. The whole journey when she was sending Lin Nuan home, Bai Xiaonian didn’t speak at all, until Lin Nuan asked her that question, and she then said, “I’m considering changing my job…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hands paused in the middle of placing her bag onto the shoe cabinet and she turned back to look at Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian gave a relaxed smile and shut the door, saying, “Haven’t I always been writing for E.N magazine’s delicacies column? Their main editor keeps inviting me to join them so I plan to go over.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian was the same as Lin Nuan—both couldn’t accept the unspoken rules in the industry.</p> <p>The narrow space at the entryway was filled with silence.</p> <p>“Stubbornly staying in this job for so long, I’ve seen everyone fight with their lives for a chance to show their faces on the screen, giving gifts… or even gifting their bodies. I find it boring.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian looked towards the floor-to-ceiling window as she spoke, avoiding looking into Lin Nuan’s eyes.</p>",
  "Chapter 70: Isn’t It Rather Interesting": "<p>Coming straight out of the university, three ladies had walked together as companions. One went on to the bright path of stardom and became a popular female celebrity, one was prepared to be the editor of a food column for a magazine—only Lin Nuan was taking a small step on the path to being an anchor.</p> <p>And once, amongst the trio, Bai Xiaonian’s dream to be a news anchor was the strongest and most determined.</p> <p>Because her mother was once the best news anchor on national television, she had won countless news awards on an international level.</p> <p>Ever since Bai Xiaonian’s mother passed away, becoming an anchor for the national television’s late-night news had become the goal Bai Xiaonian had chased after.</p> <p>Lin Nuan picked up the keys she had just placed down on the shoe cabinet and said to Bai Xiaonian, “Let’s go out to eat.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Once Lin Nuan left, facing Haicheng TV Station’s vice president’s flattery, Tang Zheng felt bored.</p> <p>Halfway through the meal, Tang Zheng pretended to receive a call and left saying he had urgent business.</p> <p>Once he was in the car, Tang Zheng called Fu Huai’an as he lit up a cigarette. Once he heard the call get picked up, he threw the lighter onto the passenger seat beside him and started up the car, asking, “Where are you, Old Fu? If you haven’t eaten lunch yet let’s go have a meal together?”</p> <p>Tang Zheng knew that Fu Huai’an was an workaholic so he likely hadn’t eaten at that time, and so he called over to ask, and of course, that was the answer he got.</p> <p>Hanging up, Tang Zheng drove to the building of the Kai De Group to fetch Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>By the time Tang Zheng arrived, Fu Huai’an was still in the middle of settling work.</p> <p>He leaned on the big office desk with a cigarette in his mouth, signing documents while instructing his assistant Little Lu, “Hong Yuan’s branch company wants to meet in Shanghai next week, you give Vice President Dong a call and tell him to knock some sense into Hong Yuan’s manager. Tell him to lie low these next few days…”</p> <p>“Alright!” Little Lu nodded his head and put away the documents before nodding at Tang Zheng and leaving.</p> <p>Tang Zheng watched as Fu Huai’an let out a puff of white smoke and extinguished the cigarette while he sat down on the couch, asking, “Can we go already?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an nodded, walking around his desk to pick up the suit jacket laying over the back of the sofa chair as well as the box of cigarettes and lighter on the desk. He casually took out yet another cigarette, asking, “What do you want to eat?”</p> <p>Tang Zheng originally wanted to convince Fu Huai’an to smoke less, but he himself had a cigarette between his fingers so his words changed as they reached his mouth.</p> <p>“Your addiction to smoking is growing.””</p> <p>Fu Huai’an put on his jacket and he remained silent as white smoke rose from the corner of his lips..</p> <p>…</p> <p>After Tang Zheng returned to his home country, he had been missing the taste of the Sichuan cuisine in the country. Haicheng’s best Sichuan cuisine chef worked in Shu Garden, so Fu Huai’an chose to eat at Shu Garden.</p> <p>Once the duo parked the car and got off, Tang Zheng saw Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian sitting by the window.</p> <p>“Didn’t she go to the hospital from an alcohol allergy?”</p> <p>Tang Zheng saw a few empty bottles of beer on Lin Nuan’s and Bai Xiaonian’s table, and he couldn’t bring himself to believe that the light amber liquid in the glass in front of Lin Nuan was tea.</p> <p>Finally processing it, Tang Zheng was truly impressed by Lin Nuan—she used the self-harming action to escape…</p> <p>Seeing Fu Huai’an look over at him, Tang Zheng explained, “At noon I met up with the vice president of the Haicheng TV Station for a meal and asked specifically for Lin Nuan to come. I planned to pick on her and then when it was about time I’d call you over so you can rescue your damsel in distress. I didn’t think that Lin Nuan would leave after one cup of liquor with the excuse of being allergic to alcohol. I was even prepared to apologize to you for this matter later during our meal, I didn’t expect that once I turned around she would be drinking with the person meant to drive her to the hospital… Don’t you think this is all rather interesting?”</p>",
  "Chapter 71: You Should Be Familiar Acquaintances With Miss Lin": "<p>One glass window apart, Lin Nuan became aware of two pairs of eyes focusing on them and she turned around… and paused.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was standing not far away with the very same President Tang she met at noon, and they were both looking their way.</p> <p>Especially that President Tang… He looked at Lin Nuan with a gaze full of teasing smiles and amusement.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hand tightened around her chopsticks and she quickly turned back, pretending she didn’t see anything while her heart thundered.</p> <p>Why is that sponsor together with Fu Huai’an?</p> <p>Seeing the glass of beer by her left hand, Lin Nuan had some hope left in her heart that the sponsor hadn’t seen it.</p> <p>The other stuff was fine, but if the sponsor told the station about the matter and they found out that Lin Nuan wasn’t allergic to alcohol and had merely used it as an excuse to escape, she could imagine that in the future, for similar scenes like the one at noon, Lin Nuan would have no excuse to run away.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan’s tense body as though she was about to fight a huge enemy, Bai Xiaonian also looked out the window but didn’t see anything.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head. Hopefully what happened just now was her imagination and that President Tang did not actually see her and Bai Xiaonian sitting here.</p> <p>Hey, what a coincidence meeting you here…”</p> <p>Tang Zheng’s smiling voice caused Lin Nuan’s back to stiffen.</p> <p>While speaking, Tang Zheng had already stood beside their table with a smile. The way he looked down, his gaze towards Lin Nuan seemed to have a hidden meaning.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian probably didn’t guess that they would meet “President Tang” there either, her big eyes flashing with panic as she looked up at Tang Zheng… The alcohol was stuck in her throat, and she didn’t know whether it was appropriate to either swallow or do nothing.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian glanced at the half empty glass of beer in front of Lin Nuan. How unlucky, meeting the sponsor right when they just came out for a meal…</p> <p>Plus, it was just when they were in the middle of drinking that they bumped into the sponsor who thought that Lin Nuan was allergic to alcohol.</p> <p>Sensing a broad shadow loom over her from behind her back, Lin Nuan knew that Fu Huai’an was behind her and she tightened her hold on her chopsticks, her breathing becoming unnatural.</p> <p>Last night, kissing Fu Huai’an had a different feeling to it compared to the first time she made love with him. The first time, Lin Nuan had faced that intimacy with the intention of giving over her body.</p> <p>But last night, Lin Nuan could clearly feel herself getting stirred up and her desire was more honest.</p> <p>From last night until today, she had purposefully avoided thinking about being intimate with Fu Huai’an as she didn’t want to remember that shameful stutter she felt in her heart. But all that work went down the drain the moment she saw him.</p> <p>She felt that her eyelids were so heavy she could barely lift them—Fu Huai’an’s taste in her mouth was still unbelievably clear.</p> <p>With Fu Huai’an behind her, Lin Nuan felt as though a bright piercing light was shining on her back and she was unable to act natural and relaxed.</p> <p>Without waiting for Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian to invite them, Tang Zheng waved to the waiter and said, “Add two more sets of utensils to this table.”</p> <p>After speaking, Tang Zheng smiled and asked Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian, “Today Miss Lin seemed to be allergic to alcohol after making a toast to me. I’ve been feeling so guilty I couldn’t eat so I couldn’t even finish my meal. Since we’ve coincidentally met here, it must be fate. Can we sit together to eat?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian remained silent, a series of ellipses going through her mind.</p> <p>How could they say no when Tang Zheng had already gotten the waiter to add utensils?</p> <p>Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian sat next to the window while their bags were left on the chair near the corridor.</p> <p>“Move your bag.”</p> <p>Tang Zheng picked up Bai Xiaonian’s clutch and passed it to her. Bai Xiaonian could only take it since she couldn’t offend the sponsor.</p> <p>Tang Zheng naturally sit beside Bai Xiaonian, his skill at acting overly familiar was amazing.</p> <p>“Old Fu, come sit! You should be familiar acquaintances with Miss Lin…”</p>",
  "Chapter 72: Old Fu’s Childhood Friend": "<p>Tang Zheng called Fu Huai’an over as though he was the owner, the words ‘familiar acquaintances’ sounding as though it had another meaning behind them.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s ears flushed red and she could only place her chopsticks down to move her bag away. Her face had on an awkward expression as she contemplated how to explain the matter of her alcohol allergy to Tang Zheng so that he wouldn’t bring the matter up with the station.</p> <p>The sound of Fu Huai’an pulling out the chair rang out beside her ear, and Lin Nuan placed her bag on her lap, grabbing it tightly.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an removed his jacket and placed it on the back of the chair before sitting next to Lin Nuan relaxedly. Crossing his legs and leaning back in a casual manner, his mature vibe was apparent.</p> <p>Tang Zheng’s gaze swept over the half-empty glass of beer that Lin Nuan had already drunk from and said, “I’m at fault for what happened today. I didn’t know that Miss Lin is allergic to the alcohol in white liquor, but isn’t allergic to the alcohol in beer. We should’ve had beer at lunch instead.”</p> <p>Tang Zheng’s words were extremely sharp—how could the alcohol in white liquor be any different from that in beer?</p> <p>The half-empty beer glass was right in front of Lin Nuan, and she didn’t have thick enough skin to refuse to admit the truth.</p> <p>“President Tang, I wasn’t actually allergic to alcohol earlier. I simply thought of this move to avoid being brought to these kinds of entertainment sessions in the future, so I hope that President Tang will not bring this matter up with the station.” Lin Nuan spoke clearly and honestly.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian didn’t say anything because she felt that any explanation would be superfluous, and since President Tang was there with Fu Huai’an, he wouldn’t pick on Lin Nuan for Fu Huai’an’s sake.</p> <p>Lin Nuan confessed to Tang Zheng with red ears yet still spoke in a self-righteous tone.</p> <p>Tang Zheng glanced at Fu Huai’an who was sitting beside Lin Nuan and said with a slight smile, “Understandable, understandable! I totally understand! I’m not the gossipy kind either. Since Miss Lin can drink, then we shall drink all we want here. Old Fu is here too so Miss Lin should be able to believe that I have no ill intentions towards you.”</p> <p>He put Lin Nuan and Fu Huai’an together and spoke in such a teasing tone, but Lin Nuan could only feel guilty at the mention of Fu Huai’an so she was left feeling extremely embarrassed.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an lit up a cigarette and placed the lighter and cigarette box at the corner of the table, his deep and thick voice ringing as he asked, “What are you allergic to?”</p> <p>The question was directed at Lin Nuan.</p> <p>The faint cigarette smoke smell lingered in the air, making Lin Nuan tense and straighten up as she replied, “Yams…”</p> <p>Tang Zheng ordered a few more dishes and told the waiter Fu Huai’an’s name, saying to let the main chef make these few dishes himself, and then ordered the waiter to bring over a box of beer.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an rested his hand holding the cigarette onto his knee and watched as the waiter carried the beer over. Lightly tapping the cigarette to get rid of the cigarette ash, he said, “A glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.”</p> <p>Tang Zheng bit onto a cigarette as he poured a cup of beer for Bai Xiaonian before filling up Lin Nuan’s glass. He then filled up his and Fu Huai’an’s glasses and said, “What orange juice, we’re all drinking… How boring is it for you to be drinking orange juice by yourself?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an remained silent as he smoked while Tang Zheng raised his glass at Lin Nuan in a forthright manner, saying, “Let me introduce myself: I’m called Tang Zheng and I’m Old Fu’s childhood friend and employee. My company’s behind-the-scenes big boss is Old Fu…”</p> <p>As Tang Zheng was making his self-introduction, he was showing off Fu Huai’an’s wealth towards Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was just about to pick up the glass of beer in front of her when the waiter served the orange juice, placing the glass in front of Fu Huai’an respectfully.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an held onto the cigarette in his mouth as he took away the beer in front of Lin Nuan with one hand and replaced it with the orange juice with the other. His dark-colored, form-fitting shirt tightened from his actions and outlined his perfectly proportioned back and torso.</p>",
  "Chapter 73: Won’t Trouble a Lady": "<p>Amidst the misty smoke, Fu Huai’an’s eyes were half closed. His movements were calm and unhurried, every action radiating a vibe of nonchalance.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was startled by Fu Huai’an’s sudden move. The fresh scent of cigars on his body struck her senses and she instinctively dodged and retreated back. She then immediately realized how childish her reaction just looked and adjusted her posture awkwardly.</p> <p>At eye level, she could spot Fu Huai’an’s Adam’s apple from his open collar shirt gently gliding up and down. Lin Nuan’s face burned like fire as she looked down and heard Tang Zheng poking fun at her.</p> <p>“Hey hey hey… Brother Fu, that’s not the way you protect someone. How could you let Miss Lin drink juice when I’m offering drinks?” Tang Zheng complained as he pretended to be unhappy about it.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian knew Tang Zheng and Fu Huai’an’s special bond, yet she didn’t like the sight of someone trying to make Lin Nuan drink more.</p> <p>Lin Nuan usually didn’t drink. She only accompanied Bai Xiaonian to have a drink today to relieve her of the agony in her heart.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian remembered that she had already decided to switch industries and was suddenly not intimidated by Tang Zheng anymore. She raised her glass to Fu Huai’an and said, “Mr. Fu, let me give you a toast. You’re a true man and wouldn’t trouble a lady.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian’s comment was an obvious attack towards Tang Zheng. He then turned his head to look at Bai Xiaonian seriously.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an hadn’t raised anything yet. His cigar-wielding hand lifted up the cup he’d just swapped with Lin Nuan. He raised his glass to acknowledge the toast and took a sip, his movements reflecting a calm and collected appearance.</p> <p>Sensing Fu Huai’an was holding her own glass of beer, the scene of her lips pressed up against Fu Huai’an’s suddenly popped up in her head. Lin Nuan felt incredibly uneasy.</p> <p>She pretended to act calm as she raised her glass to take a sip of the orange juice. Her movements were so stiff as if she was worried that people wouldn’t be able to see how nervous she actually was. Tang Zheng smirked and fell into a great mood. He forgot what Bai Xiaonian had said to him.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s gaze fell outside the transparent car window. She saw a young couple wearing the Ocean City’s third high-school uniform kissing and hugging as they pleased under the bus stop sign. Her face burned even more and she immediately looked elsewhere.</p> <p>The scene of their kiss last night suddenly appeared in her head. Fu Huai’an was sitting right next to her at that moment. Lin Nuan wasn’t the unabashed type of girl and couldn’t manage to stay unbothered.</p> <p>After admiring Lin Nuan’s expression, Tang Zheng turned around and interrogated Bai Xiaonian, “Miss Bai, so according to your words… I’m just a hypocrite?”</p> <p>“Then Chief Tang is admitting that he’s troubling a lady?” Bai Xiaonian smiled at Tang Zheng.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian felt like she had nothing to back herself up. If it wasn’t for Fu Huai’an collecting the certificate with Lin Nuan, and if it wasn’t for the fact that she was already planning on leaving the Ocean City radio station, she probably wouldn’t have the courage to say all that.</p> <p>Seeing Tang Zheng lift his eyebrows, Bai Xiaonian added sheepishly, “But for such an elegant man like Chief Tang, you wouldn’t trouble a lady right…?”</p> <p>“Miss Bai on her high horse truly is intimidating!” Tang Zheng grinned like a sly fox. “If I demand a drink from you, wouldn’t that make me an unpolished hypocrite who likes to trouble ladies?”</p> <p>Tang Zheng was a notorious nitpicker in their circle—he wouldn’t let himself suffer any losses. What he said left Bai Xiaonian at a complete loss for words.</p> <p>That made Bai Xiaonian feel like she’d just shot herself in the foot.</p> <p>Without waiting for Bai Xiaonian to disagree, Lin Nuan was already replying with irritation, “Chief Tang—”</p> <p>“Just focus on eating your meal.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an almost spoke at the same time as Lin Nuan did. His voice was calm and cool yet magnetic at the same time.</p>",
  "Chapter 74: A Streak of Vanity Surfaces": "<p>Lin Nuan remaining words got choked in her throat. She actually wanted to say Tang Zheng’s speech was clearly intended to make her look bad.</p> <p>She had intended to enjoy a nice meal with Bai Xiaonian here, yet he came without an invitation and forced himself in. It was indeed a difficult situation.</p> <p>“You’re the big boss, you call the shots.”</p> <p>Tang Zheng looked like he couldn’t care less. He was well aware that Fu Huai’an didn’t plan on something like a “post-alcohol hookup” with Lin Nuan. Thus, he put down the glass in his hands and looked at Lin Nuan with an ambivalent grin, guessing what distasteful thing he was going to say to her just then.</p> <p>Throughout the whole meal, Fu Huai’an kept getting calls and Lin Nuan was eating distractedly.</p> <p>Lin Nuan usually kept a light diet. She only chose Shu Garden in consideration of Bai Xiaonian’s preference today and she was initially planning on persuading her friend. But before she could begin, Fu Huai’an and Tang Zheng had invited themselves to the party.</p> <p>Halfway through the meal, the weather outside grew dark and it began to rain.</p> <p>The raindrops pattered against the transparent glass windows. Lin Nuan turned her head to look out the window as she guessed how long the rain would continue. But through the glass, she saw Fu Huai’an standing on the stairs to Shu Garden.</p> <p>He was wearing a shirt and a fitting vest, with one hand holding his phone and the other flicking his cigar above the trash bin. His figure was tall and slender, the intricate opal buttons on his neat, fixed sleeves glistening under the lights.</p> <p>For a man with such fashion taste and elegance, standing there alone was a piece of scenery in itself. He naturally received many glances from passing strangers; his every movement radiated a noble yet grounded and mature quality. It gave an impression of superiority and made people afraid of approaching him up close. They only dared to admire him from afar.</p> <p>He stood under the lights which accentuated his prominent features and his cold-looking profile. His eyes hid a mark of long accumulated yet suppressed anger.</p> <p>Lin Nuan watched him bring the cigar to his lips as he gently bit on it. His large hands unbuttoned his shirt collar as his lips opened and released the swirling smoke.</p> <p>She had to admit that men like Fu Huai’an were very attractive to women, including her.</p> <p>A mature man without many words who radiated an alpha presence appeared much more charming and attractive than the popular fresh meat of the age.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had to admit, to hear that she was liked by a man like that undoubtedly made her feel a streak of vanity as a woman.</p> <p>It could have been telepathy—Fu Huai’an suddenly moved his gaze and looked towards Lin Nuan, his deep eyes appearing unfathomable and inscrutable.</p> <p>As their gazes held, Lin Nuan felt embarrassed to be caught looking at him and immediately turned around. Her elbow, however, knocked down the orange juice on the table and the cup fell towards Fu Huai’an’s seat, the drink spilling over the whole chair. Luckily, Fu Huai’an wasn’t sitting there at the moment.</p> <p>“Wow… what were you even looking at that made you so distracted you knocked over your juice?” Tang Zheng mocked Lin Nuan with a smug tone.</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked down and whipped out a tissue to wipe the chair. Her heartbeat accelerated and she felt incredibly sheepish.</p> <p>Outside the room, Fu Huai’an watched Lin Nuan ruefully get up to wipe the table. He smiled and the anger dissipated from his eyes significantly. Even his tone softened as he replied, “There are many examples of voluntary murder cases being judged as not guilty, but you shouldn’t attempt it if you’ve never done it before. Pass this case on to Lawyer Gu. I hope there won’t be a second time.”</p> <p>As he hung up the phone, Fu Huai’an strode back to find his chair already tidied up as if nothing had happened.</p> <p>Lin Nuan couldn’t bring herself to say sorry out loud and her ears were burning red. “I got your seat wet by accident just now…”</p> <p>“I know.” Fu Huai’an’s voice sounded raspy from his recent cigar.</p>",
  "Chapter 75: Which Hospital?": "<p>Fu Huai’an implied that the sheepish Lin Nuan always seemed to be thinking about Fu Huai’an… Knowing that she was caught gazing at him, her ears flushed even more.</p> <p>The phone inside Lin Nuan’s backpack vibrated. As it began to ring, Tang Zheng looked in Lin Nuan’s direction and said with a smile, “Look at how fated they are. I had no idea Miss Lin had the exact same ringtone as Fu Brother’s!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan ignored Tang Zheng who harbored ill intentions. She took a glance at the caller ID and saw it was Liang Mulan. She picked it up.</p> <p>“Hello, Mother…”</p> <p>As soon as Lin Nuan answered, she heard Lin Ran’s desperate crying on the other end: “Lin Nuan… Mother fell from the elevator and she’s covered in blood. Father’s phone is turned off and Brother isn’t answering… I’m all by myself at the hospital, what should I do?! What should I do?!”</p> <p>Lin Ran didn’t know why she called Lin Nuan. In the hospital, she was the only one present. Liang Mulan was in the emergency room and the butler went to take care of her registration. And so she began to panic. Lin Chen wasn’t picking up and Father’s phone was turned off because he was on a plane. Lin Ran had no idea who to contact. With Liang Mulan’s phone in her hands, she decided to call Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan immediately stood up, dropping her chopsticks on the plate. Her heart seemed to dangle in mid-air as she grabbed her purse, ready to leave at any minute. “Which hospital is it?”</p> <p>Her wrist was grabbed by Fu Huai’an. He stood up and took his suit jacket on the seat and asked, “Which hospital is it?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s heart was beating incredibly fast. Her head was filled with frightening images of Liang Mulan covered all over in blood and her heart was caught in her throat. She couldn’t even articulate a single word. She was just terrified.</p> <p>She opened her mouth but nothing came out. Her little face was pale as a sheet as she struggled to say something. Fu Huai’an grasped harder at her thin wrist. “It’s difficult to catch a taxi in the rain. I’ll send you there.”</p> <p>“What happened?” Bai Xiaonian stood up and asked, seeing Lin Nuan’s awfully pale face.</p> <p>“Fu Brother…” Tang Zheng threw the car keys to Fu Huai’an with a very perceptive look.</p> <p>As he caught the car keys, Fu Huai’an pulled Lin Nuan along as he walked outside.</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan!?” Bai Xiaonian wanted to chase after her but was quickly pulled back by Tang Zheng.</p> <p>“If you really are Lin Nuan’s friend, then don’t go!” Tang Zheng said with a big grin, “No matter what happens, Fu Brother can handle it. He finally got an opportunity to be alone with his beloved so don’t meddle in it. These two people getting their certificate together… you need to give them space to nurture their relationship!”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian wanted to argue against Tang Zheng but felt he had a point.</p> <p>Watching Fu Huai’an guide Lin Nuan through the rain and into the car seat, Bai Xiaonian yanked back her wrist from Tang Zheng’s grasp and yelled to the waiter, “Bill!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The hospital.</p> <p>When Lin Nuan arrived, she spotted Lin Ran standing at the entrance of the ward department, her head bent down. She jogged over and asked, “Where’s Mother?”</p> <p>At that point, Liang Mulan’s situation was already stabilized. Her head and elbow both received stitches. Although the other results hadn’t come back yet, the doctor said it shouldn’t be a big problem and that they were all exterior injuries.</p> <p>Liang Mulan was sent inside the emergency room covered with blood, thus Lin Ran called Lin Nuan in a moment of panic. After she’d calmed down, she began to very much regret her actions.</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Ran wasn’t talking, Lin Nuan grasped her thin arm and raised her voice by a higher pitch, “Where’s Mother?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was always extra polite to Lin Ran, especially because of her real parents. She felt an extra sense of guilt towards Lin Ran and had never talked to her so loudly before.</p>",
  "Chapter 76: Miss and Son-in-Law Are Here": "<p>Lin Ran’s eyes were red. The urge to say something mean was on the tip of her tongue, but seeing the intimidating Fu Huai’an following after Lin Nuan, those words were stuck in her throat.</p> <p>“18th floor…” Lin Ran mumbled as she pursed her lips, unwilling to say another word.</p> <p>Lin Nuan let go of Lin Ran and rushed towards the elevator.</p> <p>…</p> <p>As she walked out of the elevator, Lin Nuan saw the butler carrying a thermos bottle outside one of the wards.</p> <p>“Uncle Mu!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan called out as she jogged over.</p> <p>“Miss, you came!” The Mu butler couldn’t contain his joy at seeing her.</p> <p>He noticed Fu Huai’an standing behind Lin Nuan, emanating an extraordinary presence. Butler Mu recalled that last night at the dinner table, Liang Mulan had mentioned that Lin Nuan had already gotten her marriage certificate, thus he couldn’t help paying more attention to Fu Huai’an more and nodded at him.</p> <p>Butler Mu had been in the Lin Family for many years. He had seen a lot and had come in contact with a lot of people. Fu Huai’an wasn’t old, yet his eyes had a feeling of depth to it. He wore a suit and the mature, refined presence he radiated was especially intense, just like their family’s Lin Chen. He had an air of authority and an intimidating quality unlike most peers his age.</p> <p>Butler Mu naturally compared Fu Huai’an and Lin Chen and found it very difficult to see who was the real alpha.</p> <p>“How’s my mother doing?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood at the door and asked. She didn’t know how badly Liang Mulan was injured and wanted to know more about the situation so she could prepare herself mentally for it.</p> <p>“The doctor said there’s no big issue. It’s just that the wound on her hand was pretty long and needed twenty-eight stitches. She also had three stitches in her head. The CT scan of her head hasn’t come out yet, but the doctor said she wasn’t unconscious when she fell down so there shouldn’t be a big problem.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s heart in mid-air finally came down slightly. She then realized her feet were numb.</p> <p>“Is Mother awake?”</p> <p>Butler Mu nodded and turned around to open the ward door for Lin Nuan. He walked inside first and said to Liang Mulan, “Auntie, Miss and your son-in-law are here.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt somewhat uncomfortable upon hearing the title son-in-law for the first time. She looked at Liang Mulan in panic but she didn’t explain.</p> <p>Lying in bed, Liang Mulan was calling her husband who had just landed from his flight. As she heard them, she hurriedly said, “It’s fine, I’m okay. You don’t need to fly back. Nuan Nuan is here, so I’m hanging up first…”</p> <p>Seeing that Liang Mulan didn’t look as awful as she’d imagined, Lin Nuan let out a deep sigh of relief. Her heart finally returned to her chest yet her eyes grew wet and her throat felt stifled.</p> <p>“Why did you guys come?” Liang Mulan didn’t want Lin Nuan to worry and made a little face at her. However, she accidentally pulled the wound on her face, causing it to sting a little.</p> <p>Lin Nuan put down her bag and turned around to look at Fu Huai’an. “Thank you for sending me here…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s order for him to leave was indeed quite heartless. Fu Huai’an had sent her over here and she couldn’t even wait for him take a drink of water before trying to get rid of him.</p> <p>Seeing Fu Huai’an’s deep, enigmatic eyes glancing towards her, she herself felt sheepish. Her ears turned red and betrayed her yet again.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an walked past Lin Nuan and said a few words to Liang Mulan, then left the ward accompanied by Butler Mu.</p> <p>The ward was only left with Lin Nuan and Liang Mulan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan took the thermos bottle that Butler Mu had brought over. “I’ll go get you some warm water.”</p> <p>Liang Mulan didn’t say anything. She knew Lin Nuan felt awful inside…</p> <p>Inside the water room.</p> <p>Lin Nuan put the bottle under the tap of the water tank and began to collect the water. Her nose began to sniffle.</p> <p>She intended to keep a distance from the Lin Family and be less involved as much as possible, yet the moment she received a call that Liang Mulan had an accident, she was in such a panic that she wished she could have wings just to fly by her side and check up on her.</p>",
  "Chapter 77: Only You Don’t Have the Right": "<p>Before she found out that she wasn’t Liang Mulan’s daughter by blood, she had seen Liang Mulan as her real mother. Despite not having the same blood, their true bond had never changed.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Nuan couldn’t keep lying to herself. She couldn’t say that after getting married and removing herself from the Lin Family document book that she would have nothing to do with them.</p> <p>As long as Liang Mulan was still in the Lin family, as long as her husband was still in the Lin Family, as long as the Lin grandparents and Lin Chen were still in the Lin Family, Lin Nuan would have countless involvements with the Lin Family.</p> <p>The hot water poured out of the kettle. Lin Nuan immediately turned it off. Her movements were too hasty as she held the bottle and the spilled hot water scalded her arm. She immediately retracted her arm and used cool water to rinse it.</p> <p>Fortunately, it wasn’t too serious and the burning sensation was alleviated. Lin Nuan flicked off the water from her hands and took the bottle back to the ward.</p> <p>Lin Chen’s tall figure was standing right in the middle of the hallway, his back facing Lin Nuan’s direction.</p> <p>He was wearing a light blue wide-collar shirt with a navy tie. His defined large hand held a grey checkered slim-fitting suit, his wide shoulders blocking the bright light from the hallway, his shadow enveloping Lin Ran inside of it.</p> <p>The tall Lin Chen stood there without a word. Even so, he still had an exceptionally intimidating presence, not to mention the anger in his handsome eyes. His elegant demeanor was replaced by his steady, decisive presence that was cultivated by making kills and gains in the business world. Lin Ran couldn’t help averting her eyes and feel frightened inside.</p> <p>Yet when Lin Ran saw Lin Nuan making her way towards them with the thermos bottle, she clutched her slim, fair little hands and looked straight up at Lin Chen, “So what if I’m a bastard?” Being a bastard was something forced out by you guys! I pushed Mother down, but she should have minded her own business! I was raised by Lin Nuan’s degenerate father for so many years yet none of you showed me the familial love I deserved. So how can you criticize me by playing the family card now and restrict me from doing what I want?! If you really are that good… then why don’t you disown me and let Lin Nuan be your sister?! Let Lin Nuan be your mother’s precious daughter and I might as well pass away outside!”</p> <p>The vein on the corner of Lin Chen’s forehead kept popping out. He raised his hand and slapped her across her face.</p> <p>Lin Ran let out a short scream and covered her face. Her glance went past Lin Chen and fell on Lin Nuan, full of resentment. Her whole face was covered with tears.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hands clenched together as she held the bottle.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan’s father may be more of a bastard, but he was the one who rescued you from the hospital and raised you. In such a poor environment like that, he never compromised on your clothes and food and sent you to the best school! If it wasn’t for Lin Nuan’s father, you would have died twenty years ago! Mother gave you your first life and Lin Nuan’s father gave you your second! So in this world… Mother can be resentful towards Lin Nuan’s father, Father can be resentful towards Lin Nuan’s father, but only you don’t have that right!”</p> <p>The fine lines around Lin Chen’s eyes were carved deep. His gaze was calm.</p> <p>“Is it just that in your heart you never truly acknowledged me as your sister?” For the first time ever, Lin Ran mustered up the courage to look straight into his deep, unreadable eyes, “You wish I could have passed away twenty years ago! This way… nobody could disturb the loving harmonious life you had with Lin Nuan!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood from a decent distance. Holding the bottle, she wasn’t sure if she should approach them. All she could feel was the increasing pain from her scalded hand.</p> <p>“You and Mother both say that Lin Nuan is innocent, then what about me? My apologies for not blossoming into the classy elegant lady that Grandmother and Grandfather wanted to see! Because I never received the kind of education Lin Nuan had growing up, so I can’t possibly compare to her!”</p>",
  "Chapter 78: Then Do Your Best to Pursue It": "<p>Lin Ran revealed what had touched the saddest part in her heart. Her nose twitched and her tears fell down like a stream.</p> <p>“I’m an unsatisfying sister, an unsatisfying daughter—all I can do is be reckless which Lin Nuan’s father caused by pampering me too much! What you see as my shortcomings isn’t something I can choose. If I have to be extra cautious in front of my own blood-parents, I’m sorry… but I can’t do this. In my heart, all of you people owe me! Especially Lin Nuan! She’s the one who stole everything that belonged to me and turned into what I was supposed to be! She stole my life!”</p> <p>Lin Ran almost screamed out of desperation.</p> <p>The relatives of the patients in the other wards opened their doors and were about to come out and yell at whoever was making so much noise. But as soon as they saw the intimidating Lin Chen, they chose to stand at their doors and watch the scene, without daring to come forward.</p> <p>The nurses from the nurse station were about to stop Lin Ran from making so much noise in the hallway. But as soon as they saw Lin Chen’s furious face, they chose to watch silently.</p> <p>“Didn’t Grandmother say I wasn’t as serene as other girls, that I was tough like a wild-bred horse? I’ll tell you where this came from! Because I was bullied since a kid, chased with rocks by children my age… they hit my head until it was bleeding all over with wounds and said I had a mad mother and that I was a mini-mad kid! If I wasn’t tough in my personality, I’d just get mistreated by even more people! You guys never understood what I went through as a child, what right do you have to criticize me?</p> <p>“What’s wrong with me going to the Gu Family to find Gu Shaoting to let him know I have feelings for him? I should be the one getting engaged to Gu Shaoting! By what right does your mother get to say I have no love for myself? As a child, my experience told me that I should do everything I can to pursue what I want. Even if I can’t get it, at least I gave it all that I had! What kind of lady etiquette is this… what kind of girlish courtesy is this? For me, it’s not nearly as important as my happiness! What’s wrong with me giving my all to pursue the person I like? If the ladies in your upper class are supposed to watch happiness slip right before their very eyes, then all I can say is: I ‘m sorry, but I won’t ever become the lady you all expect to see in this lifetime! Let Lin Nuan be the official lady of the Lin Family! From now on I won’t have anything to do with the Lin Family!”</p> <p>Lin Ran’s chest was heaving up and down. These words had been suppressed in her heart for too long.</p> <p>Even if it was a minute ago, she wouldn’t have imagined herself saying all that to Lin Chen.</p> <p>Lin Ran’s words left Lin Chen slightly in shock.</p> <p>If you like something, you should give everything you have to get it? Really?</p> <p>Looking at the way Lin Ran was staring at him, Lin Nuan didn’t say anything. She left the thermos bottle on the seat in the hallway, then turned around and quietly left.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood at the edge of the stairs at the entrance to the hospital. She looked down and stared at her half-wet black pants and her pair of white sneakers newly stained by mud. She felt empty inside.</p> <p>She’d left in a hurry just then. She had jogged back to the hospital entrance in the rain and then suddenly recalled that her purse was still in Liang Mulan’s ward with her phone and wallet inside. She hesitated whether she should go back to get it.</p> <p>The pouring rain grew weaker until it lightened to just a drizzle from the sky. It was only half past four and the sky began to turn dark and heavy.</p> <p>The soft orange headlights emanating from the hospital entrance morphed into circles of blurry sparks in the rain, enveloping Lin Nuan like a layer of haze.</p> <p>On the wide road, cars passed here and there, their lights intersecting with the colors of the rainbow. Lin Nuan’s sniffed her slightly red nose.</p>",
  "Chapter 79: Do You Want to Be Drenched?": "<p>Lin Nuan had just gone down the stairs a few steps before someone pulled forcefully at her slender hand. Her whole body fell backward, knocking into a solid warm wall as the scent of nicotine infiltrated her sense of smell.</p> <p>Cars flew past puddles, making the water splash up, instantly drenching Lin Nuan’s feet which she had yet to retract; the part of her leg under her right knee felt icy cold.</p> <p>She raised her head to see Fu Huai’an holding her arm with one hand and a black umbrella in the other, a cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth. His strong facial features appeared before her eyes with his brows slightly furrowed, his deep eyes staring at her.</p> <p>Half of the cold bright light from the hospital’s entrance was blocked by the black umbrella and the remaining half fell upon his strong jawline and broad shoulders.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s suit trousers were also half-drenched and his suit was left unbuttoned; the aura of a strong and mature man was intimidating.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan’s blank look, Fu Huai’an’s brows drew in tighter as he released her arm to remove the cigarette from his mouth, saying, “Why are you spacing out while walking, do you want to be soaked?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s thick voice was slightly hoarse from smoking and it contained a hint of gentle anger as though he was lecturing a subordinate, strong and dominating.</p> <p>“Why are you still here?” Lin Nuan slipped out the words without using her brain-to-mouth filter.</p> <p>“I met a friend at the hospital so we chatted for a bit…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t believe Fu Huai’an’s reason.</p> <p>It wasn’t that Lin Nuan had a lot of pride in herself, but it was simply that the timing of Fu Huai’an’s appearance was too much of a coincidence, to the point that Lin Nuan subconsciously felt that he’d been waiting for her.</p> <p>Sensing the disbelief in Lin Nuan’s eyes, Fu Huai’an was just about to open his mouth when he heard someone calling him.</p> <p>“Old Fu!?”</p> <p>Upon hearing the call, Fu Huai’an raised the umbrella and looked towards the main building of the hospital.</p> <p>Only to see a male doctor wearing his white coat and running towards their direction in the light rain, his hand carrying a plastic bag that contained medicine.</p> <p>“Taking the time I was getting medicine to run over here and flirt with someone doesn’t seem like your style!”</p> <p>Bai Jinyu, who had a nameplate that indicated him as the attending physician of the neurosurgery department, soon stood in front of Fu Huai’an and Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Seeing that it was Lin Nuan who was standing under Fu Huai’an’s umbrella, Bai Jinyu laughed and said, “I was wondering who it was and it turned out to be Lin Nuan. No wonder Old Fu didn’t wait for me to collect the medicine before running out here.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was the female anchor of Haicheng’s broadcasting station’s morning news, and she was the woman Fu Huai’an liked, so it wasn’t weird for Bai Jinyu to recognize her.</p> <p>“Hello, I’m Old Fu’s friend, Bai Jinyu, and a doctor at this hospital.”</p> <p>Bai Jinyu’s self-introduction made Lin Nuan feel awkward. She raised her gaze to see a trace of the meaningful smile playing on the corner of Fu Huai’an’s lips.</p> <p>It was very slight but she couldn’t ignore it.</p> <p>Just earlier she had been so full of herself and assumed that Fu Huai’an was waiting here for her. Her ears turned red as Lin Nuan tried her best to act properly and avoid letting others notice her strange behavior.</p> <p>“Nice to meet you,” Lin Nuan said politely in her pleasing voice.</p> <p>After greeting Lin Nuan, Bai Jinyu passed the medicine to Fu Huai’an while nagging at him, saying, “Avoid eating this medicine as much as possible. You can’t always rely on medicine to fall asleep…”</p> <p>“I know.” Fu Huai’an jerked his chin up and took the bag of medicine with his hand still holding his cigarette.</p> <p>Bai Jinyu looked at his wristwatch and said, “Then I’ll leave first, I still have a surgery coming up later.”</p> <p>After he finished speaking, Bai Jinyu nodded towards Lin Nuan with a smile while Lin Nuan returned a slight smile of her own.</p>",
  "Chapter 80: If I Said I Was Waiting For You": "<p>After Bai Jinyu left, the duo under the umbrella entered a weird and awkward silence.</p> <p>Lin Nuan lowered her eyes and felt her soaked pants clinging tightly to her lower thighs. When the wind blew over, it was so cold it made her shiver.</p> <p>She tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear to hide some of the embarrassment in her heart before opening her mouth to say, “I’m sorry, just now… It was such a coincidence to meet you here, I thought you were waiting for me.”</p> <p>Among the noise of the car honks and tires splashing through the water puddles, Lin Nuan heard Fu Huai’an’s deep voice sounding beside her ear sensually.</p> <p>“If I said I was waiting for you…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan clenched her fists and her heart skipped a beat. She tried to control herself and not reveal the fluttering of her heart.</p> <p>She looked away, lowering her head and not knowing where to place her gaze, but the move accidentally exposed her gradually reddening ears and elegant neckline to Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“Are you getting on my car?” Fu Huai’an asked calmly, his relaxed tone that of someone superior.</p> <p>In Lin Nuan’s eyes, she saw Fu Huai’an’s hand holding the plastic bag and cigarette, white smoke rising from between his fingers, making her heartbeat increase involuntarily.</p> <p>( Box novel.c om )   Seeing Lin Nuan who was turning red from shyness, Fu Huai’an felt stirred up and his Adam’s apple bobbed slightly.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan.” Fu Huai’an called Lin Nuan’s name, his tone sounding slightly heavy as he added, “Answer me.”</p> <p>As though Lin Nuan’s reply was an important decision.</p> <p>Lin Nuan actually felt her heart panicking.</p> <p>She felt Fu Huai’an’s strong masculine scent filling in between her breaths, mixed with the smell of nicotine and the faint hint of mint.</p> <p>What made her uneasy was the forceful tone of Fu Huai’an’s voice.</p> <p>The rain started getting heavier once more and the continuous raindrops hit the umbrella, as though they were drumming down in an attempt to urge Lin Nuan to answer.</p> <p>Under the cross of the double rainbows, the pedestrians cursed at the ever-changing weather as they rushed to avoid the rain, the water in the puddles splashing up under their feet.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was protected closely under Fu Huai’an’s umbrella, and she lowered her head to see the blurry traffic lights through the column of water trickling down as her fingers played with the corner of her shirt.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an lowered the umbrella and leaned closer towards Lin Nuan, using the hand holding the cigarette to hold her chin up so he could meet her gaze. In the busy street, on a rainy day, the pose looked extremely intimate.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s heart thundered against her chest and she subconsciously tried to step back, saying, “Don’t be like this!”</p> <p>She tore her gaze away and used her hand to hold Fu Huai’an’s wrist, feeling his slightly cold watch that was peeking out from under his sleeve under her palm.</p> <p>“Like what?</p> <p>The scenery behind Fu Huai’an’s back was colorful as he slightly tightened his hold on Lin Nuan’s chin, forcing her to face him as he lowered his thick voice on purpose. It was obviously a teasing sentence, but these two words sounded especially seductive in the dark and rainy weather, making Lin Nuan’s ears redden involuntarily.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hand around Fu Huai’an’s wrist started perspiring and she had no choice but to raise her head. The shyness between her brows grew clearer and even her eyes were covered in a layer of mist.</p> <p>“We’re in public, how can you act like this?!”</p> <p>Her voice slightly trembled.</p> <p>“You mean, as long as we’re not in public, I can do whatever I want?” Fu Huai’an opened his mouth to shoot back.</p> <p>One sentence was enough for Lin Nuan to feel both shame and fury and she forcefully pried Fu Huai’an’s hand away from her chin. Before she could open her mouth, her lips were sealed by Fu Huai’an’s cold lips.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s mind blanked instantly, the intensity of the rain hitting the umbrella the only sound left in her ears.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an pulled the umbrella extremely low and covered the two of them.</p>",
  "Chapter 81: Once More Entering Fu Huai’an’s Embrace": "<p>The man’s mature breaths mixed with the smell of cigarettes engulfed her, his warm chest chasing away the coldness brought by the cold wind, but Lin Nuan’s still felt goosebumps, her whole body shivering.</p> <p>The rain grew heavier and heavier. Someone used a bag to cover their head as they ran in their high heels towards shelter to avoid the rain. It was a young lady dressed in office attire. Not noticing where she was going, she stepped into a hole in the road and her body bumped into Lin Nuan’s shoulder, pushing her into Fu Huai’an’s arms.</p> <p>“Sorry sorry…”</p> <p>The rain was so heavy that the young lady’s glasses were covered by the raindrops and she couldn’t see who she’d bumped into, so she apologized hurriedly before rushing off again.</p> <p>The kiss broke off from the accident and Lin Nuan was already running out of breath, her face a patch of crimson. Her expression of shyness was clearly visible.</p> <p>The air was filled with embarrassment. Lin Nuan looked at the shoulder that was knocked into to cover up her awkwardness.</p> <p>She thought the kiss would end there, but the man pulled her face back with his large hand and leaned over once more.</p> <p>She grasped onto his wrist, the face of his ice-cold watch slick with Lin Nuan’s sweat.</p> <p>After a short pause from surprise, she tried to push Fu Huai’an away but his slightly rough hand locked her wrist and brought her hand around his narrow waist, pulling her towards him even more.</p> <p>Tripping over her feet, Lin Nuan bumped into Fu Huai’an’s embrace once more.</p> <p>Her arm was under Fu Huai’an’s thick suit, her palm only one thin shirt away from his back, the temperature of his skin burning her hand and disrupting her mind.</p> <p>Lin Nuan wanted to withdraw her arm but Fu Huai’an hugged her even tighter.</p> <p>Through the kiss, her mouth was completely full of the man’s strong taste and the air in her lungs was stolen away by him, her tongue growing tired.</p> <p>Lin Nuan couldn’t deny that Fu Huai’an’s kiss stirred up the desire in her. His experienced ways made her unable to resist.</p> <p>Her actions of resistance grew smaller and weaker as time passed before eventually ceasing, to the point where her legs turned to jelly and she could only grab onto Fu Huai’an’s shirt from the back to barely support herself upright.</p> <p>Lin Chen held Lin Nuan’s small bag in his hand as he stood at the top of the stairs at the entrance of the hospital…</p> <p>He saw the duo who were stuck closely together under the black umbrella, his heart feeling something he couldn’t quite phrase.</p> <p>The black umbrella covered their faces but Lin Chen could still make out Lin Nuan’s figure.</p> <p>Even though he wasn’t smoking, his mouth tasted bitter.</p> <p>His hand tightened onto the poor bag which was small in his large hand, his knuckles clear and visible, but his eyes remained calm like a pool of dead water, dark and distant.</p> <p>After some time passed, Lin Nuan started feeling dizzy, maybe because of the lack of oxygen or because of her stirred up lust. When Fu Huai’an finally released her lips, his deep black eyes watched the misty desire in her eyes, making her appearance more attractive.</p> <p>“Go to my place, or return to yours?</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s thick voice was slightly hoarse, sounding extremely sexy.</p> <p>Lin Nuan whose brain had still felt mushy immediately cleared up, and she withdrew her hand from the man’s shirt, angry with embarrassment. Looking at him, her feelings of anger showing outwardly as she asked, “What do you mean by that?”</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan’s guarded stance, Fu Huai’an asked, “You had no feelings towards that kiss?”</p> <p>As adults, the feeling Fu Huai’an meant… Lin Nuan naturally understood.</p> <p>And it was exactly because she understood, which was why Lin Nuan was especially angry at Fu Huai’an—and more so at herself—for getting heated up from that kiss.</p>",
  "Chapter 82: Who Let You Make It?": "<p>Lin Nuan guessed Fu Huai’an was definitely thinking that Lin Nuan herself was into it too, and her ears involuntarily turned red as she glared at him angrily, as though she was being wrongly accused.</p> <p>The man said that he was going to get married to her but made her take back her passport afterward. And he’d even kissed her in front of the hospital and saying such disgusting words—what exactly did he mean by that?</p> <p>Without any clear communication, the two seemed very intimate and Lin Nuan was unable to stand on the moral high ground to blame Fu Huai’an for treating her like that.</p> <p>In his heart, since she’d already done it with him once, did Fu Huai’an take her to be a woman who would always be there for him to have s*x with outside of marriage?</p> <p>“Mr. Fu…” Lin Nuan’s fists clenched tight by her side. She opened her mouth after adjusting her emotions, her clear voice almost washed away by the noise of the heavy rain hitting against the umbrella.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an stared at Lin Nuan, his deep facial features reflected in her eyes. The man’s strong and heavy aura enveloped her, forcing Lin Nuan’s words to be stuck at her throat as she lost the courage to say them aloud.</p> <p>She lowered her eyes and knitted her brows together, saying, “I think we have to clear things up.”</p> <p>“What do we need to clear up?” The corner of Fu Huai’an’s lips had a subtle smile and he stuck one hand in his pocket, looking as though he’d easily removed himself from his earlier state of lust and had recovered his proper posture.</p> <p>On the other hand, Lin Nuan was still out of breath and her fast heartbeat showed no signs of slowing down.</p> <p>“At first, I went to you to ask that you not marry Gu Hanyan, and I also promised to get married to you as a replacement for Gu Hanyan to be your woman and Tuan Tuan’s mother…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s smile remained and he spoke with his attractive voice, saying, “So since Wen Moshen has returned, you intend to let me marry Gu Hanyan so you and Wen Moshen can get together?”</p> <p>Fu Huaian’s words were probing.</p> <p>Lin Nuan kept silent.</p> <p>“I never had the intention to be together with Mo… Wen Moshen.” Lin Nuan replied and looked straight at Fu Huai’an in an upright manner. “Although I’m not a gentlewoman, neither am I a dishonest and vile person. I will still stick to the contract and if you want to get married, I will do so. But if you decide not to marry me because you think that my personality is boring or I’m not your preferred type of woman that will accept you fooling around outside after marriage, I too will be very grateful—but I refuse to kiss you or even go to bed with you without being clear on where we stand right now.”</p> <p>The “boring personality” tag was given by Wen Moshen, and Lin Nuan smoothly used it.</p> <p>Lin Nuan indeed had a stuffy personality; Wen Moshen once joked that Lin Nuan was the most boring and uninteresting closed gourd and one that even came with thorns.</p> <p>The words ‘go to bed with’, Lin Nuan could barely say them out loud.</p> <p>Having feelings when kissing made Lin Nuan guilty, but from a biological perspective, she had an excuse: was it not normal for a mature woman’s body to react towards a man?</p> <p>“Who gave you the conclusion that you have a boring personality?” Fu Huai’an’s tone sounded interrogating.</p> <p>The moment he finished speaking, the phone in his suit jacket started vibrating so he took it out and lowered his head to look at the caller ID, the blue light from the screen tracing his features and making them seem even more deeply carved.</p> <p>Hanging up and placing his phone back into his pocket, he resumed his firm and upright position in front of Lin Nuan.</p> <p>In Fu Huai’an’s eyes, in which aspect was Lin Nuan boring? Her eyes betrayed her shyness and she obviously looked attractive and seductive.</p>",
  "Chapter 83: Do You Want To Try?": "<p>The words ‘Wen Moshen’ were stuck in Lin Nuan’s throat and she pursed her lips, keeping quiet.</p> <p>Silence gradually hung between the two before Lin Nuan heard the slight sound of Fu Huai’an’s phone vibrating again, and she looked over. Noticing that the phone was in Fu Huai’an’s pants, Lin Nuan looked away again with reddened ears.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an still didn’t pick up. He held the umbrella with one hand, using the other to take out a box of cigarettes and drew one out, lighting it up.</p> <p>Just as Lin Nuan thought that their conversation was going to end in silence, she heard the man say, “Since you’re very grateful to not get married to me, how do you want to thank me?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was slightly stunned.</p> <p>She probably didn’t think that Fu Huai’an would ask her such a question on how to show her appreciation. From a normal person’s understanding, it would all end with being grateful. Who would ask how to thank them?</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Nuan didn’t reply, Fu Huai’an tapped the cigarette and added, “What, don’t tell me… You thought just saying the words ‘very grateful’ would be enough? Nowadays, the words ‘very grateful’ are merely a touch of the lips, and not something worth much.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan pursed her lips tightly. Fu Huai’an’s words made it sound as though Lin Nuan made him receive the much shorter end of the stick.</p> <p>In Lin Nuan’s head, all the possible ways of thanking someone would undoubtedly involve material compensation, but Fu Huai’an was not lacking in those.</p> <p>He’d said before that what he lacked was a woman that would be, at the same time, his son’s mother.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s stubbornness crashed over and she looked at Fu Huai’an, saying, “Mr. Fu is saying that you want me to beg you to marry me?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an bit onto the cigarette from the corner of his mouth and he loomed over her with one hand in his pocket, looking all the more mysterious and unreadable through the screen of white smoke.</p> <p>After a long time, Fu Huai’an opened his mouth to speak with puffs of white smoke escaping his mouth, saying, “Lin Nuan, since you’re unwilling to get married to me, how about we understand each other first before the marriage?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was shocked.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was sure that her own ability to understand wasn’t bad, but she took a while to digest the meaning in Fu Huai’an’s words.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was saying that despite Lin Nuan’s unwillingness, they still had to get married, but before the marriage, he could date Lin Nuan so they could get to know each other better, is that what he meant?</p> <p>Afraid that she was overthinking things again, Lin Nuan asked, “What does Mr. Fu mean?”</p> <p>Under the heavy rain, Lin Nuan watched Fu Huaian’s thin lips part and close, her expression changing to that of surprise.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After Lin Nuan reached her home and took a shower, she still felt like it was all extremely unreal.</p> <p>She sat on the soft white rug in the bedroom and crossed her legs while staring at the heavy rain outside the window, blanking out.</p> <p>Today under the black umbrella, she asked Fu Huai’an what he meant…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an stared at her with his deep gaze and half-lidded eyes as he spoke slowly with a deep voice, “Let’s date before we get married, do you want to try it?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an spoke casually, but it made the anger in Lin Nuan’s heart disappear completely for some unknown reason. Instead, it was replaced by an increase in her heartbeat and complete panic.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t reply. She could no longer remain calm and reserved, not knowing how to answer him…</p> <p>Dating, shouldn’t it be done with someone she loved?</p> <p>From the beginning, the two had never started off because of love.</p> <p>Thinking of the word ‘dating’, Lin Nuan unavoidably felt panicked and uneasy.</p> <p>Although there were plenty of men who wooed Lin Nuan ever since she started middle school, Lin Nuan had never had a single experience in dating apart from her secret love for Wen Moshen. How to date… was an extremely troublesome question for Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Even though it was clearly a dating experience that would result in marriage no matter what, but once Lin Nuan thought of it she would feel tense and guarded as though she was facing a difficult enemy. Which part of her resembled the sweet and blissful appearance of a woman who was passionately in love?</p>",
  "Chapter 84: I Don’t Have Suitable Slippers Here": "<p>Lin Nuan looked out the glass window with a distant gaze…</p> <p>The busy Haicheng was covered under the rainbows, the bright colored specks blurring amidst the mist, decorating Haicheng’s night scenery.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face as she was deep in thought was reflected on the transparent glass dotted with rain.</p> <p>“Ding-dong—”</p> <p>Hearing the ringing of the doorbell, Lin Nuan returned to her senses and stood up to answer the door with her towel around her neck.</p> <p>Learning from the previous lesson, Lin Nuan did not open the door directly. Wearing a jacket over her clothes, she looked out the peephole.</p> <p>Lin Chen’s tall and broad figure stood outside the door, his suit jacket neat and stiff as he held in his hands the bag she’d left in the hospital earlier that day.</p> <p>The office lady neighbor who came back from her overtime work saw a man standing outside Lin Nuan’s door. As a single lady, she couldn’t help look over curiously…</p> <p>Lin Chen who was in his early 30s not only had an elegant look but also the steady and strong vibe of a successful man.</p> <p>Even if Lin Chen’s suit was informal and he’d left the jacket unbuttoned, he hadn’t fastened on a tie and the first few buttons of his shirt were also unbuttoned, Lin Nuan’s secretary neighbor could accurately guess that Lin Chen belonged to the upper-class.</p> <p>A member of the upper-class… They always had a strong and intimidating vibe about them and could easily dominate others without having to do so intentionally.</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Chen’s hand held onto a lady’s handbag, the neighbor showed her distaste with a twitch of her lips. A female anchor and a member of the upper-class—it didn’t need much imagination for people to easily draw up an image of an exchange of power and one’s body.</p> <p>Getting no reply, he pressed the doorbell once more.</p> <p>Just as Lin Nuan’s neighbor was entering her door, she turned to take a proper look at Lin Chen only to see his handsome profile that had a coldness to it. She felt her heartbeat pick up the pace for a while.</p> <p>Lin Chen, the President of the Lin organization, she had seen Lin Chen’s photo on a magazine before and had had fantasies about his attractively elegant and masculine face.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Chen’s deep eyes glance sideways at her, her face reddened in shyness. Just as the neighbor who had faith in her looks was wondering whether or not to greet him, Lin Nuan opened the door.</p> <p>“Brother…”</p> <p>Seeing Lin Chen holding onto her bag through the peephole, Lin Nuan didn’t ask the obvious but simply greeted him.</p> <p>Lin Chen looked at Lin Nuan; her wet long hair was tucked behind her ears, revealing her delicate ears and the gentle line of her jaw. Her aura remained refreshing mixed with some warmth and gentleness, causing Lin Chen’s gaze to deepen.</p> <p>“You left your bag in the hospital today so Mom told me to come over and give it to you. She also has some stuff she wants you to know…” Lin Chen’s deep and thick voice sounded a bit hoarse, the power of someone who had been used to being part of the upper class seeping through.</p> <p>Lin Nuan left without even taking her bag. Lin Chen and Liang Mulan knew that Lin Nuan must have heard Lin Ran’s untimely words so she chose to leave quietly.</p> <p>She pursed her lips and opened the door, inviting Lin Chen inside.</p> <p>It was Lin Chen’s first time stepping into the apartment Lin Nuan rented. It wasn’t big but it was clean and homely, full of Lin Nuan’s traces, making it very comfortable.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Chen casually place her bag onto the shoe cabinet but didn’t rush to go in, Lin Nuan said, “I don’t have suitable slippers here, just enter like this, Brother…”</p> <p>As she walked towards the kitchen, Lin Nuan asked, “Do you want to drink the red tea Mom brought over last time or plain water?”</p> <p>Lin Chen raised his feet and his polished leather shoes stepped onto the spotless floor, his gaze following her back as he replied, “Plain water is fine.”</p>",
  "Chapter 85: A Stab To The Heart": "<p>Lin Nuan remembered that Lin Chen only drank West Lake’s Longjing tea specifically harvested before a rain, but she didn’t have any, so she asked him if he wanted red tea.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan boil water in the kitchen, Lin Chen stood still in the living room as he took in Lin Nuan’s living environment. His gaze fell on the passport placed on the coffee table so he bent down to pick it up.</p> <p>After flipping a page, it showed Fu Huai’an’s name, and Lin Chen narrowed his black eyes.</p> <p>Lin Nuan carried out the cups and saw Lin Chen looking at the passports, and she said, “Brother, drink some water…”</p> <p>“When are you going to hold the wedding?</p> <p>Lin Chen’s voice remained calm and neutral as he placed the passport back.</p> <p>“We don’t know. We didn’t get to sign the certificate the last time…”</p> <p>Lin Chen glanced to the side and watched as Lin Nuan bent over to place the cups onto the coffee table. His usually deep and calm gaze had a touch of emotion to them. He removed his blazer and casually placed it on the one-seater before sitting down, asking, “Why didn’t you manage to sign it?”</p> <p>Sitting down, Lin Chen took out his gold lighter to open it, but eventually closed it and put it back down.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was unable to truthfully say that they were going to date before getting married, so she said, “Before we get married, we want to have more time to understand each other…”</p> <p>Under the light, Lin Chen nodded his head approvingly and reached over to take the glass that still had hot steam rising from it, lowering his gaze as he blew at the liquid. The rising mist blurred his deeply carved features and he took a sip before saying, “Mm, you should try and understand each other better.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan recalled that before Lin Chen came in, he said that he had something to tell her, so she watched as he put down the glass and sat down. She held onto her left wrist with her right hand before deciding to open her mouth first, asking, “Did Mom blame me for leaving without saying a word?”</p> <p>Lin Chen glanced at her with an unreadable expression, saying, “You still know that?”</p> <p>She tightened her grasp on her wrist and said in a lowered voice, “Brother, I just thought that if I kept appearing in front of all of you, it would be unfair for Lin Ran…”</p> <p>Hearing Lin Nuan’s words, Lin Chen furrowed his brows slightly and he subconsciously reached for his cigarettes box. In the end, he put it down the moment he took it out.</p> <p>“You can smoke, it’s fine…” Lin Nuan’s voice was soft as she stood up to open the windows. “I’ll just open the windows.”</p> <p>She heard Liang Mulan say that these years when Lin Chen had taken over the Lin organization, he had been rather tired and stressed. It was just that Lin Chen and Lin Nuan were both similarly introverted and were unwilling to say it out loud. Instead, his smoking addiction grew heavier as the days passed to the extent where he needed to have a cigarette in his hand at all times.</p> <p>Lin Nuan could tell that ever since Lin Chen entered her apartment, he had been trying to hold back.</p> <p>The pouring rain outside had yet to stop so once Lin Nuan opened the window, the cool air mixed with moisture blew inside with a flurry.</p> <p>Lin Chen took out a cigarette and watched Lin Nuan’s back as she tugged at the translucent curtains gently. He moved the cigarette to his lips before lowering his gaze to light it up.</p> <p>Hearing the sound of Lin Nuan sitting back down, Lin Chen took a puff of the cigarette as his dark gaze looked at Lin Nuan, asking, “Unfair towards Lin Ran, but by not interacting with us, your family, is that fair to you?”</p> <p>He saw Lin Nuan opening her mouth.</p> <p>“All these years, Dad and Mom… and me, our relationships with you aren’t computer programs, they can’t be deleted just because someone said so. Tell me, how different are your actions from taking a knife and stabbing it in our family’s hearts?”</p> <p>Lin Chen spoke smoothly, his deep voice was stable and sounded extremely convincing and trustworthy, making his words a stab to the heart.</p> <p>After speaking, Lin Chen took a look at the cigarette between his fingers and asked, “Do you have any disposable cups?”</p> <p>The rims of Lin Nuan’s eyes reddened and she had no words to defend herself with, so she could only nod her head and stood up, saying, “I’ll go get one…”</p>",
  "Chapter 86: What Is This?": "<p>Lin Nuan brought a clean disposable cup to Lin Chen and he received it with his cigarette-wielding hand to place it on the coffee table. After pouring in some hot water from the glass cup, he then tapped the cigarette ashes into the disposable cup.</p> <p>She lowered her head and thought Lin Chen still had something to say, but up until Lin Chen smoked his last cigarette, not once did he open his mouth to speak another sentence.</p> <p>Hearing the sound of the cigarette butt being thrown into the disposable cup, Lin Nuan raised her head.</p> <p>Lin Chen took out a sapphire velvet box from his pocket and placed it in front of Lin Nuan, the knuckles of his hand clear and visible.</p> <p>“What is this?” Lin Nuan asked.</p> <p>“That year you left home, this is the birthday present I originally wanted to give to you.” Lin Chen’s tone was plain and neutral.</p> <p>He stood up and put on his jacket before bending down to pick up the cigarette box and lighter. He then fixed his gaze on Lin Nuan’s fair and beautiful face, saying, “If you’re free tomorrow, go and visit Mom. She’ll be happy…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan tightened her hand around the long and thin box that she hadn’t had the chance to open and stood up with Lin Chen, keeping silent.</p> <p>After sending Lin Chen off, Lin Nuan sat on the sofa for a very long time, spacing out as she stared at the glass of water Lin Chen never finished drinking.</p> <p>A cold draft of wind blew over and Lin Nuan’s arm started feeling chilled. Just as she was about to stand up and close the window, she realized that she was still holding on to the box Lin Chen gave her.</p> <p>Opening it, there lay a refined dainty necklace inside. Her nose felt a pang of pain as she was dragged back into her memories.</p> <p>Four years ago, on that bright and sunny afternoon, the light shone in from the large tall window and brightened up the whole room.</p> <p>After lunch, Lin Nuan and Liang Mulan were sitting on the sofa and flipping through the magazine while they discussed fashion trends. Lin Chen was upstairs packing his luggage for his business trip to France with their father.</p> <p>The mother and daughter pair were talking about the jewelry on the model when Lin Chen quietly crept up behind the two. When he heard Lin Nuan say that the dainty necklace hanging on the model’s neck was pretty, he said, “Then I’ll buy it for your birthday present!”</p> <p>At the time, Lin Nuan and Liang Mulan got a shock and their father walked downstairs, tidying up his collar while reprimanding Lin Chen for being too lazy and choosing his sister’s gift like that.</p> <p>Such a bright and blissful memory had been sealed inside Lin Nuan’s heart for so many years, to the point where a thin layer of dust seemed to have collected over it.</p> <p>But seeing the exact same dainty necklace today, the memory appeared clearly and exactly in Lin Nuan’s mind, seeming both extremely heart-warming and extremely mocking.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After the morning news, Lin Nuan was called into the office by Miss Xia, who gave her a document on the preparation of a new program.</p> <p>Lin Nuan took over the document and glanced at it. The title was “A Sunday Date”, but she didn’t flip to read the contents, choosing to look at Miss Xia instead.</p> <p>“This program has been in preparation for a while. It’s slotted to be in the golden timeslot of Sunday at 8 p.m. You should have also seen the advertising done a while ago…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s heart thundered greatly for a moment—she understood Miss Xia’s meaning behind giving her the document.</p> <p>She said, “This program, did Miss Xia think of recommending Bai Xiaonian?”</p> <p>Miss Xia drew out a thin long lady’s cigarette and looked at Lin Nuan. After a moment of silence, she said, “You didn’t even look at the contents before recommending Bai Xiaonian. Do you miss the morning news department or are you standing up for your best friend?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan pursed her lips, but before she could think of a reply, Miss Xia brought the cigarette to her lips and lit it up, continuing, “I personally think that… Bai Xiaonian suits the morning news more than you.”</p> <p>Hearing Miss Xia say that meant that Lin Nuan would go on “A Sunday Date” while Bai Xiaonian would go on the morning news. Lin Nuan’s tightened brows relaxed in relief.</p>",
  "Chapter 87: I’ll Accompany You Up": "<p>Thud thud thud—</p> <p>Hearing the knocking sound, Lin Nuan turned her head to see Bai Xiaonian standing outside the door, asking, “Miss Xia, you asked to see me?”</p> <p>Miss Xia removed her white blazer and her name tag and placed them aside, pointing at the seat beside Lin Nuan as she told Bai Xiaonian, “Sit.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian and Lin Nuan exchanged a glance. Seeing the slight smile on the corner of Lin Nuan’s lips, Bai Xiaonian felt relieved and sat beside Lin Nuan, looking at Miss Xia who was standing behind the office desk.</p> <p>“If you come over to the morning news department, do you have confidence that your viewer ratings will surpass that of Lin Nuan’s?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian paused for a short while, and her red-painted nails sunk into her palm as she clenched her fists, replying with a dark gaze, “I’ve already decided to change my job. I no longer have any interest in this industry.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian guessed that Lin Nuan willingly gave her position to her so that she wouldn’t give up on her dreams. Bai Xiaonian wasn’t a saint or someone who liked to stand on the morally high end. If it was anyone apart from Lin Nuan doing it, she would accept it without any guilt. After all, someone else was giving it to her willingly, why shouldn’t she accept it? But Lin Nuan was different!</p> <p>Miss Xia smiled angrily upon hearing those words.</p> <p>“The two of you are loyal to each other indeed!” Miss Xia sucked in a breath of nicotine and sat down opposite Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian—a rare scene—saying, “I’m letting you go on the morning news because I think that you suit it better than Lin Nuan. Lin Nuan is going on another program, and this program… only Lin Nuan can do it.”</p> <p>These words made Lin Nuan the confused one instead.</p> <p>“The Wen family’s oldest son finally returns after missing for four years because of a flight gone wrong. Up until now, apart from the related departments who have gone to investigate and ask some questions, he has not accepted any media interviews. This time, the station wants to make a big impact for “A Sunday Date” and they want to invite the Wen’s oldest son on the show and he has agreed on the condition that Lin Nuan must be the host!”</p> <p>Miss Xia explained it calmly before reaching over to the ashtray to get rid of some cigarette ash, then continued, “Perfect timing. Lin Nuan was already a potential candidate for the show, so the station has decided to let Lin Nuan go on it…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan paused in surprise.</p> <p>“The information is in your hands. You should hurry up and prepare for your trip to the hospital… The interview with the Wen family’s oldest son is in the hospital this time since he’s still hospitalized, so you’ll have to be burdened for a while!” Miss Xia spoke without hesitation.</p> <p>These past few days, Lin Nuan purposely neglected any news on Wen Moshen, suppressing herself as she was unwilling to go and visit him. She didn’t think that, ultimately, she would be unable to avoid him and had no choice but to go.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan’s hand on her knee clench into a fist, Bai Xiaonian kept quiet despite her surprise.</p> <p>Wen Moshen was the injury in Lin Nuan’s heart, and Bai Xiaonian knew that…</p> <p>…</p> <p>One of Haicheng’s hospitals.</p> <p>Lin Nuan held onto the data that she had already read through as she remained seated on the passenger seat, unable to leave the car for a long time.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian held onto the steering wheel and said to Lin Nuan, “I’ll accompany you up…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head and grabbed the bag in the backseat, tidying up the files in her arms before opening the car door and replying, “I can do it by myself.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan was very clear on where Wen Moshen’s ward was so once she exited the elevator, she walked straight to his ward, her heart feeling somewhat uneasy.</p> <p>Inside the ward, the nurse was just applying medicine on Wen Moshen’s legs. The nurse accidentally made it hurt and apologized continuously to Wen Moshen, but Wen Moshen remained gentle and elegant as he smiled and said that it was ok.</p> <p>Hearing Wen Moshen’s familiar voice, Lin Nuan’s eyes reddened and she took a deep breath to regain control over her emotions before pushing the door open.</p> <p>Wen Moshen’s dark gaze looked over towards the door…</p>",
  "Chapter 88: We Didn’t Meet for a Few Years and We’re Distant Now?": "<p>Their gazes met and Lin Nuan gripped onto the files in her arms. Her nose started to sting and a rush of heat filled her eyes.</p> <p>Her footsteps stopped the moment Wen Moshen’s gaze looked over to her.</p> <p>She originally wanted to act naturally and say, ‘Moshen, you’re back!’</p> <p>But her throat felt as though it had been clogged with cotton, sore and aching, making her unable to speak a single word.</p> <p>She’d had countless dreams of Wen Moshen’s return, to the point that any excitement in Lin Nuan’s heart had turned to numbness. Her heart was left with only a patch of sour and deep sadness.</p> <p>Wen Moshen didn’t speak either. He focused on Lin Nuan with a deep and unreadable gaze.</p> <p>The young nurse saw that Wen Moshen had a visitor so she quickly packed up the medicine and walked towards the door, politely saying to Lin Nuan, “Excuse me… Please let me pass!”</p> <p>Only then did Lin Nuan realize that she was blocking the doorway so she quickly turned to the side to give her space.</p> <p>After the nurse left, Lin Nuan acted calm and casually closed the ward’s door.</p> <p>Inside the ward, the silence was suffocating.</p> <p>“Come over and sit down.”</p> <p>Wen Moshen opened his mouth first, his voice deep and slightly hoarse, sounding as though he was concealing and bearing with his inner emotions.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had no choice but to sit on the chair next to Wen Moshen’s bed.</p> <p>The ward’s door opened once more.</p> <p>“I bought the crab roe pao, but it’s not from the store you like. That store—”</p> <p>Gu Hanyan’s voice stopped and her eyes shook at the sight of Lin Nuan before she calmed down and smiled at her, saying, “Nuan Nuan is finally here. These past few days Moshen has been constantly nagging about how you haven’t come to visit him!”</p> <p>Towards Gu Hanyan being in that kind of scandal, Wen Moshen could even choose to forgive her. It was probably… an extreme love that he had for her, so he could choose not to mind!</p> <p>Just as Lin Nuan was distracted, Gu Hanyan had already walked to the other side of the bed and opened the box of hot and steaming crab roe paos, asking Lin Nuan, “Nuan Nuan do you want to try some?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head but before she could answer verbally, Wen Moshen said, “She doesn’t like crab roe.”</p> <p>Her fingers tightened around the files and the corner of her lips tilted up, her eyes feeling even more like crying.</p> <p>“Then you two can have a casual chat first, I’ll go wash some fruits for Nuan Nuan.”</p> <p>The bathroom door remained open so Lin Nuan could hear the sound of water splashing as Gu Hanyan washed the fruits from where she stood.</p> <p>She opened the file and took out a few pages of documents to pass to Wen Moshen, saying, “You can take a look first. If there are any questions that shouldn’t be asked, tell me in advance and we can negotiate it.”</p> <p>Wen Moshen looked at the information Lin Nuan passed over, taking them with his large hand, but he didn’t go over them.</p> <p>“You didn’t come to see me because you were especially busy?” he asked.</p> <p>Since Wen Moshen was asked straight out, Lin Nuan nodded briskly, replying, “I just got on the morning news so I still wasn’t used to it, and now I also have to prepare for the new program…”</p> <p>Wen Moshen watched Lin Nuan silently until Gu Hanyan carried out the fruits. Wen Moshen then picked up the documents to look through them.</p> <p>Gu Hanyan took a seat on the other side of the bed and clumsily tried to peel an apple for Lin Nuan, but she accidentally cut her fingers and she took in a sharp intake of cold air at the pain.</p> <p>“Why are you so careless?” Wen Moshen’s voice was calm and neutral.</p> <p>Gu Hanyan held onto her fingers and stood up, saying cutely with a smile, “Because I’m stupid! I’ll go to the nurses’ station and ask for a band-aid. You can chat without me first.”</p> <p>The ward was once again left with only the two.</p> <p>The apple that was half peeled by Gu Hanyan remained in the fruit plate so Wen Moshen put the documents aside and reached for the apple and the fruit knife. He fixed his deep gaze on the apple and continued Gu Hanyan’s task of peeling it, passing it to Lin Nuan once he was done.</p> <p>“Thank you…” Lin Nuan took the apple but it remained in her palm and she did not eat it.</p> <p>He took a tissue and wiped his fingers seriously while he said with a deep voice, “Nuan Nuan, we haven’t met for a few years and already we’re distant now?”</p>",
  "Chapter 89: Why Didn’t You Come?": "<p>Lin Nuan kept silent and she heard Wen Moshen’s almost inaudible sigh.</p> <p>“Is Mushroom still well?”</p> <p>At the mention of Mushroom, the heat rushed up to Lin Nuan’s eyes once more and she almost couldn’t resist her tears, so she lowered her head even more, saying, “Mushroom is no longer around.”</p> <p>Wen Moshen’s fingers paused and once he finished wiping his hand, he clenched the tissue in his fist, asking, “When did that happen?”</p> <p>“The day you came back.”</p> <p>“Ah…”</p> <p>Wen Moshen gave a heavy sound as his answer, making it impossible to decipher his emotions.</p> <p>“So, you were afraid that I’d be upset and that’s why you didn’t dare to come see me?”</p> <p>Wen Moshen gave Lin Nuan an excuse for why she didn’t visit him after such a long time.</p> <p>But Lin Nuan was unable to nod without a guilty conscience, so she kept her silence.</p> <p>“When I passed Mushroom to you that year, it was already old, and none of us can change the ways of life of going through birth, aging, sickness, and death. I was already mentally prepared for it. But Nuan Nuan, I’ve been back for so long, and even those un-important people came to see me. Why didn’t you?”</p> <p>Wen Moshen’s voice was clearly calm and neutral, but his question made Lin Nuan speechless.</p> <p>She could hear the meaning behind Wen Moshen’s words—he wasn’t prepared for Lin Nuan to not come and visit him, so he was sad. That’s what he meant.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t know how to answer. Perhaps it was because she had different kinds of feelings towards Wen Moshen in her heart so she was unable to remain so self-righteous in front of him. She kept thinking that no matter what she said, it would sound too intimate.</p> <p>Wen Moshen’s gaze focused on Lin Nuan without shifting even for a moment.</p> <p>So he didn’t miss the way Lin Nuan’s slender fingers clenched slightly and the micro-action of Lin Nuan lowering her head even further.</p> <p>Wen Moshen’s Adam’s apple bobbled slightly and he decided to stop making things difficult for her, but when he spoke, his voice sounded distant, “Nuan Nuan, after I spent so much effort to come back here, I realized that a lot of things have changed…”</p> <p>His words made Lin Nuan remember that a few days ago at the entrance of the cafe, Gu Hanyan had once said that in the four years Wen Moshen had been missing, everything that belonged to him had been taken away by his younger brother, Wen Moshi! She didn’t want to see that when Wen Moshen returned, he would find that he had nothing left.</p> <p>These words coming from Gu Hanyan, her heart would ache, but coming from Wen Moshen, her heart hurt even more.</p> <p>Lin Nuan clenched her fists.</p> <p>“So Nuan Nuan, I don’t want the friendship between us… to change too.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s eyes were uncomfortably sore and the rims were visibly reddened.</p> <p>“En… I understand.” Lin Nuan’s suppressed voice trembled, and it was deep with a heavy muffled sound.</p> <p>Between them, there were some words, that as long as Lin Nuan never said them, she would still be Wen Moshen’s good friend and Lin Chen’s younger sister. That would never change. Lin Nuan would bury her feelings under the deepest corner of her heart, never to be brought up again.</p> <p>When she exited the ward, Lin Nuan’s hand still held onto the apple.</p> <p>The apple had already turned yellow, the top half uneven from Gu Hanyan’s hands while the bottom half was smooth and pretty, peeled by Wen Moshen.</p> <p>While she waited for an elevator at the elevator lobby, Lin Nuan thought of throwing the apple into the trashcan but kept hesitating.</p> <p>“Nuan Nuan…” Gu Hanyan called for Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t turn around but she casually threw the apple into the trashcan as though she no longer had any feelings.</p> <p>Gu Hanyan bit her lips and went up to thank her, saying, “Thank you for not telling Moshen about that matter.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan raised her eyes to look at the number above the elevator door, replying with a cold voice, “You don’t have to thank me, I wasn’t helping you. At that time I too was looking for an excuse to end the long four years of waiting. You… merely gave me a convenient excuse.”</p>",
  "Chapter 90: Have You Called The Police?": "<p>Ding—</p> <p>Once the elevator arrived, Lin Nuan walked in and closed the door—she didn’t glance at Gu Hanyan even once the entire time.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s words made Gu Hanyan think of what Wen Moshen told her that day…</p> <p>“I choose to forgive you because these past four years you have been the only one still waiting for me at where we originally stood. The others and all those other matters have already changed, you’re the only piece of the past I can hold onto.”</p> <p>Actually, the only one who had truly waited for him unchangingly was probably Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Gu Hanyan’s fists clenched tighter. Based on Lin Nuan’s personality, since she didn’t tell Wen Moshen at that moment, she would never mention it to him again in the future, so Gu Hanyan breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>…</p> <p>When Lin Nuan exited the wards building, she saw Bai Xiaonian arguing heatedly with someone in the middle of the crowd.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian’s Audi A4 and a flashing red Porsche 911 had crashed together, the Audi A4’s car door flung far away.</p> <p>“Do you know how expensive it to replace my car’s headlight and to repaint it? You only drive an Audi A4, do you think you can afford to compensate me? Seeing that you’re so pretty, I thought I’d let it go if you just submit to me and be soft, how dare you still talk back to me? I’m telling you… My older brother is a lawyer! You better believe that I’ll make sure you pay for it until you’re broke!”</p> <p>A tall teenager wearing a leather jacket full of rivets was pointing at the slightly shorter Bai Xiaonian with his index finger, shouting at her in an extremely arrogant manner. The three companions beside him were all laughing at her.</p> <p>In her whole life, what Bai Xiaonian hated the most was having someone point their finger at her, so she angrily slapped the teenager’s hand away and spoke fiercely, “I earned the money myself for the Audi A4 I’m driving, unlike you who spends your parents’ money on sports cars, then throw the burden to your brother when you create trouble. How about you reflect on what you are? Our country’s burden, the people’s scourge!”</p> <p>“What what? Scourge?!”</p> <p>Even though the teen didn’t know what the word “scourge” meant, but he felt that as long as it came from Bai Xiaonian’s mouth it couldn’t have been a good word, so he raised his fists in a fighting stance and tried to lunge at Bai Xiaonian, only to be pulled back by his friends.</p> <p>“Tianci! Tianci! Forget it… Why are you bothering so much with a woman?</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian laughed once she heard the teen’s name, saying sarcastically, “Tianci? Say, what kind of sin did your parents commit, you are literally theirTianci <sup>1</sup> scourge!”</p> <p>“Sh*t, you stupid woman!”</p> <p>The teenager called Tianci felt his anger rising again and his friend had to hug him by the waist, barely pulling the boy back as he cried out, “Have you forgotten what your dad said about sending you overseas if you get into any more trouble? Stop making trouble!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan had already walked to the side of both cars and she could tell from the traces of the tires that Bai Xiaonian’s car was parked right in the lot before it was hit so hard that it slanted. Lin Nuan took out her phone from her bag and took photos, her gaze sweeping across the Porsche car and spotting the three Haicheng Middle School uniforms in the backseat.</p> <p>“Hey! What pictures are you taking!” the teen’s partners shouted at Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan ignored them and put away her phone as she walked to Bai Xiaonian’s side and asked, “Have you called the police?”</p> <p>She admitted that she asked Bai Xiaonian the question on purpose because she heard the teen’s partners telling him to avoid getting into trouble…</p> <p>“Not yet…” Bai Xiaonian was so furious her chest was heaving greatly.</p> <p>“Call the police.” Lin Nuan spoke with a neutral voice. “The police will come and settle this. I’ve already taken the photos.”</p> <p>The teen called Tianci’s originally fair face paled even further. He didn’t even have a driver’s license. It would be a small matter if the police came, but if they let his father know that he secretly drove the car out, there was no guarantee that he wouldn’t be sent overseas.</p>",
  "Chapter 91: Unwilling Compromise for the Greater Good": "<p>“Well, sister… This matter is our fault, you can tell us what kind of compensation you want and we will pay it. There’s no need to bring it up to the police. Today, Tianci was just in a hurry to see his mother because she’s been hospitalized, so he drove a bit faster.”</p> <p>The fair-skinned youth’s partner quickly stepped up to explain and give an appeal, but the youth himself turned his head to the side, looking as though he was stubbornly unwilling to surrender to the “evil forces”. Yet he had no choice but to compromise for the greater good.</p> <p>“That’s right, sister! We know we’re wrong, so can the two of you be magnanimous. Just tell us how much money you need and we’ll pay!”</p> <p>“Yes, we shouldn’t make a huge fuss and disturb the policemen uncles for no reason. We can settle this ourselves, right, sisters?”</p> <p>The three companions beside the youth had simply watched the fight earlier on but suddenly they were calling them sisters and being polite and cultured.</p> <p>“Call 4S and ask how much it’ll cost to change the car door and spray the entire side of the car,” Lin Nuan said calmly.</p> <p>After the call, the 4S shop said that Bai Xiaonian’s car’s door required around 8,000 dollars while the paint required about 3,000 dollars.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian had taken out a mortgage to buy the car and she hadn’t even finished repaying the loan so she especially treasured it; her heart ached at how badly it looked after the hit.</p> <p>Hanging up, Bai Xiaonian was afraid that it would be insufficient to cover the repair if she asked for the minimum price, so she purposely raised the number and said, “The total will be 15,000 dollars.”</p> <p>“Are you robbing a bank?!” The youth started shouting again.</p> <p>The accident had been unexpected for Bai Xiaonian who was innocent, so she would definitely be unhappy to pay for anything. She initially thought to keep the teen’s number so she could return the excess to him. After all, she would seem petty if she asked for more if the amount could not cover the repair fees.</p> <p>But the moment the youth spoke, he directly triggered the anger in Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian raised her voice, yelling, “I’ve only asked for the repair fees, I haven’t asked for the compensation for the mental damage! I just opened the door and you drove your car over directly, if I didn’t take my leg back fast enough, it would’ve flown out just like my car door! Do you think the number I’m asking for is high? Then let’s calculate the compensation for the mental damage I’ve received! It’s also 15,000 dollars, so in total it should be 30,000 dollars, not a cent to be missed!”</p> <p>“Let’s just call the police since this fee is too expensive. I can see that these guys are still just children, I’m afraid they won’t be able to take out so much money, so we should still inform their parents.” Lin Nuan spoke clearly without any hurry or worry in her tone</p> <p>Once she said that the youth’s companions clearly panicked.</p> <p>“Tianci… It’s not like you don’t have the money! Just give it to them!”</p> <p>“Forget it, forget it!” his other partners pulled the youth closer and said in a lower voice, “Just take it as you’re spending money on preventing a disaster! It’s more important to find Auntie for her signature!”</p> <p>“That’s right, your dad already disagreed to you taking part in the competition. If this issue really makes it to the police station, even if Auntie signed it, your Dad will still have an excuse to not let you participate in it! Bear with it!”</p> <p>The trio took turns convincing the youth and finally succeeded.</p> <p>Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian waited by the car while the youth went to withdraw cash from the ATM accompanied by his friends, and his friends passed the money to Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Seeing that the youth was avoiding using the bank to transfer the money over, Bai Xiaonian could tell that he was avoiding exchanging information. To avoid future problems, she also chose not to ask him for his number.</p> <p>After the teen and his friends left, Bai Xiaonian called the 4S shop.</p> <p>When the trailer arrived, it was nearly noon and a light rain was starting to fall. Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian shared an umbrella as they watched the doorless A4 being dragged away.</p> <p>There was still time before the program started, so Bai Xiaonian said, “There’s still time, let’s go to Yuanqi to eat some ramen?”</p>",
  "Chapter 92: Make Me Broke From Paying Compensation": "<p>Before Lin Nuan could answer, she saw the shadow of a car from the corner of her eye and quickly pulled Bai Xiaonian who had her back facing the carpark, the Maybach’s auto mirror brushing past Bai Xiaonian’s waist.</p> <p>The documents in Lin Nuan’s hands fell to the ground and were stained with muddy water.</p> <p>With some leftover fear in her heart, Bai Xiaonian took a look at the Maybach as it parked and held onto her chest with one hand, saying, “Should I have checked if today is my lucky day before I left the house? Seems like I’m not getting along well with cars?”</p> <p>“Most people who are coming to the hospital tend to be in a rush…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan passed the umbrella to Bai Xiaonian before she bent down to pick up the information Miss Xia gave her.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian picked up a page of the document that had tire prints on it and said, “I think these papers can’t be used anymore. You should go ask Miss Xia for a new copy!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan took the document and was just about to wipe them with tissues when Bai Xiaonian tapped her elbow, saying, “Nuan Nuan, look… Isn’t that Fu Huai’an? Why is he together with the second-generation rich kid?”</p> <p>She raised her head…</p> <p>Not far away, Fu Huai’an was standing at the top of the stairs of the hospital’s wards building, his figure broad and tall.</p> <p>He wore a dark blue custom-made suit and his jacket remained unbuttoned, exposing the neat white blouse underneath; he had both hands in the pockets of his stiff pants that outlined his long legs, and he looked exceptionally outstanding even in the crowd with his strong aura that exuded maturity.</p> <p>The youth had already removed that spiky leather vest and was wearing a plain white t-shirt with jeans. He stood in front of Fu Huai’an obediently and spoke in a cautious manner with his head raised.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s brows furrowed a little as the phone in his pocket vibrated and he took it out to pick up the call. Just a short while later, he directly looked towards Lin Nuan’s direction.</p> <p>The unexpected meeting of their gazes surprised Lin Nuan and made her nervous so she quickly moved her gaze away.</p> <p>She did not know if it was a coincidence, but recently she kept meeting Fu Huai’an by accident.</p> <p>Remembering that day under the umbrella when Fu Huai’an asked her if she wanted to try dating, Lin Nuan’s palm started growing sticky for some reason.</p> <p>“That second-generation rich kid said his older brother is a lawyer, could he possibly mean Fu Huai’an?” Bai Xiaonian said with a face of surprise that quickly morphed into a sarcastic smile. “If his brother is Fu Huai’an, then as he said, he indeed can make me broke from paying compensation!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan never heard that Fu Huai’an had a younger brother.</p> <p>The phone in the jacket of her coat rang and Lin Nuan switched the documents to her other hand as she took it out, only to see that it was a call from Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>She knew that she could not avoid it, so she forced herself to pick up, simply saying, “Hi…”</p> <p>“You’re already off work, so why are you here at the hospital instead of napping at home?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s thick voice traveled from the phone and Lin Nuan had to admit that the masculine voice of a mature man such as him… Even if he was not doing it on purpose, it could still heat up her ears.</p> <p>“There’s a new program that I have to host so I came over to communicate with the guest. I’m getting ready to go back now…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan subconsciously hid Wen Moshen’s name, instead, replacing it with the word ‘guest’.</p> <p>“Let’s eat together, I’ll send you back later.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s words were full of the decisiveness of a long-time member of the upper-class, not allowing for rejection.</p> <p>Before Lin Nuan could refuse, Fu Huai’an continued, “Walk over here first…”</p> <p>Once she hung up, a voice traveled from behind her.</p> <p>“Let’s go…”</p> <p>Turning back, Lu Jinnan was standing behind them with a cigarette between his fingers.</p> <p>The moment Bai Xiaonian saw Lu Jinnnan she felt that he looked familiar; after some thought, she realized that the man looked especially similar to the a**hole Lu Jinbei, just that Lu Jinnan was taller and larger than Lu Jinbei in size and was more handsome.</p>",
  "Chapter 93: Didn’t Get Injured?": "<p>Seeing Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian, Fu Tianci’s eyes grew wide and he looked shocked.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan walked up the stairs with his hands in his pockets and cigarette in his mouth, saying to Fu Tianci, “You told them that your brother is a lawyer and can sue them until they’re broke?”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan’s words clearly showed that he had heard the words Bai Xiaonian told Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Fu Tianci saw Fu Huai’an’s deep half-lidded gaze looking at him and his ears flushed red as he purposely pulled an impatient face.</p> <p>Seeing that Fu Tianci was not replying, Lu Jinnan removed his cigarette from between his lips with a smile and asked, “This brother you mentioned, could it have been Old Fu?”</p> <p>Fu Tianci glanced at Lu Jinnan before finally speaking with a red face, “Was I supposed to say my nephew is a lawyer and can sue them until they’re broke?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian couldn’t hold back her laughter. If Fu Tianci had said that, she would surely have been amused.</p> <p>Towards outsiders, Fu Tianci had always been proud as he told people that Fu Huai’an was his older brother.</p> <p>In Fu Tianci’s heart, Fu Huai’an was not a competitor for the family inheritance, but an elder who he could rely on and trust in.</p> <p>Fu Tianci glared at Bai Xiaonian and said, “I got into the car accident with these two women, and they cheated me out of 15,000 dollars, Old Fu… Didn’t you want to interfere?”</p> <p>“You have to speak with evidence and logic!” Bai Xiaonian was scared of Fu Huai’an but she had no fear of a child, and her voice raised as she spoke, saying, “For what happened exactly, we can take a look at the security camera and see whether my car was parked peacefully before you knocked it over…”</p> <p>“Old Fu!” Fu Tianci could not win over Bai Xiaonian and turned to Fu Huai’an saying, “I want to sue them both!”</p> <p>Not that she had a bias against second-generation rich kids, but the current Fu Tianci in Lin Nuan’s eyes was a brat pampered by his family and thought that someone would help him no matter what trouble he got into; Lin Nuan did not like these kinds of kids, but she was not too repulsed.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was just lowering his head to light up his cigarette when he heard Fu Tianci’s words. He raised his head slowly and moved the cigarette away from the corner of his lips and said, “Sure, I’ll tell your father…”</p> <p>In other words, Fu Huai’an did not plan on helping Fu Tianci sue Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Fu Tianci suddenly pursed his lips and he looked towards Fu Huai’an with complaints and reprimands in his eyes, but once he met Fu Huai’an’s gaze, he looked down again in a panic and said unclearly, “I’m not going to find him…”</p> <p>Towards Fu Huai’an having such a young uncle, Lin Nuan guessed that he had relatives who were from the older generation, but she felt that Fu Huai’an did not seem like the kind to interfere in his relatives’ minor matters.</p> <p>She had suspicions, but Lin Nuan was not curious.</p> <p>Regarding Fu Huai’an’s family’s relations, Lin Nuan did not know anything and did not wish to know.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an tapped the cigarette ashes away and his deep gaze moved from Fu Tianci onto Lin Nuan’s face, asking, “You didn’t get injured?”</p> <p>Seeing Fu Huai’an ask if Lin Nuan was injured but only lectured him instead of being concerned about him, Fu Tianci looked at Fu Huai’an and was unhappy. Even his gaze towards Lin Nuan was unkind, his face evidently unable to cover up what his heart felt.</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head as she pondered how to reject Fu Huai’an’s lunch invitation.</p> <p>“Mr. Fu, I still have to make a trip back to the station to get my documents. I shouldn’t be having lunch with you…”</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Nuan’s file indeed held a few dirty pages of documents, Fu Huai’an ignored the dirt and his hand reached out to pick up a page that had tire marks on it. Under the mark of the muddy water, Fu Huai’an could make out a few questions, and it was not hard to guess who the program’s guest was from these questions.</p>",
  "Chapter 94: Why Was He Like That?": "<p>Fu Huai’an did not place the document back and instead passed it directly back to Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan reached out to take it, pinching the other end of the paper but it did not budge.</p> <p>Her heartbeat suddenly increased intensely and Lin Nuan did not even dare to raise her head and look at Fu Huai’an, her ears burning hot.</p> <p>They were in public, why was he being like that?</p> <p>Lin Nuan found that either letting go and holding on would be awkward, and she felt heat creeping up into her face.</p> <p>Afraid that others would notice her abnormalities, Lin Nuan tried to act calm and raised her head.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s dark gaze remained fixated on her face and he did not loosen his grip as he said plainly, “You can work after you eat.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt her eyes grow even hotter. Although Fu Huai’an’s words meant well, when she thought of their relationship… Lin Nuan kept feeling that it was intimate and her heart was uneasy.</p> <p>The paper was pulled tight between the two and Lin Nuan did not dare to pull with more force as the paper itself was already soft from being wet. If it tore, even a fool would be able to tell that things were unusual between them.</p> <p>Hearing Fu Huai’an’s words towards Lin Nuan, heat rushed to Fu Tianci’s eyes. Ever since he arrived, Fu Huai’an had never asked him if he had eaten, but he was being so concerned over someone else. Clearly, it was not that Fu Huai’an did not know how to care for others, he simply did not want to care about him, he only ever said to send him to his father!</p> <p>At the thought, Fu Tianci angrily turned around and walked into the hospital.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan’s gaze swept across Fu Tianci’s back and felt unhappy…</p> <p>One call from the old man forced Fu Huai’an, who had just finished a meeting, to come over and handle the matter of his son being cheated, it was not like he did not know how capable his son was. Could he really have been cheated?</p> <p>15,000 dollars could not even buy the t-shirt Fu Tianci was wearing. Anyone else could have handled the issue, yet the old man was really thick-skinned to have made Fu Huai’an come over when he was so busy he couldn’t even eat.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s assistant had already driven the car to the entrance of the hospital and Lu Jinnan informed Fu Huai’an upon noticing.</p> <p>“Let’s go…” Fu Huai’an released the thin paper and meant for Lin Nuan to board the car.</p> <p>Just as she was about to reject, Lin Nuan heard Lu Jinnan say, “Go on, Miss Lin. We can also take the chance to talk about the issue regarding the 15,000 dollars.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan swallowed the words of refusal on her lips.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian was actually still slightly cautious of Fu Huai’an. Once she remembered the special relationship between him and Lin Nuan, Bai Xiaonian thought to let them be alone together and said, “Then I’ll return to the station first!”</p> <p>“The car that got into an accident with Fu Tianci’s, was it not Miss Bai’s car?” Lu Jinnan turned and looked at Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>A series of ellipses went through Bai Xiaonian’s mind.</p> <p>“Seems like Miss Lin must be more careful in choosing friends.” Lu Jinnan spoke in a friendly manner as his clear gaze scanned Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>These words hinted that Bai Xiaonian was not a good friend. It reprimanded Bai Xiaonian for letting Lin Nuan settle the trouble she created.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian did not believe that Fu Huai’an’s friend wasn’t clear about the relationship between Fu Huai’an and Lin Nuan. She felt that Fu Huai’an was the one who was careless in choosing friends since the buddy of his lacked understanding. He didn’t know to leave at that timing, being a third wheel and even dragging her into it and cornering her, what was the point?</p> <p>Seeing that Fu Huai’an’s friend looked similar to the a**hole Lu Jinbei, Bai Xiaonian cursed him internally. A**holes are a**holes indeed, even the way they looked was the same.</p> <p>Fu Tianci angrily walked to the entrance of the elevator and stuck his hands into his pockets, pretending to casually look back at the entrance of the building only to no longer see Fu Huai’an and the rest.</p> <p>Fu Tianci instantly felt hurt, his tears close to falling.</p>",
  "Chapter 95: Caller Was Liang Mulan": "<p>He used the back of his hand to rub his reddening eyes. It was just a meal, even if Fu Huai’an did not say to invite him to eat, there was no way he could starve himself to death?</p> <p>The people who want to eat with him, Fu Tianci, can form a queue from here to Australia!</p> <p>Returning to the ward, he did not see his mother so Fu Tianci asked the nurse, who replied that she had gone for a check-up.</p> <p>He wore his leather jacket and called his friends, who were all bad influences, for lunch as he walked out.</p> <p>On the way to the place they agreed to meet at, Fu Tianci received a call from his mother, saying that Fu Huai’an’s assistant had sent over food and was asking where Fu Tianci was.</p> <p>Fu Tianci’s straight face immediately grew bright and he replied that he would be right back. Once he hung up, he immediately told the driver to turn around and drive back to the hospital while he called up his friends. He was in a good mood, saying that his older brother insisted on him eating before he came out to meet them, and he generously told them to eat without him and put it on his tab.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At the dining table, Fu Huai’an naturally sat beside Lin Nuan, making her uncomfortable.</p> <p>Lin Nuan thought that after meeting Wen Moshen, she would cry a lot, but the peace that came from having a meal with Fu Huai’an after their accidental meeting, and the uneasiness that arose whenever Fu Huai’an would occasionally place some food in her bowl – her emotions did not waver because of Wen Moshen.</p> <p>Having someone apart from her parents from the Lin family and Lin Chen placing food in her bowl made Lin Nuan uneasy, because Fu Huai’an was using his own chopsticks instead of the shared public chopsticks.</p> <p>It was not that Lin Nuan was extremely pure, but even though she had kissed Fu Huai’an multiple times and they’d even had s*x, but eating the food that he placed in her bowl with his own chopsticks kept giving Lin Nuan the feeling that they were indirectly kissing.</p> <p>Remembering that when she used to eat together with Gu Hanyan and Wen Moshen, Wen Moshen would always put food into Gu Hanyan’s bowl, Lin Nuan thought… Is that the dating thing that Fu Huai’an was talking about?</p> <p>Lin Nuan was distracted as she took out a mouthful of food out of her bowl, only for a sour taste so strong that her brows immediately drew tightly together.</p> <p>“Do you know how to raise a cat?</p> <p>At the dining table, Fu Huai’an asked a question he knew the answer to.</p> <p>At the mention of cats, Lin Nuan’s fingers tightened around her chopsticks as she thought of Mushroom who she had taken care of for so many years.</p> <p>Her reply remained stuck in her throat and Lin Nuan opened her mouth, unable to make any sound so she simply nodded and forcefully swallowed the vegetables in her mouth, her sour emotions filling up her whole chest.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian knew that Fu Huai’an’s words undoubtedly poured salt onto Lin Nuan’s wound.</p> <p>Before Fu Huai’an could speak again, the phone resting beside his lighter starting ringing.</p> <p>It was probably company matters so Fu Huai’an took his cigarettes and lighter before he exited the restaurant to pick up the call.</p> <p>Currently, the rain outside was really heavy.</p> <p>Lin Nuan placed her chopsticks down and picked up her juice to take a sip, the chilled juice sliding down her throat unable to mask the change in her emotions; though once the phone in her bag rang, Lu Jinnan raised his eyebrow and smirked, saying, “Even your phones’ ringtones are the same. Seems like Miss Lin and Old Fu have the same interests.”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan’s words hid a hidden meaning behind them, easily giving the wrong impression that he was saying that Lin Nuan was the exact type that Fu Huai’an liked.</p> <p>Lin Nuan furrowed her brows – she did not like the meaning behind Lu Jinnan’s words.</p> <p>Picking up her phone, Lin Nuan also went out to pick up a call. The caller was Liang Mulan.</p> <p>“Mom..”</p> <p>When she exited the restaurant, she saw that Fu Huai’an stood beside the rubbish bin at the entrance as he coldly discussed work matters on the phone with a cigarette in hand, white smoke rising from between his lips as they parted and closed. His clear facial features held mild anger to them as he tapped the cigarette ashes into the rubbish bin and his deep gaze looked towards Lin Nuan.</p>",
  "Chapter 96: Leave It for After Dinner": "<p>Lin Nuan averted her eyes from Fu Huai’an and pretended to converse with Liang Mulan calmly. She looked down and picked up the phone at the other end of the restaurant.</p> <p>Her back was facing Fu Huai’an’s direction as she hurriedly tucked her loose strands of hair behind her ear.</p> <p>“Yes, I’m already eating… with my friend.”</p> <p>Liang Mulan told Lin Nuan to eat less spicy food on the other end of the line since her stomach wasn’t good. Her words were filled with motherly care.</p> <p>“I know, I barely even touch spicy foods now…”</p> <p>She wanted to say she was going to visit Liang Mulan the next day, but as soon as she thought of Lin Ran, she gulped back her words.</p> <p>But then Liang Mulan apologized for Lin Ran and said she was ready to go back home to recover, so Lin Nuan flimsily said, “Then I’ll visit you in my free time!?”</p> <p>Even if it was flimsy, Liang Mulan was still very happy to hear it. She persuaded Lin Nuan to call before coming back so that she could prepare her favorite dishes in the kitchen.</p> <p>As she hung up and turned around, Lin Nuan saw that Fu Huai’an had already hung up the phone – she wasn’t sure if he was smoking or waiting for her.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hands clenched as she held her phone. She said, “I’ll be going inside first…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an put out his cigar and walked towards Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s tall, imposing figure approached her, causing the muscles over her whole body to tense up. She unconsciously took a step back, but then she felt the gesture made her look as if she was super scared of him. Hence she clutched her fists and stood her ground. The sound of rain flooded her ears.</p> <p>She was enveloped by Fu Huai’an’s shadow, her nose filled with the faint scent of cigars on Fu Huai’an’s body and the healthy aroma of a man. At eye level, she could see his open shirt collar and his Adam’s apple.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an kept his hands in his pockets and his gaze fixed on Lin Nuan.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, the relationship mentioned last time… do you want to try it?” Fu Huai’an said in his low, intoxicating voice.</p> <p>As he said it, his attractive Adam’s apple bobbed up and down. Lin Nuan caught sight of it, blushed and looked down… yet her gaze unconsciously fell on Fu Huai’an’s lower area.</p> <p>His hands were in his pockets which caused that area to look tighter than usual…</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s averting eyes were full of panic as her heart began to beat faster.</p> <p>“Which word did I say to make you blush like this?” Fu Huai’an asked in a low voice.</p> <p>That made Lin Nuan feel ashamed and angry. She wanted to look straight up into his eyes, yet she met with his playful, smiling gaze and averted her eyes like a coward again, clutching her phone in her hands.</p> <p>“I’ve never been in a relationship before, so I’m not sure what you’re referring to by this relationship, Mr. Fu,” Lin Nuan said in a cold tone, “Is it just the usual, eating together, going on dates together, sleeping together?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt that no matter how she answered it would be wrong. If she agreed to try… then they would collect the certificate after being in the relationship long enough. If she disagreed then they would have to collect it right then, leaving her with no choice whatsoever.</p> <p>With Wen Moshen being back, she could be a bit reckless. After all, in Lin Nuan’s heart… she did feel cheated by Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Before Gu Hanyan’s photos were revealed, Lin Nuan didn’t think that way. But after Fu Huai’an told Gu Hanyan to wait for Wen Moshen for an eternity that morning, Gu Hanyan’s photos with other men were leaked.</p> <p>It implied Fu Huai’an was well aware of what kind of person Gu Hanyan was like long ago, and had no intention of making Gu Hanyan his woman. She sent herself to his doorstep like an idiot!</p> <p>She guessed that Fu Huai’an’s mentality at that time was that Lin Nuan sent herself there and might as well enjoy the benefits.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was pleased by how Lin Nuan said she “wasn’t in a relationship”. He sensed Lin Nuan was agitated and smiled even more, “Finish your meal first, we’ll leave this for after dinner…”</p>",
  "Chapter 97: Don’t Throw a Tantrum Like a Kid": "<p>The restaurant was a couple dozen meters away from Ocean City radio station. After lunch, Bai Xiaonian coincidentally met with her colleagues and left with them.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan got a call from the police station halfway through, saying that his inadequate brother, Li Jinbei, was caught for committing fraud from the past.</p> <p>Lu Jinnan drove the car away. Fu Huai’an let the company send over another car. As they sent the keys over, they noticed Lin Nuan by his side and left with a knowing look.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was driving and Lin Nuan didn’t ask where he was going.</p> <p>She initially thought Fu Huai’an was going to send her home, yet he turned on the left turning signal at the traffic lights.</p> <p>“You’re supposed to turn right…” Lin Nuan blurted out.</p> <p>As he made a turn, Fu Huai’an’s phone began to vibrate. He kept one hand on the steering wheel and glanced towards Lin Nuan. Without paying attention to the phone in the storage drawer, he said, “We’re going to my place.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan suddenly felt sirens in her heart go off, “What are we going to your place for?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an detected Lin Nuan’s tone and parked the car by the road.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, we need to talk…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan had the same thoughts.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s phone was still vibrating. He unbuckled his seatbelt and retrieved his phone from the storage drawer and turned it off. As he put it back, he took out a cigar box and a lighter. He whipped a cigar out and lit it up. Taking a deep puff, he rolled down the car window slightly.</p> <p>The windshield wipers in front were vigorously moving back and forth. Fu Huai’an turned them off with his cigar-wielding hand and they stopped. The pouring rain immediately blurred away the scenery in front of them.</p> <p>He was the one who said they needed to talk, yet he was also the one who didn’t say anything to start the conversation.</p> <p>Lin Nuan watched Fu Huai’an bite on his cigar and unhurriedly take off his suit jacket. He kept one hand on the steering wheel and turned slightly to put his suit on the back seat…</p> <p>She clutched her seatbelt in front of her chest tightly and moved her body towards the car door near her seat, doing everything in her strength to avoid Fu Huai’an’s movements of approaching her as he put down his jacket.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked at her through half-opened eyes, his deep gaze making her heart skip a beat.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had little resistance against Fu Huai’an’s gaze. She just sheepishly dodged away, and he was staring at her with his dark eyes—the strong reasoning she just prepared in her head suddenly began to fade away.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was smiling with his eyes. He removed the cigar from the corner of his mouth and said, “Just now at the rest door, you had something to say…”</p> <p>As Fu Huai’an mentioned this, Lin Nuan collected her emotions. She was visibly less angry compared to that at the restaurant entrance, “Mr. Fu, I want to know, even if I didn’t go find you that day, you wouldn’t have married Gu Hanyan, right?”</p> <p>Although she wasn’t sure whether Fu Huai’an’s type of men were clean-freaks, at least they wouldn’t prefer to go through women indiscriminately.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an observed Lin Nuan and said without hiding anything, “I didn’t have such plans…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s palms were sweaty as they clutched the seat belt. She said with bitterness in her heart, “Why didn’t you say so that night?”</p> <p>She recalled Fu Huai’an saying she was “clean” before he wanted to make love – she felt that deep inside she was disgusted by him even more. She deduced that all men must be the same, why would they not touch a clean girl who sends herself to them? Even if Fu Huai’an was more refined and gentleman-like, he couldn’t escape this.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt stifled in her heart and her eyes grew wet. She stared straight ahead without saying anything.</p> <p>“That evening when we made love, did I not make you feel pleasure?” Fu Huai’an asked seriously, his defined features radiating ample male charm.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt thoroughly abashed by Fu Huai’an’s words. She turned and stared at him with reddened eyes.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, we’re both adults. We can be honest and blunt when we talk, don’t throw a tantrum like a kid.”</p>",
  "Chapter 98: A Sudden Conclusion": "<p>“Compared to you, I’m just a kid!?” Lin Nuan said with a tone of sarcasm.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an fell silent for a moment and asked, “So you think I’m old?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t respond.</p> <p>“Age is indeed a shortcoming I can’t change. Is there anything else you’re unsatisfied with?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an said unhurriedly with a very patient and serious look. That was in high contrast with Lin Nuan’s abashed and furious expression.</p> <p>“Mr. Fu, you cheated me that night! You should have told me you had no intention of making Gu Hanyan your wife!”</p> <p>“Did I tell you I was going to make Gu Hanyan my wife?” Fu Huai’an asked back.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was at a loss for words. That night Fu Huai’an said… he didn’t care who that woman was!</p> <p>Her chest grew more and more stuffy and she said without thinking, “Then since you’re not planning to marry Gu Hanyan, then if I don’t marry you it doesn’t count as not keeping my word, right?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an nodded, “Naturally…”</p> <p>“Very well!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan unbuckled her seatbelt and pushed open the car door with reddened eyes.</p> <p>“Click—”</p> <p>As Lin Nuan pushed the door, it unexpectedly got locked all of a sudden. She forcefully yanked on the turning handle but the door wouldn’t budge… she turned around and glared at Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, please talk properly. Throwing a tantrum and leaving is something people do at Tuan Tuan’s age…” Fu Huai’an voice was calm without any detectable irritation.</p> <p>“If I don’t leave after the conversation, is it suitable for a single man and woman to be in a car together?” Lin Nuan asked.</p> <p>“Talking is something between two people. If you leave right after you finish speaking without giving the other person any room to say anything, this is called letting out your own feelings rather than a conversation…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan really disliked Fu Huai’an’s voice. He was so calm and composed, despite sounding so charming and enticing. It really made her look like an ill-bred little girl throwing a temper by contrast.</p> <p>“Then what are you trying to say? Do you want me to say I enjoyed making love with you, so we should go do it again at your place?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t feel relieved after saying that—she only felt more stuffy inside. She decided to go all out and yanked hard on the door handle again.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked at the woman sitting next to him who struggled to open the door and failed and was just sitting there pissed. He rolled down the car window and flicked his cigar outside.</p> <p>“Are you angry because you felt pleasure when you did it with me?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an suddenly came to that conclusion after looking at Lin Nuan for a while.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s eyes were too piercing that they read Lin Nuan’s heart immediately. It made Lin Nuan even more uneasy behind her shame. She felt transparent, like a piece of white paper before the all-knowing Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s whole face read denial.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an said slowly, “That evening, your screams couldn’t hide your immense pleasure.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s face grew a messy red again.</p> <p>She felt angry and embarrassed yet again. She said under her breath, “You men… do you only think about that in your heads no matter whether it’s day or night?”</p> <p>“Depends on who it is…” Fu Huai’an took a puff of his cigar and suppressed his temper. He seemed to seriously be answering Lin Nuan’s question, “You don’t understand men, so don’t jump to conclusions so easily.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan couldn’t say anything thanks to Fu Huai’an. She indeed was not a man. But Lin Nuan felt the conclusion she made about Fu Huai’an didn’t make him feel wronged!</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, it’s not like I would be with any woman, I actually like you a lot…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an lit up another cigar after finishing one. He opened the window a bit wider and let the cool air swirl into the car. The left side of his shirt was full of moisture at the shoulder area.</p>",
  "Chapter 99: The Temperature Suddenly Rose": "<p>“Mr. Fu, do you know what it means to like someone? Is liking someone when you keep casually dropping words like ‘making love’?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s hand that was playing with the lighter suddenly paused. He threw the lighter on the drawer and let out a haze of smoke. In the mist, his deep unfathomable eyes seemed to have a burning fire behind them.</p> <p>He closed the car window and the sound of the rain was blocked outside.</p> <p>Before Lin Nuan could look towards Fu Huai’an’s direction, she felt her seat suddenly lean backward. Fu Huai’an’s tall figure hovered over her across the control panel.</p> <p>She opened her eyes wide to stare at the man who suddenly leaned over her and was still left in shock before she could react.</p> <p>All she could see was that man’s deeply defined features; his thin lips and arched nose; his unfathomable eyes with a depth deeper than the ocean. There even seemed to be a touching depth of affection behind them.</p> <p>A man with looks and charm could easily win over a woman’s heart. Since Lin Nuan was a woman too… she couldn’t help but be bewitched by him.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s cigar-wielding hand was pressed up against the car window while the other held Lin Nuan’s chin. His thumb was caressing her bright red lips. He said in an intentionally lowered and raspy voice as if he was concealing something, “Lin Nuan, when the words making love come out of this petite mouth, isn’t it flirtatious…”</p> <p>As he spoke, his attractive Adam’s apple was bobbing gently, and combined with his magnetic deep voice, Lin Nuan almost couldn’t resist it.</p> <p>“Let go of me!”</p> <p>She bit on her lips and struggled embarrassedly. She kept one arm against Fu Huai’an’s chest and the other holding his wrist as he tried to grasp her chin. The shuffling movements in the car appeared to be highly flirtatious.</p> <p>In the confined space, the temperature suddenly rose and became exceptionally heated.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an bit the cigar and used one hand to pin down the struggling Lin Nuan, putting her hands above her head. He then removed the cigar from the corner of his mouth and put it out.</p> <p>The huge difference between a man and a woman’s physical strength made it impossible for her to break free from his grasp.</p> <p>Lin Nuan let out a short shriek, but the vulgarities she was about to yell were quickly swallowed into Fu Huai’an’s mouth.</p> <p>Goosebumps spread across her whole body.</p> <p>There were people walking here and there in the middle of the day on the streets. Lin Nuan felt so nervous her heart was going to explode as she kept kicking her feet.</p> <p>A large hand pressed against Lin Nuan’s leg and startled her. Her whole body was tensed up and she didn’t dare move. All she could do was passively endure Fu Huai’an’s intoxicating and passionate kiss.</p> <p>The male taste filled up her whole mouth.</p> <p>Shame, anger, and fear morphed into one. Lin Nuan felt tears forming in her eyes.</p> <p>It wasn’t until Lin Nuan’s tongue felt sour and soft that Fu Huai’an let go of her lips.</p> <p>They were only ten centimeters apart. The heat from Fu Huai’an’s breath pressed up against Lin Nuan’s face. His large hands were caressing her soft body. With his deep gaze and voice, he was even more alluring than the host in the radio show…</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, I’m no longer a teenage kid. I’m long past that age when I can hold my crush’s hand and feel content. You’re right, I do like you, the kind that makes me want to do it with you anytime. This is what happens when a man likes a girl, contrary to when a boy likes a girl. In a man’s world, the most direct form of liking a girl is the moment you see her and you imagine the way she looks like naked. Your whole body yearns for her body and you want to make love to her all day and all night. To show your affection for her. This is what a man’s like is…”</p> <p>Considering that Lin Nuan was a reserved girl, Fu Huai’an changed the words “sleep together” into “make love”.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s deep gaze wasn’t as unfathomable as before as he talked bluntly.</p>",
  "Chapter 100: The Pride in His Bones Forbade Him From Doing So": "<p>The usual formal and composed Fu Huai’an was saying such raw things unabashedly and with a burning gaze. Lin Nuan could almost feel her face burning.</p> <p>Her heart was almost at her throat ready to leap out of her mouth. Surprisingly… as she listened to these words she would usually consider degenerate, she was so ashamed that her whole body was hot, but she didn’t feel any disgust.</p> <p>“Pervert!” Lin Nuan scorned.</p> <p>“If you call me a pervert, then what are you? Your body clearly enjoys how I treat you, so why is your mouth betraying you?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an said as he caressed Lin Nuan’s body with his large hands, his slender long fingers full of strength, his deep attractive voice more alluring than ever, like an intoxicating siren.</p> <p>Shame filled Lin Nuan’s heart as her body tensed up and she looked troubled… Her whole body was burning hot. She tried to squirm away and escape, yet her senses became more and more alert, especially when his cold watch chain contacted her skin – she couldn’t help but shake and nearly became soft as a pillow on her seat.</p> <p>She abashedly lowered her voice and tried to pull back her hand from Fu Huai’an’s. “Stop it!”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an cooperatively stopped. He observed Lin Nuan’s blushing face and asked, “Then Lin Nuan, what is your answer? Do you want to give it a try?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s topic changed too fast. Lin Nuan suddenly felt her brain get stuck. “Try what?”</p> <p>“Being in a relationship with a man.”</p> <p>By her ears, Lin Nuan heard a male voice so sexy that it could make one’s body tremble.</p> <p>Being in a relationship by itself sounded delicate and lovely. But once he added in ‘with a man’, it had an extra taste of desire in it, especially when Fu Huai’an’s area was pressed up against her. Lin Nuan’s breathing was messed up.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was clear of what he meant…</p> <p>Being in a relationship with a boy was just holding hands in a platonic fashion; but being in a relationship with a man, especially one like Fu Huai’an, meant that they would passionately be rolling into bed at any minute.</p> <p>He said that when he saw the girl he liked he would imagine her taking off her clothes, naked.</p> <p>Lin Nuan found it difficult to imagine what other activities they could do besides making love if every time she met Fu Huai’an, all he could think about was her being naked.</p> <p>Not knowing whether she had already become thick-faced thanks to Fu Huai’an’s provocation, she already felt uneasy as she thought of it.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s character under his formal suit attire wasn’t as grounded and righteous as the persona he’d constantly put up. That adequately showed Lin Nuan what a bastard in a suit was.</p> <p>She turned her head and answered half-heartedly, “I don’t know…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s fair neck and her red ears were exposed right before Fu Huai’an’s eyes. His lips were dry and his gaze was burning.</p> <p>How could he be content with just a kiss? He calmed himself down and said plainly, “Lin Nuan, answer my question. Stop escaping it.”</p> <p>“Let go of me first…” Lin Nuan forced herself to calm down.</p> <p>Perhaps he wanted to hear what Lin Nuan had to say; he let go of her in the end.</p> <p>Their clothes were both wrinkled, especially Lin Nuan’s…</p> <p>She stood up straight and tidied up her clothes as well as her emotions.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was afraid of Fu Huai’an. Speaking from their sexes, he was a man and she was a woman, hence there was a considerable difference in their strength. If he was going to use force, Lin Nuan didn’t have the confidence that she could escape.</p> <p>But no matter how afraid she was of him, she still had to make clear her point.</p> <p>Despite his words and actions to Lin Nuan not being gentlemanly enough, she still believed successful men like Fu Huai’an would never make a woman settle for doing it with him if they were unwilling. The pride in his bones would forbid him from doing so.</p>",
  "Chapter 101: No Different From What Those People Did": "<p>They just couldn’t expand the subject—their relationship was still stuck at flirting.</p> <p>“Mr. Fu, you said you like me and I believe that, just like how you said we were both grown men and women. As long as we’re straight, it would be normal to appreciate the opposite sex. In the scenario that we haven’t known each other for long and barely know that much about each other, you let me go collect the marriage certificate with you. Despite not being able to collect it in the end, I still think you treat relationships way too casually and flimsily!”</p> <p>“Before we met because of Tuan Tuan, we were basically two strangers! You’re thirty years old this year and no longer a fresh young man in his twenties, you can feel impulses when you see the girl you like and also dare to marry her under impulse? But you’re a successful career man and you should be much more mature and grounded than you look right now, deep inside.”</p> <p>“The best result from a relationship is to get married. I even think that you’re well aware that every girl who doesn’t want to be treated flimsily would want to get married to her boyfriend from their relationship, hence you’re using this as bait to lure me in.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an listened to Lin Nuan seriously. He grabbed the cigar box and lit up a cigar. He nodded to signify Lin Nuan to continue.</p> <p>She thought for a moment and continued, “Mr. Fu you also said you’re just in need of a woman and Tuan Tuan was in need of a mother. You didn’t mind who this woman was, so today this woman could be Lin Nuan, tomorrow Li Nuan… and then Wang Nuan? I’m not saying you’re a player, I just feel that you have no idea what it means to truly like somebody? If you like someone, at least show them respect! Perhaps the first time since I was the initiator, Mr. Fu thought the intimate kissing afterward was naturally expected and normal, and so you didn’t need to seek consent from the victim.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan once thought that if Fu Huai’an was willing to give her enough respect, she was willing to spend the rest of her life together with him.</p> <p>“Yes, I have feelings after every single kiss. A mature woman’s body would naturally have a reaction when contacting a man’s body, I don’t think there’s anything strange about that. If I have feelings from other people’s kisses, then does that mean I can sleep with them?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan said that calmly and cooly, without the edginess from her unstable emotions just before.</p> <p>“I can’t compare with you in terms of eloquence. Since you were a lawyer you can always leave me speechless with everything you say. Perhaps your views and reasoning on the relationship between men and women are all correct. It’s just that I haven’t been in society long enough to understand them. If that’s the case, then it only points to one problem; that we don’t belong in the same world together.”</p> <p>After saying that, Lin Nuan recalled what Fu Huai’an said that made her flush and her heart beat faster. She paused, and continued, “In my eyes, only those investors who try to take advantage of people would picture people taking off their clothes in their heads when they see them. They would also say they like a woman, but they only like her young, fresh body. After the pleasure, they pull up their pants and can act like nothing ever happened, as if their affection was only limited to on the bed…”</p> <p>“The kind of men you mentioned had a huge distance between their rational thinking and instincts. Only after they attended to their instinct can logic enter their heads.”</p> <p>When Fu Huai’an said that, he looked superior and smug as if he had long transcended his natural instincts and can control it as he wished. Yet Lin Nuan was clear that that was indeed the case.</p> <p>“But for me personally, what you do and what you just said, was no different from what those people did and said.”</p>",
  "Chapter 102: I Can Also Cooperate": "<p>They all just want to get people to climb into their beds.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t say that out loud, of course.</p> <p>She knew her understanding of society was not as deep as Fu Huai’an’s, and her eloquence was not as good as Fu Huai’an’s. Hence, she decided to speak honestly from her mind.</p> <p>“Lin Nuan, no matter how much more logical and flawless your speech is, it can’t hide the fact that you have feelings for my kiss and for me. You have to admit we have a lot of chemistry in bed. Suppose someone else treats you like this, do you think you’ll let him get away with it based on your highly-dignified personality?”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an rarely talked so much like that day. He felt it was both ridiculous and infuriating to argue with a little girl on what it meant to like somebody.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an admitted that the reason he could speak so bluntly with Lin Nuan on the matter was because they had done it.</p> <p>The method of a gradual build-up wasn’t effective for a girl like Lin Nuan who already had someone in her heart and heated up slowly. Fu Huai’an was well aware of that.</p> <p>Lin Nuan pursed her lips without saying anything. She once imagined slapping Fu Huai’an once if he leaned in too close to invade her space. But when the moment actually came that they were pressed up closely against each other and sharing an intimate space, Lin Nuan couldn’t resist it at all; she could only lie softly and let him give and take as he wished.</p> <p>It’s not like Lin Nuan didn’t think about Fu Huai’an’s words before…</p> <p>Lin Nuan was sure that every time they kissed, if Fu Huai’an was a bit more adamant instead of not forcing her to do it when she was unwilling… she would definitely go along with it and give him all of herself.</p> <p>She averted her eyes sheepishly and comforted herself inside that perhaps because her first experience in that area was thanks to Fu Huai’an, she wasn’t that resistant to Fu Huai’an like the way nestling birds relied on their caretakers.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s other phone vibrated in his pocket.</p> <p>It was Fu Huai’an’s private number. He picked it up, glanced at the caller ID and answered it. “Yes…”</p> <p>The car was very quiet inside. Lin Nuan could vaguely hear a female voice at the other end of the line, who was speaking with a soft and playful tone.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s hands tensed up on her knees. She looked away and pretended to look outside the car window nonchalantly. The rain already grew weaker and was ready to stop at any time.</p> <p>As he hung up, Fu Huai’an kept his cigar-wielding hand on the steering wheel. He stared at the beautiful curves of Lin Nuan’s neck and said to her, “You can go back home and think about what I said carefully. If you’re willing to be with me, you can raise any demands and I’ll try to cooperate. I have to go on a business trip later and won’t be back until three days later. By then you should be able to give me an answer, ok?”</p> <p>“Including not sleeping with you?”</p> <p>“If you like other areas, I can also cooperate.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an intentionally twisted Lin Nuan’s words. His light grin and magnetic voice were so flirtatious it made Lin Nuan sit on her toes. His calm and deep gaze seemed to see right through her.</p> <p>Thinking that his mind must be filled with a mess of impure thoughts, Lin Nuan’s face grew so hot it could steam an egg. She stared at Fu Huai’an and said, “Despicable!”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an stopped playing with Lin Nuan and started the engine. He flicked on the turning signal and said, “Lin Nuan, for some things, they happen naturally once the feelings are strong enough. I said it before that I don’t force women if they’re reluctant.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s car parked in front of Lin Nuan’s apartment. Without even saying goodbye, Lin Nuan kept her documents in her hands and slammed the car door shut, proceeding upstairs without looking back.</p> <p>Lin Nuan walked into the elevator and as soon as she pressed her floor number, she realized she only brought her documents. Her bag was still in his car.</p> <p>Despite her considerable reluctance, Lin Nuan still walked out of the elevator and came downstairs via another shaft.</p> <p>Near the stairs of the apartment, Fu Huai’an’s black car was still parked in place and hadn’t left yet.</p>",
  "Chapter 103: Go Back and Think About It": "<p>Lin Nuan walked over and felt awkward inside. She just slammed the car door with such force and she has to go back to Fu Huai’an with her tail between her legs. Thinking about it made her embarrassed…</p> <p>In the drizzling rain, Lin Nuan reluctantly knocked on the car window.</p> <p>The driver’s door opened and Fu Huai’an walked out with the cigar in his mouth. His slender long fingers clutched Lin Nuan’s bag as he shut the car door. Walking over unhurriedly with his long legs, his mature and refined aura made Lin Nuan wonder if what he just said in the car that made her flush was just an illusion.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an didn’t trouble her and passed her the bag.</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked at his arched nose and thin lips. She reached out to take the bag and said with good manners, “Thank you…”</p> <p>Surprisingly Fu Huai’an didn’t let go. Lin Nuan furrowed her eyebrows and recalled how he was holding her documents in the hospital that afternoon.</p> <p>She wanted to yank back her purse and as soon she tried to do so… she felt pulled forward a step by Fu Huai’an. Her heart began to race.</p> <p>“Think about what I said when you go back home, okay?”</p> <p>The distance between them was a bit compromising but still safe. Fu Huai’an didn’t do anything out of line, but his gaze was so deep it made her heart beat faster.</p> <p>Lin Nuan suppressed her bedazzled heart and nodded nonchalantly, “Okay…”</p> <p>As he got his answer, Fu Huai’an let go of the bag. He kept one hand in his pocket and flicked his cigar and he said, “Go back upstairs then.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s messed up feelings by Fu Huai’an only began to cool down when the elevator reached her floor.</p> <p>As she walked out the elevator… she spotted someone at the door of her house. She was wearing a baseball cap, dark glasses, and a mouth mask, a trendy flower embroidered denim jacket, black pants, with white sports shoes. She was sitting on her luggage case and looking down blankly.</p> <p>As she heard the door of the elevator open, the girl looked towards Lin Nuan’s direction and stood up, her sweet, soft voice with a hint of raspiness inside, “Nuan…”</p> <p>The person standing at Lin Nuan’s door was her and Bai Xiaonian’s very close friend Song Yao from university.</p> <p>At that time when the three of them graduated from university, they all had great anticipation for the future. Yet Song Yao couldn’t handle the difficulties since entering the Radio Station and was unwilling to follow the unspoken rules. As she also did not know how to control her shine on occasions, she was forced to leave the radio station.</p> <p>Yet nobody expected how things took a drastic turn. Song Yao surprisingly got into the entertainment business and rose to fame from one fantasy fighting show.</p> <p>Today, Song Yao was one of the renowned young actresses in mainland China and received continuous roles and advertisement gigs.</p> <p>Noticing the heaviness in Song Yao’s voice, Lin Nuan opened the door and let her in first.</p> <p>Her face was still a bit hot. She put her purse and documents on the shoe rack and helped Song Yao bring in her luggage.</p> <p>“Weren’t you filming overseas…”</p> <p>Before Lin Nuan could finish her sentence, she was shocked to see that Song Yao had bruises on her nose and face after she removed her hat and glasses.</p> <p>…</p> <p>When Bai Xiaonian rushed over after the show, Song Yao had already changed into Lin Nuan’s comfortable home clothes and pulled her hair up into a neat bun. She was handling a fresh fish in the kitchen with her sleeves rolled up and didn’t say a single word nor shed one tear.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian came in such a hurry that her shoes were soaked.</p> <p>She kept one hand on the shoe rack and glanced towards the kitchen as she leaned over and changed out of her high-heels. She lowered her voice and asked Lin Nuan, “What’s going on? Did she break up with that Su guy?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan shook her head. Bai Xiaonian also didn’t think it was likely since they met Song Yao’s boyfriend before. He didn’t have the best etiquette but he most certainly wasn’t the type to hit a woman.</p>",
  "Chapter 104: Can I Get Drunk Once at Your Place?": "<p>Song Yao’s luggage was placed right on the countertop of the kitchen. Inside the case was not clothes and makeup but vegetables and fruits…</p> <p>Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian didn’t say a word.</p> <p>When the food was ready, they brought the dishes to the table.</p> <p>Song Yao looked down and took out a bottle of red wine from the luggage case and opened it. She lit up a cigar and smoked it stiffly as she let out a few coughs.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian snatched the half-finished cigar from Song Yao’s hands and put it out in the sink. “Don’t smoke if you don’t know how to!”</p> <p>At the table, Song Yao poured herself a glass of wine. Her eyes were red as she pulled out another cigar and placed it in the corner of her mouth. Her movements as she held the lighter and attempted to light the cigar were shaky and stiff.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian didn’t stop her.</p> <p>Song Yao put the lighter on the table and said, “I don’t dare to get drunk anywhere else, Nuan… is it alright if I get drunk at your place today just this one time?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan nodded.</p> <p>As she exhaled smoke, Song Yao’s tears streamed down her cheeks. Her expression was plain and she said half-heartedly, “I was actually thinking for a while about how to tell you this, but no matter how I phrase it, it’s going to sound weird, so I might as well tell you honestly. I slept with one of my investors who has been wanting to do it for a while.”</p> <p>Song Yao’s words dropped like thunder. Bai Xiaonian was left in shock. She examined the wounds on Song Yao’s face and body and asked, “Where did these bruises come from? Did the investor have any weird kinks or did Su Huan do this to you?”</p> <p>Song Yao shook her head and continued in an extremely pale voice.</p> <p>“I broke up with Su Huan three months ago.” Song Yao looked down and took a whiff of her cigar, “I feel sorry for Su Huan, I thought I could be devoted to him, yet the truth is I just haven’t met a more attractive man yet.”</p> <p>These years Song Yao and Su Huan were in a platonic relationship. Despite being in the filthy entertainment circle, Song Yao tried to preserve her naiveness and wanted to save her first time for her romantic wedding night.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian had previously made fun of Song Yao for being naive. She used the jerk Lu Jinbei as an example to tell Song Yao: if she was settled on marrying Su Huan, then she should make sure Su Huan was well fed. Otherwise, he would go hunting outside. Who knew only half a year later, something like that would happen.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian cut Song Yao off. “Does this man have a wife?”</p> <p>“Something like that, he has a fiance.” Song Yao knew Bai Xiaonian hated mistresses the most. Her reddened eyes looked towards Bai Xiaonian whose expression just changed. “I had no idea before I slept with him, I always thought he was single. But even so… even if I knew he had a fiance, I would have still done the same thing!”</p> <p>After a short pause, Song Yao looked down and continued, “If I had just graduated from school that year… naive like a sheet of white paper in my early twenties in the best years of my life, I would definitely still fight passionately and fearlessly. I would have sworn to show those people who climbed to power using those unspoken rules, that I didn’t use them myself yet I could still reach a height that they could only wish to see!”</p> <p>Song Yao raised her glass and finished her drink in one sip. She put down her drink and continued…</p> <p>“These years, I kept watching those artists who rose to fame and stole my roles playing by these unglamorous rules. Even if my acting skills were better, I still couldn’t compete with people who had support behind them. They received so many awards that their hands were getting tired from holding them, yet now even if I was just mentioned for an award I would only be a secondary role! I’m twenty-seven this year and almost turning twenty-eight. I look into the mirror and see wrinkles at the side of my eyes. My face is no longer filled with collagen, and even if I spend more money to buy more expensive skincare products it wouldn’t help preserve my looks when I was in my early twenties. After leaving PS I don’t have the kind of perfect and flawless skin my fans would admire! And I increasingly feel how short the careers of female artists are. I already know I can’t take much hardship anymore!”</p>",
  "Chapter 105: There Was Just Not Enough Temptation": "<p>“That man, he let me get the exact role I wanted and not have to worry that someone else would take it. He even let me choose my script and director as I wished… even my acting partners as well! He could let me be treated fairly in all kinds of film award shows instead of merely playing the background for other people. I thought about it. Maybe when he gets tired of playing with me he would dump me without hesitation, but the days I spend with him now make me feel like my life is so glamorous without a hint of loneliness!”</p> <p>“We did everything a couple would do; he pampers me like a little girl. Within three short days, he let me forget my age and even the fact that Su Huan existed. He let me forget the despair and agony when I first broke up with Su Huan and got together with him. I’m clear that we don’t have a future together, but I feel that even if we break up one day, I already got what I wanted. What do you think… isn’t this kind of mentality messed up? Isn’t it very filthy?”</p> <p>Song Yao laughed weakly and asked Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian didn’t say anything.</p> <p>Lin Nuan also didn’t say anything…</p> <p>If it were Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian from three or four years ago, maybe they would nod and try hard to convince Song Yao to return on the right path.</p> <p>But at that age, nobody was a clean sheet of white paper anymore, but they also were unable to see through society like their seniors who have been in the professional world and gone enough through trial and error to discern the fine line between water and land.</p> <p>Song Yao was the first to be unable to handle it all amongst the three of them. Since Song Yao’s achievements were higher than Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian’s, she also had to handle more pressure and injustice.</p> <p>They already felt the weight on their shoulders when they were working hard to protect the radio station as their fields to reap, let alone Song Yao who had to face the whole entertainment industry.</p> <p>It’s not like Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian didn’t have the anxiety of a twenty-six or twenty-seven-year-old.</p> <p>As long as someone was around the age of twenty-six to twenty-seven, who wouldn’t want to make a career for themselves?</p> <p>Lin Nuan suddenly thought of Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>The reason she could preserve herself and not give in because of what lay ahead was probably that, as she said, she just hadn’t met the man who had enough charm to conquer her.</p> <p>She thought, if the chief in charge of their radio station switched from Lee Zhiguo to Fu Huai’an, she would probably be here telling her friends that she was also one of the people who accepted the unspoken rules.</p> <p>Nobody was that virtuous, nobody was that filthy either. Devotion was just possible when temptation wasn’t strong enough.</p> <p>Song Yao’s words haunted her ears… Three days and that person let her forget Su Huan even existed, forget the despair and agony when she first broke up with Su Huan.</p> <p>Then should she agree to Fu Huai’an to give it a try? Maybe it could even successfully get rid of Wen Moshi’s shadow in her heart and give it a rebirth? After all, when she was with Fu Huai’an, the agony in her heart when she thought of Wen Moshi wouldn’t come out by itself.</p> <p>Thinking of that, Lin Nuan’s heart skipped a beat.</p> <p>In the past, Bai Xiaonian did convince Lin Nuan that the best cure for heartbreak was to enter another relationship. Lin Nuan, however. never even thought about it, since she felt it was a very despicable thing to do…</p> <p>But when the person in question was Fu Huai’an, it didn’t seem to be that unacceptable.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t touch a drop of wine that day. She was sober yet seemingly drunk at the same time – the thoughts in her head were left in a mess.</p> <p>Song Yao’s body was drunk, but her head was disturbingly clear.</p> <p>Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian only knew until the end that Song Yao’s wounds were from the man’s fiance asking someone to do it.</p>",
  "Chapter 106: Tuan Tuan Is a Bit Upset": "<p>Even if she became a mistress without knowing it, Song Yao didn’t deny she deserved a good beating. She didn’t report it to the police or speak out about it since she still had the identity of a celebrity. She can’t embarrass that person and all she could think about was silently putting the whole thing behind them; after she recovered for a while then she could return back to work.</p> <p>Song Yao’s phone had been ringing the whole night – it was the same caller ID and number.</p> <p>Lin Nuan guessed it was that man who took advantage of Song Yao using those “unspoken rules”. She muted the phone and helped Bai XIaonian carry Song Yao up on the bed to lay her down. She couldn’t fall asleep the whole night.</p> <p>…</p> <p>The next morning, LIn Nuan and Bai Xiaonian went out at three-ten sharp and reached the television station at four o’clock.</p> <p>Despite upper management notifying Lin Nuan to prepare for a new show and Bai Xiaonian leaving the broadcast channel, Miss Summer didn’t want to give the audience the impression of the Morning News switching hosts too frequently. Hence, she let Bai Xiaonian and Lin Nuan go on air together so they could familiarize themselves with the former. Then she would let Bai Xiaonian host alone starting next Monday.</p> <p>The two of them left after leaving Song Yao a note.</p> <p>They crossed arms on the way there, nobody mentioning anything about Song Yao.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian was a bit nervous going on air the first time on Morning News, yet she still gave an excellent performance.</p> <p>The regular audience of Bai Xiaonian and Lin Nuan’s broadcast show intentionally went to check out the Morning News and marveled over their beautiful appearances.</p> <p>The first show went well, especially because the audience feedback for Bai Xiaonian was as good as that of Lin Nuan’s first time on the show, hence Miss Summer was quite satisfied.</p> <p>In the makeup lounge, Bai Xiaonian and Lin Nuan removed their makeup as they discussed purchasing some medicine for Song Yao in the pharmaceutical shop later on the way back.</p> <p>“Song Yao’s identity is quite special. It’s not proper for her to go to the hospital with wounds like that on her face,” Lin Nuan said as she washed her face and dabbed it with a wipe.</p> <p>“I’m staying at your place these two days as well, I’ll just crash on the floor like last night. Later, I’ll go back to my place first to get some daily supplies…”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian put on her skincare and sunscreen in front of the mirror, along with a thin coat of lip gloss. She recalled what Song Yao said last night about having wrinkles around her eyes. She examined her face carefully in the mirror and discovered a few dry wrinkles right under her eyes. “Time really is cruel…”</p> <p>Miss Summer’s assistant, Yang Yuze, suddenly opened the door to the makeup lounge, holding hands with Tuan Tuan who was still in his pajamas and flip-flops with a backpack on him.</p> <p>“Mama!”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s round, black eyes were wet. As soon as he spotted Lin Nuan he broke free from Yang Yuze’s hand and wanted to come hug Lin Nuan’s leg…</p> <p>Lin Nuan unconsciously dodged away from him, which made Tuan Tuan immediately stand still before her, not daring to hug her.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan felt a bit upset as he looked up at Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Yang Yuze was shocked by how Tuan Tuan called her mother. He really couldn’t tell that Lin Nuan had a child already at that age when she was still so young.</p> <p>“The guard downstairs was careless and let this kid run into the broadcast building all by himself. The host of the Happily Ever After Show, Zhouxi, found him adorable and asked him why he came in. He replied he was trying to find you so I brought him all the way here…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t explain and thanked Yang Yuze. She shut the door and reached out to hug Tuan Tuan and put him on the sofa, unable to bear with his wet eyes…</p> <p>Tuan Tuan kept silent throughout like a good boy.</p> <p>“How did this kid get here? Is he all alone?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan kneeled down to ask Tuan Tuan, “How did you come here? Who sent you over? Auntie Lee?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan pondered about it for a while before leaping off the sofa and digging out a laptop from his backpack. He said, “I saw Mom in here… and then I showed the driver and he said Mom was quite awesome and that he knew where you were…”</p>",
  "Chapter 107: The Kid Came to Find Me": "<p>After asking for a while, Lin Nuan finally understood from his fumbling sentences that he snuck out when Auntie Li was in the kitchen. The kind-hearted cab driver saw a child on the streets early in the morning and let him get on the cab so he could ask where his parents were. Tuan Tuan showed him the “Morning News” and the driver brought Tuan Tuan here.</p> <p>Auntie Li must be worried sick since she couldn’t find the kid. Lin Nuan asked for Tuan Tuan’s home number. Tuan Tuan looked up and stared at Lin Nuan with his dark round eyes. He didn’t want to lie and risk being unliked by his mom, yet he also didn’t want to tell the truth and have her send him back.</p> <p>“The kid is too little, he must not remember it…” Bai Xiaonian took out a white bunny candy out of her purse and passed it to Tuan Tuan in her palm.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian actually liked Tuan Tuan a lot. Who wouldn’t like a child so adorable and pretty?</p> <p>Concerned that Auntie Li must be panicking, Lin Nuan’s only choice was to call Fu Huai’an so he could pass the message to Auntie Li.</p> <p>She picked up the phone and thought of Fu Huai’an… that forced kiss in the car, those words…</p> <p>Her ears grew red and her mouth still seemingly lingered with the taste of Fu Huai’an’s tobacco in it. Feeling tongue-tied, she pondered how to tell Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan suddenly tugged on her clothes. She moved her gaze from the phone to Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>He didn’t say anything – he just gazed up at her with those moist huge Bambi eyes of his.</p> <p>Lin Nuan surprisingly understood the look in his eyes. She bent down and patted his head as she asked, “Do you want to stay with me?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nodded furiously, the tip of his nose sniffling.</p> <p>He recalled how he went for the checkup holding Auntie Li’s hand in the hospital earlier. All the other kids had their parents to accompany them and hug them as they pampered their sweethearts to go do their checkups, yet he didn’t have a father… or mother by his side.</p> <p>At that time, he really missed his mom. He too wanted to cry in his mom’s arms and scream how he didn’t want to do the checkup. Then his mom would softly comfort him and say, good boy Tuan Tuan, after you do it, the doctor uncle can let us go back home!</p> <p>Tuan Tuan sniffed his nose and opened his arms wide to hug Lin Nuan’s leg. He buried his face into her leg and secretly teared up.</p> <p>Lin Nuan gently patted his small head and said, “But we still need to call your dad, otherwise he and Auntie Li will get worried if they can’t find you at all.”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan discreetly wiped away his tears on Lin Nuan’s pants and let go of her. He nodded and grabbed tightly onto Lin Nuan’s finger as if he was scared she would disappear the moment he let go.</p> <p>Lin Nuan held Tuan Tuan’s hand as she called Fu Huai’an, her grasp tightening on the phone.</p> <p>She seemed to be a lot more assured when Tuan Tuan was holding her hand.</p> <p>“Hey…”</p> <p>As he answered the call, Fu Huai’an’s magnetic and resonant voice traveled straight into her right ear, heating it up considerably.</p> <p>“Tuan Tuan ran outside the house this morning and he’s here with me now. I don’t have Auntie Li’s house number or yours, so I don’t know how to contact her…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan could hear Fu Huai’an let out a long sigh of relief on the other end of the line.</p> <p>“Pass the phone to Tuan Tuan,” he said in a serious and obviously angry tone.</p> <p>Lin Nuan took a look at Tuan Tuan who was gazing up at her with his adorable eyes. She said, “The child came to find me…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an understood what she meant by that. She was afraid he would scold Tuan Tuan and was hinting that he shouldn’t. And yet she didn’t want to ask him not to scold him right in front of Tuan Tuan, just so he wouldn’t get nervous…</p>",
  "Chapter 108: As If He Was Afraid of Being Abandoned": "<p>“You’re the child’s mother… It’s a given that he came to find you.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s low, rich voice carried an evident undertone of delight – which penetrated Lin Nuan’s body like a bolt of electricity.</p> <p>Lin Nuan had no idea how to respond to him when he put it that way.</p> <p>What did Fu Huai’an mean? Was he rushing Lin Nuan to consider it quickly and agree, otherwise Tuan Tuan would get scolded if she wasn’t his mother?</p> <p>How would anyone use their own son to threaten somebody?</p> <p>Was Fu Huai’an being overly shameless?</p> <p>“I’ll pass the phone to Tuan Tuan…” Lin Nuan said as she passed it over to him and told him it was his father calling.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s petite hand grabbed the phone while the other was unwilling to let go of Lin Nuan’s finger. Lin Nuan had to kneel down to hold up the phone next to his ear.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan hollered into the phone feeling somewhat guilty, “Papa…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan could hear Fu Huai’an’s harsh scolding near the phone. She intentionally turned her head to keep a distance between herself and the phone as the palm of her hand began to sweat.</p> <p>After he hung up the phone, Tuan Tuan didn’t seem disappointed like he should be after getting a scolding. His eyes looked like embedded, glistening stars. He grabbed Lin Nuan’s fingers even tighter.</p> <p>“Papa said, if Mama wants to have me, I can follow Mama!”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan succinctly summarized what Fu Huai’an said over the phone, yet he forgot to mention that Uncle Lu was going to deliver his luggage over to Mama’s house.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was shocked. She was originally planning to comfort Tuan Tuan in his disappointment yet the words were caught in her throat.</p> <p>“Are you bringing Tuan Tuan back to your place?” Bai Xiaonian glanced at him without waiting for Lin Nuan to respond, “Otherwise, I’ll take Song Yao to my place.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s house wasn’t big in the first place. With Bai Xiaonian and Song Yao staying over, not to mention how crowded it would be with three adults and a child, it wouldn’t be appropriate to let a child see the wounds on Song Yao’s face.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan looked at Lin Nuan with utmost anticipation, his soft hands clutching onto her finger, as if he was afraid to be abandoned.</p> <p>“I’ll tidy up the small bedroom today when I get back for me and Tuan Tuan to stay in. You don’t have to keep sleeping on the floor. Share the larger bed with Song Yao.”</p> <p>Yesterday, Song Yao came out of the blue, leaving her no time to clean up the small bedroom. Hence, Bai Xiaonian had to sleep on the floor since it wasn’t fit to sleep in. With Tuan Tuan coming over, it was about time to clean it up.</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked at Tuan Tuan’s smile which held such healing power. She felt perhaps letting Tuan Tuan come over would comfort Song Yao.</p> <p>“Let’s stay together!”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s mood turned as bright as day when he heard Lin Nuan say that. He was so excited he nearly leaped into the air. He loved Mama the most, and of course, Papa as well.</p> <p>“Go back and notify Song Yao first. I’ll take Tuan Tuan to the supermarket to buy some things…”</p> <p>Song Yao brought a case of vegetables and fruits when she came over – but she still needed daily supplies.</p> <p>Since Fu Huai’an was on a business trip for three days and about to return tomorrow or the day after, she also had to prepare some snacks and milk for Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>…</p> <p>The supermarket was under the Sheng De Building. The first floor sold children’s clothes and sports apparel.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was wearing pajamas – he obviously needed to get a new outfit.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t have any children and was thus unfamiliar with these children brands. As she looked down to ask him which shop he liked, she noticed he was looking at the door of a sportswear shop. Three models resembling a family was wearing the same style outfit.</p> <p>Lin Nuan followed his gaze and asked, “Do you like that outfit?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nodded.</p> <p>Lin Nuan brought him into that sportswear shop and let the assistant bring out the outfit the child model displayed outside for Tuan Tuan to try on.</p>",
  "Chapter 109: That Pr*ck, Lu Jinbei!": "<p>Tuan Tuan tugged on Lin Nuan, “Mama…”</p> <p>“Yes? Lin Nuan looked down at the soft and squishy Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>“Mama should wear it too…”</p> <p>“This little kid is so adorable! He wants to wear matching outfits with his mama!”</p> <p>The assistant wasn’t flattering them. From the moment Lin Nuan walked into the mall holding Tuan Tuan’s hand, the assistant girl standing at the door went outside to call for her colleague to come out and have a look at the incredibly cute Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>Unable to reject Tuan Tuan’s look that was full of anticipation, Lin Nuan let the assistant bring over the woman’s matching outfit.</p> <p>Lin Nuan and Tuan Tuan stood in front of the mirror next to each other wearing the exact same outfit. Tuan Tuan let out a beaming smile.</p> <p>“Madam… if you and your kid are going to wear this together, I’ll wrap up your outfits for you.”</p> <p>The assistant was quite eager to help and had already brought out new outfits for both of them.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was a bit taken aback from the title “Madam” – she didn’t know where and how to explain.</p> <p>She nodded awkwardly and passed her card to the assistant.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan tugged on the corner of her clothes and pointed at the male’s outfit with his chubby finger, “Papa…”</p> <p>“….” Lin Nuan was speechless.</p> <p>She could accept wearing the same outfit as Tuan Tuan, but with Fu Huai’an…</p> <p>As she pictured how he’d look in the same outfit, her throat suddenly grew dry.</p> <p>“Papa likes suits.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan said somewhat sheepishly – since she never saw his closet before.</p> <p>“Mama…” Tuan Tuan said in a soft voice, his tone hiding a hint of disappointment in it.</p> <p>Lin Nuan really wanted to reject him, but facing his anticipatory look, she finally said to the assistant with furrowed eyebrows, “Wrap up the male outfit as well.”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s eyes glowed, yet Lin Nuan’s face was burning hot.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the supermarket, Lin Nuan hugged Tuan Tuan and put him in the cart facing her arms. He could see the beautiful curves of her jawline if he looked upwards – he was so happy his ears turned red.</p> <p>“What flavor of toothpaste do you want, Tuan Tuan?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan pushed the cart as she picked out daily supplies like toothbrushes and towels for Tuan Tuan on the shelves. She compared them carefully.</p> <p>“Strawberry!”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan heard a child cry in the distance. He turned around and looked towards that direction.</p> <p>At the cashier, a little boy was hugging a toy as he cried and pleaded to have it. His mother roughly grabbed him by his arms and kicked his butt.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan turned back to gaze at Lin Nuan’s serene face, still in shock, and realized his mother was the best – and the softest – in the world.</p> <p>With their matching outfits, Tuan Tuan’s face beamed with contentment.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was just going to ask Tuan Tuan if he preferred a Captain America toothbrush or an Iron Man toothbrush when her phone rang.</p> <p>It was a stranger’s number.</p> <p>As she answered it…</p> <p>“Hello…” Lin Nuan said politely.</p> <p>“I’m Lu Jinnan, Brother Fu asked me to deliver Tuan Tuan’s daily supplies and clothes to your place. I sent my brother over and he’s downstairs—go down to collect them!”</p> <p>Lu Jinnan said quite clearly in a rushed tone. Lin Nuan could vaguely sense that his end of the line was rather busy.</p> <p>Lin Nuan put back the toothbrush in her hands and answered politely, “I’ll let my friend go downstairs to fetch the items first.”</p> <p>As she hung up, Bai Xiaonian coincidentally called. Lin Nuan told her Lu Jinnan’s brother was waiting downstairs and asked her to go collect the items.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Nuan brought Tuan Tuan back home with many bags of groceries. As she entered the house Bai Xiaonian helped take the bags in her hand. She had a bad expression on her face and didn’t say much.</p> <p>“Where’s Song Yao?”</p> <p>“Song Yao is still asleep…” Bai Xiaonian replied.</p> <p>After settling Tuan Tuan down in the living room to watch cartoons and eat yogurt, Bai Xiaonian and Lin Nuan entered the kitchen and placed the items in the fridge. Bai Xiaonian lowered her voice and said, “Do you know who Lu Jinnan’s brother is? That pr*ck, Lu Jinbei!”</p>",
  "Chapter 110: Good Boy Tuan Tuan": "<p>Lin Nuan was surprised by how small the world was.</p> <p>“Do you remember that time I told you Lu Jinbei said his brother killed someone for a woman and was in jail?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian said as she recalled how she’d had a meal with a murderer sitting right next to her. She suddenly felt terrified at that experience.</p> <p>Even though Lin Nuan didn’t really like Lu Jinnan as a person, objectively speaking he was the type that women especially adored. His skin was softer and fairer than most women, his dark, slender peach eyes seemed to be mysteriously smiling all the time, and he couldn’t hide the wild streak inside him. He had thin lips and an arched nose, with a look that was naturally charming yet cold at the same time.</p> <p>Lin Nuan guessed that Lu Jinnan wasn’t very likely to kill someone in the name of love, judging by his attitude of contempt towards women. It was more likely that he lost face or got jealous because of a woman.</p> <p>Lin Nuan thought of Fu Huai’an somehow – She thought of him being able to murder someone and come out of jail on his high horse wearing a suit as if nothing happened.</p> <p>In the “Men’s Taste” magazine introducing Fu Huai’an, it used a particular sentence to describe him: <em>Everyone in the lawyer world knew that Fu Huai’an could crack any case he wanted to.</em></p> <p>Lin Nuan could be certain that Lu Jinnan being able to come out of jail despite committing murder was because of Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>She recalled when she wrote essays in fifth grade; the other kids wanted to become scientists, doctors or teachers, yet Lin Nuan spoke from her heart that she wanted to be an exceptional lawyer when she grew up – to uphold justice in society. Her teacher and classmates praised her so much for being so ambitious and noble that she felt like she was floating.</p> <p>Yet Lin Nuan didn’t even have the courage to practice what she preached.</p> <p>Using Fu Huai’an as an example, he definitely was the most exceptional lawyer in his industry, so good that people were intimidated by the mere mention of his name. But all his cases were not used to uphold justice and law in the nation, but merely to defend the clients who could afford him – to defend their rights.</p> <p>Using a man’s money to eliminate him; that was an on-spot summary of the occupation of a lawyer.</p> <p>Lin Nuan only realized after growing up that words like justice and fairness didn’t exist in the lawyer world. Even the judge could hide his dark side from society.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After Song Yao got out of bed, she saw a pink and white meatball sitting in Lin Nuan’s living room, crossing his legs before the table as he ate his yogurt and watched cartoons. His mouth had a milk-stache on it, his eyes were dark and round, and the way his eyelashes glistened made her heart melt.</p> <p>As Bai Xiaonian and Lin Nuan finished organizing the fridge and came out, they saw Song Yao sitting on the sofa chatting with Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>“The wounds on Auntie’s face came from a fight, so don’t learn from me and fight with other people, good boy!”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nodded. “Tuan Tuan is a good boy and won’t fight!”</p> <p>He then put his yogurt on the table, stood up and dug through his pant pockets. He found the white bunny candy Bai Xiaonian gave him earlier that morning and shoved it at Song Yao in his chubby fair palm.</p> <p>“Papa said it won’t hurt after a piece of candy!”</p> <p>Song Yao looked at that piece of chocolate and her eyes suddenly watered up. She had the sudden impulse to embrace the kid into her arms.</p> <p>She rubbed her eyes and smiled, taking the candy from his palm. She opened the wrapper and tossed it into her mouth. It quickly melted away. She nodded, her eyes growing red. “Yes, it really doesn’t hurt anymore.”</p>",
  "Chapter 111: A Love Gone Too Far": "<p>It wasn’t just to placate the kid—the wounds on Song Yao’s body suddenly beamed with warmth and weren’t that painful anymore.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After lunch, Tuan Tuan volunteered to clean up the small room with Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian since he knew he would stay in it with Lin Nuan for the night.</p> <p>The room wasn’t as dirty as Lin Nuan had imagined – just a thin layer of dust. It wouldn’t take much effort to tidy it up.</p> <p>Lin Nuan removed the sheets and put them by the door to replace them with some new clean sheets. Tuan Tuan jumped off the couch despite being comfortably half-asleep half a minute ago. He skittled over to the door of the room, stuck out his butt, opened his arms wide and picked up the sheets covered with dust, which irritated his nose and made him sneeze.</p> <p>The sheets were crumpled up into a ball and were a bit too heavy for Tuan Tuan to carry. Lin Nuan looked back and saw him half-dragging those sheets towards the washing machine, wobbling like a penguin.</p> <p>Lin Nuan ran over and lifted up the sheets he was dragging on the floor. Tuan Tuan turned around and saw Lin Nuan standing behind him…</p> <p>She cleared her throat and smiled. “Wait for Auntie Xiaonian to make the bed – you can sleep on the little bed for a while.”</p> <p>“It’s Sister!” Bai Xiaonian emphasized, still feeling it wasn’t enough. She repeated herself to Tuan Tuan, “Tuan Tuan… repeat after me, it’s SISTER Xiaonian!”</p> <p>“Then are you going to call Nuan Nuan ‘Auntie’?” Song Xiao shot back at Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Lin Nuan snickered and asked Tuan Tuan, “Do you want to sleep for a while?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan opened his eyes wide and shook his head to show he was still awake. “I’m not sleepy!”</p> <p>After she tossed the dirty sheets into the washing machine, Lin Nuan let Tuan Tuan step in the tiny wooden stool so she could wash his little hands and face. She said she would lay in bed with him for a short while and he was so happy that he nodded eagerly.</p> <p>Using the time Lin Nuan washed her face, Tuan Tuan dragged out his little wool blanket from the luggage that Lu Jinbei delivered and hugged it as he waited for her at the door of the bathroom.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Tuan Tuan lay in the bed next to Lin Nuan and fell fast asleep.</p> <p>With the door of the room nearly open, Lin Nuan could vaguely hear Bai Xiaonian and Song Yao talking…</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian was tidying up the dishes that she didn’t have time to wash that afternoon. Song Yao couldn’t help much – she leaned on the door of the kitchen and said to Bai Xiaonian, “Are you and Nuan Nuan really disappointed that I didn’t keep our promise?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian didn’t say anything for a moment. After the water stopped running, she then replied, “Last night after you got drunk and fell asleep wę had a conversation… about what rights did we have in the end? We don’t have a good background or support network – we can only use a decently young body and a decently pretty face – but both of these will quickly fade away with time.”</p> <p>“Something happened in the radio station a while ago – the famously beautiful Wu Qianying and the chief executive of the broadcasting department were role-playing in the office and were caught red-handed by Li Zhiguo’s wife. She was beaten up pretty badly. The news got leaked online and now Wu Qianying’s carer is pretty much over…”</p> <p>Song Yao was reminded of herself when she heard Wu Qianying being beaten up by someone because she followed the “unspoken rules”.</p> <p>After being taken advantage of, Lin Nuan and Song Yao both knew Bai Xiaonian hated mistresses. Yet she hated jerks even more—there was no innocent one in the game for two.</p> <p>“I thought what Wu Qianying did was despicable when she clearly knew the man had a wife yet still went for him. But if she had some support behind her, if it was the manager or her father and it was effortless for her to go on any channel she wanted, why would she even need to compromise herself for a balding, oily, disgusting middle-aged man like Li Zhiguo? I just can’t bring myself to believe a girl blossoming at her age wouldn’t like a handsome man, and instead fall for a fat, balding, morally degraded middle-aged uncle.”</p>",
  "Chapter 112: Ask Her What She Was Hiding From": "<p>“I don’t know if this counts as having bad life values, but your matter made me feel that you’re indeed strict on yourself! If the person in charge of the broadcasting department was a rather decent-looking young man, seeing my desire for the news anchor position, I would have also given in!”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian was still chatting with Song Yao, but Lin Nuan had already fallen asleep in her half-awake, half-asleep state.</p> <p>Probably since Tuan Tuan was lying beside her, Lin Nuan’s dream was actually filled with Fu Huai’an with his neat suit and deep gaze.</p> <p>She dreamt that when she exited the news broadcasting room, she saw Fu Huai’an standing by the door beside the trash bin as he smoked. He had one hand in his pocket while the other held onto the cigarette, tapping the cigarette ashes into the ashtray at the top of the bin, the suit highlighting his perfect back muscles as he moved. His detailed sleeves peeked out and the wristwatch that matched his suit made him look extremely outstanding and eye-catching.</p> <p>In the dream, Lin Nuan was wearing the white suit jacket she wore for broadcasts for her upper half while she wore comfortable sweatpants and slippers at the bottom. Many hosts were like that, after all, broadcasts only revealed their upper halves!</p> <p>It was nothing originally, but meeting Fu Huai’an like that made Lin Nuan so awkward that she was at a loss for what to do…</p> <p>Lin Nuan hurriedly turned around to return to the broadcasting room, but she was caught by Fu Huai’an’s dark gaze that flickered over. His deep attractive voice called for her, so she anxiously turned back to look at him with an embarrassed smile.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an put out the cigarette and walked to Lin Nuan with a hint of a smile on his face and both hands in his pockets, jacket unbuttoned, looking down at Lin Nuan who was looking to escape – and then he asked her what she was hiding from.</p> <p>Lin Nuan couldn’t discern reality from her dreams and her face involuntarily turned red.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an then asked Lin Nuan if she had considered it, whether she was willing to date him, and forcefully cornered her as she kept retreating, unable to answer… She ended up pressed against the wall by Fu Huai’an as he kissed her, leaving her feeling suffocated and dizzy.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian’s anxious voice rang beside her ears and she stood at the end of the corridor, shouting at Lin Nuan that the teacher was coming and if she got caught being in a relationship at such a young age she would be doomed. Lin Nuan clearly knew that something was wrong, but panic still filled her heart and she harshly pushed at Fu Huai’an’s chest, but the moment she pushed him away, she saw Wen Moshen’s face.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was shocked awake immediately.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian had one hand on the door handle and the other on the door frame as she told Lin Nuan, “Hurry up and wake up! The station president and several vice presidents have been removed from their positions without any advanced warning, and they’ve been replaced by new people that have never appeared before. They’re now calling us back for an emergency meeting.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan had yet to fully recover from the shock and her heart beat at a fast pace as she turned to look at Tuan Tuan who was still sound asleep. She nodded her head.</p> <p>After getting out of the bed, she washed her face and left Tuan Tuan for Song Yao to take care of before she rushed back to the station with Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s place was relatively closer to Haicheng’s broadcast building so when they arrived, the meeting had yet to start and many were still rushing over.</p> <p>Everyone in the building looked anxious and the staff and hosts with no broadcasting going on grouped together to discuss the matter of the president and vice presidents suddenly being fired.</p> <p>Miss Xia’s assistant, Yang Yuze, was considered the most well-connected, but even he didn’t hear the slightest hint regarding the matter.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian rushing over, Yang Yuze who was sitting in his cubicle while engaged in a discussion with a colleague waved them over with a serious look on his face.</p>",
  "Chapter 113: Tell It Was Fu Huai’an at First Glance": "<p>Bai Xiaonian went over to inquire about the situation.</p> <p>Yang Yuze was clueless too and he shrugged helplessly.</p> <p>“Miss Xia was watching the broadcast inside the recording studio when she suddenly received a call and left. After a while, I got a call from Miss Xia’s to gather all staff working on the few programs under her supervision including the journalists on field work to wait here for her to finish the meeting. The general situation should probably be known only when Miss Xia comes back.”</p> <p>As Yang Yuze was speaking, the hosts of a few other programs gradually arrived.</p> <p>Even the high-ranking senior host of Haicheng’s program “The Country’s Knowledge Vault”, Xue Zhiren, also known as Old Mr. Xue, came in personally. The old man was a legendary but rarely seen host in the building.</p> <p>Yang Yuze immediately welcomed him respectfully along with other slightly famous hosts and program editors who went to greet him, some out of respect for a senior and others simply trying to introduce themselves to him.</p> <p>Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian greeted the old man from a distance and continued waiting for Miss Xia to come back and hold the meeting at a less crowded corner.</p> <p>Since they did not know what time Miss Xia would return, nobody dared to leave.</p> <p>After all, the matter was too huge and the news was covered up too discreetly, so sudden that everyone was at a loss for what to do. With everyone panicking, who wouldn’t want to get</p> <p>some first-hand news?</p> <p>For the first time, the morning news department was quite lively as everyone returned anxiously to try and exchange news with other people in an attempt to understand the situation clearly, but to no avail.</p> <p>Yang Yuze was surrounded by the colleagues of the morning news department as they noisily bombarded him with questions, and he had to patiently explain that he really did not know anything.</p> <p>The journalists doing fieldwork along with their camera crew were originally working for the news announcements, but they quickly rushed back after being notified. They did not even put down their equipment before they dove into the crowd to get more clues.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian and Lin Nuan hid further away.</p> <p>“Do you think that with their passionate discussion, they can really deduce the truth?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian stood inside a cubicle and leaned against the edge of the desk with her two hands, her finger accidentally touching the mouse and the dark screen lit up immediately.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s gaze swept across the computer screen and froze, replying distractedly, “I don’t know…”</p> <p>On the screen was the latest celebrity gossip.</p> <p>What truly attracted Lin Nuan was the attached photo displayed on the screen.</p> <p>In the photo, in front of a black car parked at a club entrance, was a female celebrity who was wearing a tight-fitting dress and heels that accentuated her hot figure, her slender arm hugging the waist of a tall man with long legs.</p> <p>Lin Nuan not only found the man familiar, but she could also tell it was Fu Huai’an at first glance.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an had a cigarette in his mouth while his jacket and shirt were unbuttoned. He had both hands in his pocket while he simply stood there and let the female celebrity hug him. Even though it was just a side-view that did not capture clearly Fu Huai’an’s facial features, but his elegant and stable aura remained imposing.</p> <p>Her gaze uncontrollably looked towards the photo once more and she reached out her hand to the mouse and scrolled through the page to see that the title of the article was “Su Manman drunk at club, mysterious boyfriend appears to bring her back.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt her heart being harshly squeezed for some reason and remembered that day in the car when Fu Huai’an picked up the call, as well as the intimate and soft tone of the woman’s voice on the other end of the line.</p>",
  "Chapter 114: Pretended to Reply Honestly": "<p>Lin Nuan had heard Song Yao mention Su Manman before. Her acting skills were average… Her looks were extremely outstanding so even though these few years she had never won any huge prizes or pushed out many works, she was still gorgeous and popular, to the point where she was even known overseas.</p> <p>Lin Nuan only briefly looked through the words, while she focused on every single photo attached.</p> <p>The first showed Su Manman being brought out of the club while Fu Huai’an remained still with both hands in his pocket. Su Manman gave him a bright smile.</p> <p>The second was Su Manman hugging Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>The third had Fu Huai’an opening the car door on the passenger side and helping Su Manman get in the seat.</p> <p>The fourth was Fu Huai’an parking the car at the front of a high-class condominium building and helping Su Manman out of the car.</p> <p>The fifth showed the car leaving the building in the morning.</p> <p>“Do you like Su Manman too?”</p> <p>The owner of the cubicle returned to see Lin Nuan looking at the news article she opened more than an hour ago and smiled while asking.</p> <p>Lin Nuan smiled and said, “Sorry, I used your computer without your permission.”</p> <p>“It’s fine, it’s fine… Don’t think too much about it!” The female editor gave a friendly smile to Lin Nuan and said, “I really like Su Manman, and also you and Xiaonian. I think all of you look super pretty! Um… can you give me your autograph?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan nodded her head and said, “Sure…”</p> <p>The female editor quickly took out a book and pen from her drawer and passed them to Lin Nuan who signed it solemnly, then the editor looked towards Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian had a look that said ‘I feel you’ and she signed the book. The female editor was extremely happy and started sharing the gossip she knew with Lin Nuan and Bai Xiaonian.</p> <p>“My friend used to be Su Manman’s assistant. They heard that Su Manman’s path in the industry has always been smooth-sailing and she’s one of the few female celebrities that other people don’t dare to touch. Just when she debuted, she already announced that she had a boyfriend but no one had ever seen him before. During the time my friend worked as her assistant, he had never appeared before and the paparazzi never caught anything. Everyone said that either this boyfriend did not exist, or Su Manman’s boyfriend was so strong that other people didn’t dare to expose him!”</p> <p>The editor in the neighboring article peeked in and interrupted them, saying, “I think Su Manman’s boyfriend belongs to the latter. Look at that aura… He’s clearly special and different.”</p> <p>Someone else added in again…</p> <p>“A big celebrity and a big boss are an ideal couple. The larger her presence is, the stronger the man behind her is, but whether or not such a strong man has any other women is hard to say!”</p> <p>“How can wealthy men be satisfied with only one woman?”</p> <p>The atmosphere that was originally heavy lessened in tension due to the discussion of celebrity gossip, and the contents of the discussion slowly shifted from gossip to relationships between men and women.</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian had eaten with Fu Huai’an twice and could slightly recognize that it was him in the photos, plus the fact that Lin Nuan, who had always been uninterested in gossip articles, looked through that one so seriously, she couldn’t help keeping an eye on it.</p> <p>Behind the others, Bai Xiaonian asked in the breakroom, “Is that person in the photos, the one with Su Manman, Fu Huai’an?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan made a cup of coffee and put in two cubes of sugar before stirring it. She looked up at Bai Xiaonian and asked, “You mean the photos just now?”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian nodded.</p> <p>“Should be… I’m not sure, I’m not very familiar with Fu Huai’an, and the photo didn’t expose his face from the front.” Lin Nuan drank a mouthful of her coffee and pretended to reply honestly.</p>",
  "Chapter 115: Am I Right?": "<p>She said it as though it were really true, but even Bai Xiaonian who had only met Fu Huai’an a few times could recognize it was him. How could Lin Nuan who was close to getting married to Fu Huai’an not recognize him?</p> <p>A teasing smile appeared on the corner of Bai Xiaonian’s lips, and she elbowed Lin Nuan’s arm, asking, “Are you jealous?”</p> <p>“What are you saying?!”</p> <p>Lin Nuan purposely ignored the embarrassment in her heart and put down the cup in her hands to add another sugar cube.</p> <p>“If your heart is what’s bitter, it doesn’t matter how many sugar cubes you add!” Bai Xiaonian teased Lin Nuan, saying, “It’s only a paparazzi article, you don’t have to take it to heart.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian’s words were comforting but even as she said them, she had no confidence in the truth. After all, the photo of Su Manman hugging Fu Huai’an couldn’t be faked, and it was also true that Fu Huai’an helped her into his car instead of pushing her away.</p> <p>After adding the sugar cube, the coffee no longer tasted that bitter and Lin Nuan tightened her grip on the cup as she lowered her gaze onto it. She could smell the fragrance of the coffee between every breath and seeing that there was no one around, she then slowly opened her mouth, speaking with a neutral and calm tone.</p> <p>“I’m not at a position to care too much about Fu Huai’an’s matters.”</p> <p>Bai Xiaonian pursed her lips instead of replying, simply looking at Lin Nuan who kept her eyes down and sipped on her coffee. She guessed that Lin Nuan might have said so because… Perhaps she still couldn’t let go of Wen Moshen.</p> <p>Lin Nuan sat on the sofa by the window with one hand under her chin and looked out at the sunlight outside, thinking of the unintentional sentence by her colleague, that rich men wouldn’t be happy with just one woman.</p> <p>It wasn’t Lin Nuan’s first time hearing these words…</p> <p>She remembered that when she was young and still the Lin family’s daughter, their school organized a trip to the museum in first grade. Afterward, she went to the company opposite the museum to find her father, falling asleep on the couch in his office after finishing her assignment.</p> <p>While she was stirring awake, she heard a soft feminine voice saying, “Men like you, as long as you have money and power, how could you be satisfied with having only one woman? To all of you, women are like dishes; even though you like rock sugar trotters the most, but you still want to try tasting the other dishes on the table. Your wife is your rock sugar trotters, and I… am the steamed fish on the table, am I right?”</p> <p>Little Lin Nuan sat up on the sofa and Father Lin’s suit jacket that was covering her body fell to the floor, the sound alarming the man and woman talking. The secretary wearing a tight formal dress immediately stood up from Father Lin’s lap and smiled calmly at him, saying, “High heels are bad, if it wasn’t for President Lin helping me, I would’ve had a terrible fall.”</p> <p>Young Lin Nuan was clueless and truly thought that the secretary had fallen into her father’s arms, but Lin Nuan had never forgotten her words.</p> <p>Even if Father Lin remained loving and doting with Liang Mulan at home, on the outside he would always have women to “represent and entertain”, let alone unmarried wealthy bachelors like Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>The words Fu Huai’an told Lin Nuan mysteriously appeared in her mind once more and Lin Nuan couldn’t help but wonder… whether Fu Huai’an told “every dish” on the table the same words, and if so, was Su Manman his favorite, rock sugar trotters?</p> <p>Just as Lin Nuan was spacing out, she heard footsteps approaching and she turned her head to see Bai Xiaonian jogging over, saying, “The new president’s assistant had lunchboxes brought over for the staff.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood up and felt the phone in her pocket vibrating, she took it out and glanced at it… The caller ID showed Fu Huai’an’s name.</p> <p>She thought for a moment before muting her phone and placing it back in her pocket, walking towards the breakroom again.</p>",
  "Chapter 116: This Is Our President?": "<p>Everyone waited until the afternoon and the station let someone come over to count the number of people so they could distribute the lunchboxes.</p> <p>The one walking at the very front of the staff bringing lunch was apparently the new president’s assistant and he was visiting the staff of different programs one by one to personally distribute lunch, notifying them that the new president was still in a meeting with the higher-ups but they had no idea when it would end. They apologized and asked that everyone wait a while longer because an even more important announcement would follow. He said all that in an extremely polite manner.</p> <p>People guessed that it was the first fire the new president was starting.</p> <p>The contents of the lunchboxes were plentiful, and soon, someone even sent over desserts, coffee, and milk tea, making everyone’s curiosity towards the new president reach a new peak.</p> <p>The change in the president and vice presidents had led to a huge uproar and it wouldn’t be a small issue, so everyone held their breaths as they waited.</p> <p>By 6.15p.m. in the evening, Miss Xia returned and simply summarized the change in the higher-ups in the station, and at 6.30p.m., all the television screens in the building displayed the new president giving her speech.</p> <p>Out of everyone’s expectations, the new president was a young lady called Chu Qian.</p> <p>On the screen, Chu Qian wore a black suit with a white silk blouse that had a v-collar, with a neat and pretty bow tied under her collar. Her center-parted black hair was tied up, revealing her full forehead and beautiful facial features, outlining her elegance and sharpness.</p> <p>“This is our president? So young? Her looks wouldn’t lose to our female hosts! Could she be an assistant or secretary?”</p> <p>At first, the ones who were most excited weren’t the male colleagues, but the women in the building as they whispered to each other, discussing Chu Qian’s looks and age.</p> <p>The more curious ones searched for Chu Qian’s information online, if they hadn’t checked they wouldn’t have known anything… Once they checked, they received a huge shock, and soon, the legend of President Chu spread across the whole building.</p> <p>33-year-old Chu Qian had won the highest award in the news industry, the Pulitzer Prize, as well as the Ronald Reagan Media Award.</p> <p>She was once a war reporter that was on the front-line of the Iraq war and the Libyan Civil War, exposing the cruel murders committed upon the innocents by the soldiers, and the huge pain brought to the citizens by war.</p> <p>She had also once infiltrated the Golden Triangle by herself and had faced a battle of wits against the drug dealers to collect information, almost losing her life in the Golden Triangle. But the information she brought back had been instrumental in taking down the criminal organization.</p> <p>What was even more surprising was that their new president Chu Qian had infiltrated a terrorist group all because of one clue found in human trafficking news.</p> <p>The internet even called Chu Qian “The Iron Lady of The News Industry”.</p> <p>Chu Qian’s speech was simple and after it finished, Miss Xia gave everyone a short meeting before ending it all.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was worried about Tuan Tuan and Song Yao alone at home so she wanted to go home first, while Bai Xiaonian said she wanted to stay in the building to get more information.</p> <p>Lin Nuan entered the elevator and took out the phone in her pocket to see one missed call from Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>She gripped her phone, hesitant on whether or not to call back. After all, Fu Huai’an’s son was at her place, maybe Fu Huai’an was calling to ask about Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>Ding—</p>",
  "Chapter 117: Ideal Rich and Beautiful Lady": "<p>The lift stopped on the 19th floor and a few ladies heatedly discussing Chu Qian’s legendary life were standing by the entrance. Lin Nuan walked further inside to free up the entrance.</p> <p>“Our president is also the Haixing Organization’s second daughter, the ideal rich and beautiful lady. Her shocking life doesn’t need any explanation at all!”</p> <p>“She’s Haixing Organization’s young lady, but she still works so hard?”</p> <p>“That’s why I said, the ones who are prettier, better and richer than us are all working hard, so we really have to work even harder!”</p> <p>Even though everyone had been panicking before, but once the legendary president appeared on screen with a serious face and gave her speech, it made the atmosphere in the building more lively than before. The words “president” and “Chu Qian” could be heard everywhere.</p> <p>Up until she exited the building, Lin Nuan still hadn’t returned Fu Huai’an’s call.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Nuan bought cake and fruits along the way back.</p> <p>When she entered the door, she saw that Tuan Tuan was already awake and his luggage was open in the living room, the toys inside placed neatly. Tuan Tuan kneeled on the dining chair by himself, half of his body pressing onto the dining table as he used his watercolor pencils to draw something.</p> <p>“Tuan Tuan… Where’s that Auntie?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan placed the cake and fruits on top of the shoe cabinet and after she slipped one foot into her slippers, she saw clear men’s footprints on the floor.</p> <p>Her heart panicked slightly as her gaze swept across the living room, balcony, and even the kitchen. Fu Huai’an was nowhere to be seen, but her heart couldn’t relax completely yet.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an said he had to go overseas for three days, so… he couldn’t be at her house.</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood at the entrance, hesitating,</p> <p>“Mama!”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan heard the noise and turned around to look at Lin Nuan, his hands holding onto the edge of the table as he experimentally stretched out one leg to try and step on the floor. It was quite a distance and a dangerous move. If his hands slipped or if he failed to stand properly he could hit his head on the floor, which was no joke.</p> <p>“Tuan Tuan!” Lin Nuan couldn’t even wear her other slipper in time as she quickly ran over to Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>Fortunately, Tuan Tuan landed on the floor safely without any accidents.</p> <p>“Auntie is sleeping…” Tuan Tuan cluelessly looked up at Lin Nuan, his white t-shirt dyed colorfully from the watercolor pens… Even his small chubby hands and face had colors on them.</p> <p>Lin Nuan brought Tuan Tuan to the bathroom and washed his face and hands clean, before going to his luggage to find a suitable t-shirt for him to change into.</p> <p>Once she turned around, she saw Tuan Tuan’s chubby hands tugging at the bottom of his t-shirt and he pulled upwards. He quickly stripped himself, obediently stretching out his arms and waiting for Lin Nuan to help him wear his clothes.</p> <p>After helping him change, Lin Nuan kneeled in front of Tuan Tuan and used a tissue to wipe his fringe that got wet when she washed his face, asking cautiously, “Did anyone come to the house today?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan’s hands held onto Lin Nuan’s shoulders for support and nodded his head after seriously pondering, saying, “The delivery uncle…”</p> <p>Just a delivery, did he need to enter the house?</p> <p>“Was Auntie the one who opened the door?” Lin Nuan asked.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nodded his head again and Lin Nuan took the chance to educate Tuan Tuan, saying, “In the future, if there are no adults at home, you shouldn’t just open the door for others, do you understand?”</p> <p>“I got it!” Tuan Tuan answered in his soft and cute voice, his chubby hands on Lin Nuan’s shoulders. He really wanted to enter Lin Nuan’s embrace and hug his Mama like other kids did, but he didn’t dare to.</p> <p>“Mama…” Tuan Tuan suddenly called for Lin Nuan with his head down, his ears red, looking extremely shy.</p>",
  "Chapter 118: It’s Papa!": "<p>Lin Nuan’s lips parted but no sound came out. That afternoon, after seeing the photos of Fu Huai’an with the female celebrity Su Manman, she didn’t know what outcome she’d end up having with Fu Huai’an. She was afraid that if she answered Tuan Tuan, how would Fu Huai’an’s wife interact with Tuan Tuan in the future…</p> <p>“Mama…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t respond, so Tuan Tuan called out again, to test her response.</p> <p>Eventually, she surrendered under the child’s anticipating and scared gaze. Lin Nuan pursed her lips and answered, “En?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan crumpled the tissue she used to wipe Tuan Tuan’s fringe into a ball and her long fingers fiddled with the child’s wet strands of hair.</p> <p>“Can I hug you?” Tuan Tuan asked softly, as though he was afraid that Lin Nuan would not agree, he reached out a short chubby finger and looked at her in anticipation, saying, “Just for a little while…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s finger poked Tuan Tuan’s chubby face, and she brought Tuan Tuan into her arms with a slight smile.</p> <p>The small child hugged Lin Nuan’s neck with his arms and pressed his pink face onto Lin Nuan’s shoulder, his eyes suddenly wet, looking like he was about to cry.</p> <p>Sensing the change in Tuan Tuan’s emotions, Lin Nuan softly asked, “Tuan Tuan, do you want to eat cake?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan heard Lin Nuan’s soft voice and forced his tears back, nodding his head.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan always liked sweet foods like cake, but Fu Huai’an strictly controlled Tuan Tuan’s sweets intake. He always said that every time Tuan Tuan did a check-up he would be overweight…</p> <p>Lin Nuan stood up and Tuan Tuan acted like a little tail, following behind her step by step.</p> <p>She placed the cake and her phone on the dining table, opening the cake’s packaging as she looked at Tuan Tuan’s work of art, a few colorful circles. Lin Nuan totally couldn’t tell what it was…</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Nuan was interested in his drawing, Tuan Tuan supported himself on the dining chair and climbed up.</p> <p>“This is Mama…” Tuan Tuan’s chubby hand pointed to the pink circle, excitedly introducing it to Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked at it seriously and even though she couldn’t tell how it looked like her, she still nodded and praised him, saying, “En… You drew well!”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was a little proud and pointed to the small circle in the middle, saying, “This is Tuan Tuan…”</p> <p>His small hand moved to the black circle beside it and said, “This is Papa!”</p> <p>The moment the words Papa left Tuan Tuan’s mouth, Lin Nuan’s phone on the dining table rang and the screen showed Fu Huai’an’s name.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan was still young and couldn’t recognize a lot of words, but he distinctly remembered Fu Huai’an’s name. He looked towards Lin Nuan excitedly, saying, “It’s Papa!”</p> <p>Too embarrassed to ignore Fu Huai’an’s call in front of the child, Lin Nuan picked up her phone and asked Tuan Tuan, “Do you want to talk to Papa?”</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nodded obediently, saying, “Yes!”</p> <p>Once she picked up the call, Lin Nuan passed the phone to Tuan Tuan, the child’s small hands were too small to hold on to the phone so he hugged Lin Nuan’s arm and called at the phone sweetly, “Papa, are you back?”</p> <p>“En, let your Mama come to the phone.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s deep voice entered Lin Nuan’s ears and she guessed that Fu Huai’an had seen through her attempt at escaping. Lin Nuan cleared her throat and under Tuan Tuan’s wide-eyed gaze, she straightened up and acted casual as she took over the phone, asking, “Is there anything you want, Mr. Fu?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan purposely pulled the distance between her and Fu Huai’an apart with the term. Fu Huai’an was no longer a clueless young boy; he could clearly understand.</p> <p>“I’m picking Tuan Tuan up tonight.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s attractive voice traveled from the other end of the line and said that sentence, mysteriously stirring up the peace in Lin Nuan’s heart.</p>",
  "Chapter 119: Sit in the Back With Tuan Tuan": "<p>“Alright.” Lin Nuan looked at Tuan Tuan who was stretching his neck to look up and tightened her grip on her phone as she tried to sound polite, saying, “What time are you coming over? I’ll pack up Tuan Tuan’s belongings.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan faintly heard from the other end of the line the sound of Fu Huai’an’s assistant calling out for Mr. Fu, followed by the light sounds of the tip of a pen scraping against paper.</p> <p>“If it goes smoothly, I’ll probably be there by 10.30p.m,” Fu Huai’an replied calmly.</p> <p>Understanding that Fu Huai’an was still busy, Lin Nuan simply said, “Okay.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Fu Huai’an was always punctual, but today, there was no call from him by 10.40p.m.</p> <p>Remembering that Fu Huai’an said that if all went well he would be there by 10.30p.m., Lin Nuan frowned, wondering if that meant that something went wrong.</p> <p>She thought of calling Fu Huai’an to tell him that Tuan Tuan had fallen asleep so he should fetch the kid tomorrow, but she wasn’t his real mother so she had no reason to keep the child with her.</p> <p>On the sofa, Tuan Tuan was so tired that his eyes had closed shut and he had a blanket draped over him, his head laying beside Lin Nuan’s legs. He slept peacefully, his little face dimly illuminated by the light from the TV screen.</p> <p>Song Yao and Bai Xiaonian had already fallen asleep.</p> <p>Song Yao had been in low spirits for the past few days so she slept a lot, while Bai Xiaonian had a broadcast the next morning and had to wake up at 3a.m. so she had to sleep early.</p> <p>Lin Nuan hadn’t washed up, simply sitting on the sofa as she used the remote control to constantly switch channels, distracted.</p> <p>At 10.50p.m., Lin Nuan finally received Fu Huai’an’s call saying that he was already downstairs.</p> <p>Lin Nuan couldn’t bear to wake Tuan Tuan up so she wrapped him up in the blanket and carried him. The little boy’s eyelashes fluttered slightly before he fell back asleep in Lin Nuan’s arms.</p> <p>Lin Nuan’s desire to call Fu Huai’an to ask him to pick Tuan Tuan up tomorrow grew stronger but she was afraid that the call would make Fu Huai’an misunderstand her intentions, so after some thought, Lin Nuan added another layer of her jacket around Tuan Tuan before she went downstairs.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At the entrance of the apartment building, a black car was parked under the streetlight. Fu Huai’an leaned against the car door of the passenger side with a cigarette in his mouth and a hand in his pocket, his long fingers scrolling through the e-mails on his phone.</p> <p>He wore a dark blue suit with a white shirt underneath, no tie around his collar which was unbuttoned at the top. The dim light from his phone outlined his face and Adam’s apple, adding on to his heavy aura.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s tall figure assured that even if he was simply standing there, the aura around him was still too strong to ignore.</p> <p>Lin Nuan carried the child out of the elevator and saw Fu Huai’an standing beside the car. She paused her steps and took a deep breath, adjusting her feelings before walking towards him once more.</p> <p>As though he could sense her, Fu Huai’an raised his head, his dark gaze looking directly towards Lin Nuan.</p> <p>Seeing that she was holding a sleeping Tuan Tuan, Fu Huai’an locked his phone and placed it into his pocket, his long legs going up the stairs to throw the remaining half of the cigarette into the bin and hold the building door open for Lin Nuan.</p> <p>After going nearer, Lin Nuan could clearly see that Fu Huai’an looked slightly tired, even though it did not affect his intimidating aura.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t see Fu Huai’an’s assistant and was just thinking how Fu Huai’an would bring the sleeping Tuan Tuan home by himself. She wondered if she should ask to let Tuan Tuan stay the night.</p> <p>“How about—”</p> <p>“You sit in the back with Tuan Tuan.”</p> <p>Without giving Lin Nuan the opportunity to speak, Fu Huai’an’s deep voice was decisive and allowed no room for discussion.</p> <p>Lin Nuan raised her head and met Fu Huai’an’s deep gaze. Unable to ignore his masculine charisma, her gaze dropped onto Fu Huai’an’s unbuttoned suit…</p>",
  "Chapter 120: No Knowing Whether I’m Used to It": "<p>That outfit… and the suit that was shown on the photos in the article, should be the same one.</p> <p>She always felt that Fu Huai’an was a man who had high living standards—at least whenever she saw him… She had never seen him wear the same piece of clothing for two days straight.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Nuan stay quiet, Fu Huai’an continued, “It’ll be too late later. I’ll let the driver send you back here.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an indeed couldn’t carry Tuan Tuan while driving by himself.</p> <p>The night wind was slightly chilly so when Lin Nuan was going down, she wrapped her jacket around Tuan Tuan. With the wind blowing over, goosebumps appeared on Lin Nuan’s arm.</p> <p>Tuan Tuan nudged closer towards Lin Nuan’s warm embrace, his chubby cheeks pressing against her arms.</p> <p>She couldn’t bear to wake him up so she nodded her head.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an opened the backseat door for Lin Nuan, who carefully sat inside while carrying Tuan Tuan.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s scent filled the whole car, mixed with the faint smell of nicotine, it surrounded Lin Nuan and reminding her of how Fu Huai’an had opened the backseat car door for Su Manman in the gossip article. She faintly felt a sense of uneasiness.</p> <p>The man’s tall figure stood beside the car door while she had one hand on top of the car. Fu Huai’an watched as Lin Nuan bent down and adjusted her grip on the child before he said, “Isn’t it too cold to come downstairs wearing only a t-shirt?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked at Fu Huai’an’s deep-set eyes and said, “I won’t be cold if the door is closed.”</p> <p>These words sounded uneven, as though the speaker was angry…</p> <p>Instead of looking at Fu Huai’an, Lin Nuan shifted her gaze to Tuan Tuan who was deep asleep and patted him gently, as though she was unwilling to talk to Fu Huai’an because she was afraid of waking the child up.</p> <p>Under the dim orange light of the street lamp, Lin Nuan’s face remained calm and Fu Huai’an watched as she focused her gaze on Tuan Tuan, her eyelashes covering that clear gaze. He didn’t say anything, simply closing the door for Lin Nuan. He sat on the driver’s seat, placed his jacket onto the passenger seat before he started up the engine.</p> <p>Exiting the area, the car quickly went onto the main road.</p> <p>The interior of the car remained quiet, lacking even the sound of a radio broadcast, and Fu Huai’an turned on the slightly warm heater.</p> <p>The car passed endless streetlights, illuminating Fu Huai’an’s profile.</p> <p>Lin Nuan felt that the atmosphere was awkward, and she looked out the window.</p> <p>Red light.</p> <p>Beside the car, a young man around 20 years old stopped too, riding an electric scooter and wearing a driver’s vest. He had one foot on the ground as he picked up a call, telling the person at the other end of the line that he would arrive after another ten minutes or so.</p> <p>Lin Nuan suddenly felt regret. Why didn’t she think of letting Fu Huai’an call a temporary driver?</p> <p>Coming on the trip herself, she would be tortured by the long travel with insufficient time to sleep.</p> <p>She frowned internally but didn’t dare to express it outwardly, her brows furrowing.</p> <p>“Are you used to the new president?” Fu Huai’an spoke suddenly, his deep and thick voice sounding a little hoarse.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was surprised that Fu Huai’an would know what happened to their unit, but after a moment she felt that changing the president and several vice presidents wasn’t a small matter and since it wasn’t a secret, it was normal for Fu Huai’an to know.</p> <p>“The president’s position is high. I don’t have much contact with it… There’s no knowing whether I’m used to it or not.”</p> <p>Although she said that, Lin Nuan felt that with a lady as the new president, the sexual harassment issues towards females in the building should lessen, and it was good news towards the female hosts who detested sleeping their way up.</p>",
  "Chapter 121 - What Anger?": "<p><strong>Chapter 121: What Anger?</strong><br/>\nTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios</p> <p>Looking at Lin Nuan through the rear-view mirror, Fu Huai’an asked calmly, “Are you angry?”</p> <p>Lin Nuan paused at Fu Huai’an’s words—which part of her peaceful tone showed any anger? What anger?</p> <p>She raised her gaze to meet Fu Huai’an’s via the rear-view mirror before dropping it again to look at Tuan Tuan in her arms, saying, “Mr. Fu, you’re overthinking things…”</p> <p>There were few cars on the road at night so it was an easy drive. When they reached Fu Huai’an’s house, Lin Nuan saw that the time on her wristwatch showed that it was 11.30p.m., which was earlier than she had predicted.</p> <p>At the sound of the engine, Auntie Li came out and saw Lin Nuan carrying Tuan Tuan out of the car. She quickly wiped her hands on her apron and jogged to Lin Nuan. She looked at Tuan Tuan and spoke softly, “He’s fallen asleep.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan nodded.</p> <p>After entering the door, Lin Nuan still had to carry the child, so Auntie Li helped her change her shoes while Lin Nuan thanked her in embarrassment.</p> <p>Once she placed Tuan Tuan in his bed upstairs, the little kid started sniffling like he was about to cry once he left her arms so Lin Nuan hurriedly picked up Tuan Tuan and comforted him for a long time.</p> <p>Placing the blanket over Tuan Tuan, Lin Nuan saw from the corner of her eye a black shadow jumping onto the bed and got a shock.</p> <p>Under the dim light of the bedside lamp, Lin Nuan saw a British Shorthair cat sitting on Tuan Tuan’s blanket with its tail curled up. It looked at Lin Nuan in disdain as it elegantly walked beside Tuan Tuan, turning around before it lay down closely beside Tuan Tuan, lazily squinting its eyes.</p> <p>Seeing the cat, Lin Nuan thought of Mushroom.<br/>\nThey’re both British Shorthairs, but once Mushroom saw Lin Nuan it would dive into Lin Nuan’s embrace and cuddle her, using its tail to rub Lin Nuan’s chin.</p> <p>Turning off the light, Lin Nuan left Tuan Tuan’s room and closed the door.</p> <p>She didn’t remember Fu Huai’an’s place having a cat, and Fu Huai’an didn’t seem like someone who would raise a cat.</p> <p>Downstairs, Auntie Li had prepared supper and called Lin Nuan to eat a little, saying, “Mr Fu said the driver will be here in around ten minutes.”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an had already finished his shower and changed his clothes, a cigarette in between his fingers while he sat in the dining room and ate.</p> <p>Lin Nuan didn’t want to eat with him so she dropped her gaze and rejected Auntie Li’s good intentions.</p> <p>“It’s okay, Auntie Li, I’m not used to eating much at night.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan sat in the living room as she waited for the driver, looking through the unread messages on WeChat that had accumulated. Inside was the conversation between her colleagues at the morning news department discussing the new president Chu Qian, including the self-deprecating jokes made by the female colleagues, saying that they could never compare to females such as Chu Qian who were both gorgeous and bold.</p> <p>Seeing someone say that, she wondered if she would catch up to the new president if she ate a few kilograms of boldness. Lin Nuan couldn’t help but laugh.</p> <p>Inside the dining room, Fu Huai’an’s hand paused above the phone screen, his deep gaze looking towards Lin Nuan’s direction.</p> <p>Inside the living room, Lin Nuan sat under the warm light, her hair tied into a low ponytail, looking casual and slightly lazy, and giving off a homey feel. Her fair and soft face held a hint of laughter as she raised her slender arm to tuck her hair behind her ears. Her right arm leaned on the sofa holding her phone, her gaze lowered with a slight smile on her face, giving off a comfortable feeling.</p> <p>Another one of her colleagues sent a message into the group chat but before Lin Nuan could check, her phone vibrated, showing Miss Xia’s name as the Caller ID.</p> <p>For Miss Xia to call at such a late time, could there be any change in tomorrow’s broadcast of morning news?</p> <p>She picked up quickly.</p> <p>“Miss Xia…”</p> <p>“Lin Nuan…” Miss Xia’s tone sounded off.</p>",
  "Chapter 122: You Won’t Be Blamed for Any Issues": "<p>“Yes, it’s me,” Lin Nuan replied.</p> <p>“I have something to trouble you with, but I need you to keep it a strict secret.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan hesitated.</p> <p>“I won’t make it hard on you, I just don’t want other people to know…”</p> <p>“Okay…” Lin Nuan answered.</p> <p>“I’m opening a studio with my friend and we’re going out today to sign the contract. The other party didn’t look at our contract, they just threw a contract at us after we drank a lot and told us to look through it. They’re leaving thirty minutes later and if we agree with the terms, we have to sign it. If we don’t agree it’ll fall through, but the both us are too tipsy and I’m afraid that there will be something wrong with the terms of the contract, I’ll send it to you… Help me look through it, but… you mustn’t tell anyone about me opening a studio, including Bai Xiaonian…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan frowned, saying, “But, Miss Xia… I’m not really familiar with contracts.”</p> <p>“It’s the contract for the theater’s renovation. Don’t hang up, you just have to especially focus on the content I’m repeating to you, you won’t be blamed for any issues!”</p> <p>At the other end of the line, the tipsy Miss Xia said that she would take a photo of the contract and e-mail it to Lin Nuan and that she would call her again later.</p> <p>Lin Nuan hadn’t forgotten that Miss Xia had protected her last time when they had the meal.</p> <p>Lin Nuan was always one who knew how to repay others. Since Miss Xia had called her up and asked her, it would be wrong of Lin Nuan if she kept refusing.</p> <p>Since she did not have her laptop with her, Lin Nuan stood up and walked towards the dining room with her phone in hand, asking Fu Huai’an, “Mr. Fu, may I use your laptop for a moment? It’s urgent…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked up at Lin Nuan and put out the cigarette in his hand, replying, “It’s on the sofa in my bedroom…”</p> <p>“Alright, thank you!”</p> <p>Her phone vibrated, showing that Miss Xia was calling again, saying that she had already e-mailed the contents of the contract to her. Lin Nuan rushed upstairs.</p> <p>Opening the door to Fu Huai’an’s bedroom, Lin Nuan had no time to feel awkward as she quickly opened the laptop on the couch and logged on…</p> <p>Lin Nuan paused, “…”</p> <p>Assuming that Fu Huai’an used his own identification as his laptop’s password was normal…</p> <p>“Miss Xia, please wait a bit…”</p> <p>Lin Nuan hadn’t even finished her sentence when Fu Huai’an entered and walked behind Lin Nuan, supporting his weight with one hand on the back of the sofa as he bent down…</p> <p>She glanced at Fu Huai’an’s masculine features from the corner of her eyes, the two leaning too close together… Lin Nuan subconsciously edged further away to the side.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an looked at Lin Nuan as his long fingers typed out a strand of numbers on the keyboard.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an had showered, the fragrance of his soap mingling with hints of nicotine, the smell invading Lin Nuan’s area of scent, making her heart pick up pace as she fidgeted anxiously.</p> <p>Fu Huai’an just finished entering the password when his phone rang, and he walked towards the balcony to pick up the call.</p> <p>Lin Nuan tried to calm her heart down as she logged on to her own e-mail account.</p> <p>“I’m not sleeping yet…”</p> <p>Fu Huai’an’s voice lacked his usual coldness, replaced by some warmth, making Lin Nuan involuntarily look over at his back as she tried to guess if the person at the other end was Su Manman.</p> <p>Miss Xia’s voice traveled from the phone and Lin Nuan returned to her senses, ignoring the messy thoughts in her head.</p> <p>She had no need to be concerned about whoever was calling Fu Huai’an.</p> <p>“Miss Xia, I’m looking at it right now. Tell me what you want me to look at.”</p> <p>Lin Nuan looked through each line seriously under Miss Xia’s instructions, sometimes reading them out for Miss Xia to hear. The deadline of thirty minutes was strict, so Lin Nuan was extra focused, not even realizing that Fu Huai’an had walked in.</p> <p>Hanging up, Lin Nuan massaged her stiff neck and stretched.</p>"
