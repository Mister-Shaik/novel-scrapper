  "Chapter 1: Taming Beasts with Blood": "<p>“Jade pagodas excavated from an ancient tomb in Miaojiang, don’t miss it!” A tanned, middle-aged man dressed in traditional Miao clothing shouted in front of a bus stop, but he was largely ignored by the crowd.</p> <p>“How much?” Yang Ling had wanted to ignore him, but he saw that the so-called “jade pagodas” were rather exquisite. He involuntarily thought about getting it for his nephew, who had been pestering him for new toys.</p> <p>“It’s not expensive, 280 dollars, it can bless you and your family with good health and smooth careers…”</p> <p>“Five dollars!” Yang Ling loosened the knot on his tie, interrupting the swindler. “Take it or leave it!”</p> <p>Yang Ling had just found his first job since his graduation, and he did not know when his first paycheck would arrive. He was a true member of the “moonlight clan”. Perhaps from tomorrow onward, he would resign himself to five dollar meals from a fast food stand by the road. If he could not afford that, he’d have to eat plain buns with water.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After a bit of haggling, Yang Ling bought the jade pagoda for 10 dollars, but he convinced the man to give him a canvas bag priced at eight dollars for free. He had a relaxed look, while the man from the Miao tribe grumbled. He had not been able to sell these jade pagodas for a few years now, and even garbage collectors found them too heavy to take. He had no choice but to sell them at a very low price.</p> <p>It was the time of evening when everyone was getting off work, and the bus was like a can of sardines. The bus arrived a little late, so even the ladies did not mind squeezing in with the sweaty, smelly men to get home a little earlier.</p> <p>The person in front of Yang Ling was a petite lady wearing a black suit. She had light makeup on, and her lashes were thin and long, but from his angle, he saw that the lashes had been trimmed. Of course, he could also steal glances at her cleavage. It was hot, and the ladies were not wearing much.</p> <p>Some time later, Yang Ling felt the jade pagoda in his hands become hotter. Coincidentally, the tip of the pagoda was resting right on the perky buttocks of the lady in front of him. He did not feel anything at first, but quickly, the suited lady in front of him felt that something was off.</p> <p>With the movement of the bus, the suited lady felt a wave of heat hit her buttocks, as if there was a hard stick propped against her. To make things worse, even after she stepped an inch forward, that stick followed her. It was also becoming hotter. That feeling was like…</p> <p>She turned back to glare at Yang Ling, but saw that he was pretending to be ignorant. The suited lady was as ashamed as she was furious, her face red. She wanted to reprimand Yang Ling, but she didn’t know where to start. She could not put up with this anymore, but she had no space to move away. The thing on her back was becoming hotter and hotter. Her heart began to beat faster as she became more and more ashamed.</p> <p>What if it flows out?</p> <p>The suited lady was uneasy. She felt as though the thing that was prodding her was going to tear the sanitary pad she just put on before she got off work. She was only wearing a thin skirt today. If she bled through the pad, it would definitely leave a large stain. She would be so ashamed.</p> <p>Shame, anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness…</p> <p>The suited lady felt many emotions. Even though the next stop was her destination, she felt that time was dragging by too slowly. The so-called “luxury air-conditioned bus” was moving slower than a snail. The boiling stick behind her made her think about a donkey, an exceptionally large, mutated donkey.</p> <p>“Miss, are you alright?” Yang Ling noticed that the suited lady’s face was red, and that she was frequently looking back at him. He thought that she could not find a handle to grab on and was uncomfortable from squeezing in with the people on board. He said kindly, “If you are feeling uncomfortable, you can come to the back, and I’ll try standing in front of you!”</p> <p>Try standing in front of me?</p> <p>The suited lady nearly fainted. This man is shameless! He’s been rubbing against me throughout the journey, and now he’s saying that he wants to try standing in front of me! How far are perverts on buses willing to go these days?</p> <p>“Ummm…”</p> <p>The bus took a sudden turn, instantly tilting to the left. Under the inertia, the people on the bus leaned into one another. The suited lady felt the thing behind her pierce inward like a shovel against the sponge-like sanitary pad. Blood seeped out.</p> <p>“You pervert. Despicable, shameless, lecherous pervert!” The suited lady felt the thing become hotter and hotter, and she couldn’t stand it anymore. She wanted to whip out a pair of scissors and turn the despicable Yang Ling into a twenty-first century eunuch.</p> <p>Despicable, shameless, lecherous pervert?</p> <p>After the lady’s shouting, even the driver of the bus turned to look out of curiosity, nearly running down a jaywalking old lady.</p> <p>I’m a pervert?</p> <p>Looking at the teary lady, then looking at the jade pagoda that was coincidentally propped against her butt, Yang Ling shook his head. He had just wanted to buy a toy, but now, it had created such a huge spectacle.</p> <p>“Miss, are you talking about this steaming big guy?” Yang Ling lifted the unusually hot jade pagoda under the scrutiny of everyone in the bus.</p> <p>Steaming big guy?</p> <p>After witnessing Yang Ling bring up the jade pagoda from behind the suited woman’s buttocks, the people on the bus understood and broke into laughter. As for the furious suited lady, her face became redder than liver. All she wanted to do was dig a hole for herself to hide in. She jumped off the bus the moment she reached her stop.</p> <p>After successfully clearing his name, Yang Ling was incredibly curious about the hot jade pagoda. He meticulously inspected it on his second-hand computer desk the moment he got home.</p> <p>The jade pagoda was black. Even though it was only the length of a chopstick, it was carved with various images. There were images of Miao people crawling on the ground in prayer, and some were raising their hands and shouting. There were also ferocious wild beasts, including several golden dragons, each one of them lifelike.</p> <p>Other than that, there were streaks of red on the tip of the pagoda, and they smelled like blood. He recalled the ashamed lady and her short skirt, which had been stained with traces of blood. Yang Ling more or less got the idea. His heart shook when he thought about her perky buttocks and her cleavage.</p> <p>Yang Ling curiously ran a cleaver over the jade pagoda, then looked incredulously at it after seeing that there were no scratches.</p> <p>“Tsk tsk, this pagoda is harder than a cleaver. What kind of jade is this made of?” As he was distracted, he accidentally cut his right index finger with the cleaver.</p> <p>“What did that shyster say about blessing me with good health? D*mn, how unlucky!”</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head as he prepared to set the jade pagoda to the side. Unexpectedly, when he touched the jade pagoda with his bloodied right hand, the pagoda released a radiant light. It was absorbing the blood in his body through his wound, and it was stuck to his right hand as if super glued. Even weirder, a violent tornado appeared out of thin air.</p> <p>As he was pulled up into the air, Yang Ling realized in fear that his limbs were rigid. His entire body was numb. Following which, he felt a massive headache and quickly lost consciousness. The landlord who had coincidentally walked past Yang Ling’s house was dumbfounded as he saw a black hole swallow Yang Ling, but not the other things in the house. He passed out in the corridor.</p> <p>In his daze, Yang Ling dreamed a weird dream. He dreamed of an ancient worshipper wandering in a primordial forest. The worshipper had a weird pagoda-shaped brand between his brows.</p> <p>Whenever the worshipper came across a ferocious beast, he would bite the skin of his finger and drip a drop of his blood on the creature to tame it. After that, he could tame the beasts using mere gestures. The gestures became faster and faster, each more mysterious than the last. In the end, he could even control the weather, becoming as powerful as the deities in legends.</p> <p>Some time later, Yang Ling felt a chill as he slowly opened his eyes.</p> <p>There were several clouds in the blue sky. A clear stream meandered through a network of tall trees beside him, and he could hear the cries of frogs nearby. Clearly, this was not the lousy park that demanded a two dollar entry fee near his apartment. It was also not the small hill behind the apartment used for rearing chickens.</p> <p>Yang Ling rubbed his eyes in disbelief as he surveyed the tall trees around him. Even though there were pine trees all around the mountains in his old house, he had never seen pine trees as tall as these. The trunks of these trees were about the size of a truck. He doubted that ten people holding hands would be enough to fully encircle the tree. The roots exposed on the ground were woven like spider webs, each root thicker than his waist.</p> <p>“The primordial forest from Xishuangbanna?” Yang Ling understood that this was not an illusion, nor was it a dream. He pinched his thigh to check.</p> <p>Collecting himself, Yang Ling shook his head and walked cautiously to the clear stream. He had just wanted to wash his face when he suddenly trembled. He saw that a pagoda-shaped mark had appeared between his brows, identical to the one on the worshipper in his dream. After he observed it carefully, he found a faint indication of blood on the tip of the pagoda, as if this pagoda was the one he bought at a discount from the Miao man, the same one that nearly got him labelled as a pervert. This one was just considerably smaller.</p> <p>Am I seeing things?</p> <p>Yang Ling was dumbfounded. He did not understand where the mark of the pagoda had come from, nor did he know how the black-hole-like tornado could have brought him here. He had the faint feeling that everything was due to the so-called jade pagoda excavated from a ten thousand year old Miaojiang tomb.</p> <p>As he could not make sense of anything, Yang Ling opted to wash his face with the clear water of the stream first. After he energized himself, he heard a faint roar. At the same time, he caught the faint scent of blood. He made his way over in curiosity. His scalp crawled immediately when he saw a cluster of thumb-sized mutated bees attacking a rhino-like beast. The bees were taking bites at the giant beast, each bite ripping away chunks of flesh.</p> <p>In immense pain, the rhino manically charged in all directions. It uprooted several tall trees like a bulldozer, but it was unable to flee from the terrifying bees.</p> <p>There was a sharp black horn on the head of every bee. Every time a bee charged downward, the horn was like a blade, gouging a hole in the flesh of the rhino. After that, it would bite down with its sharp teeth and rip off a chunk of flesh. The pain would make the rhino bellow loudly.</p> <p>Without anywhere else to go, the rhino charged straight for the cluster of shrubs Yang Ling was hiding in. Just as he was worried about getting trampled to mush by the rampaging rhino, the bulldozer-like beast thumped onto the ground. It no longer had the strength to get up.</p> <p>Looking over, every hair on Yang Ling’s body stood on end. He saw the bees devour the meat on the rhino’s front legs, leaving behind a large chunk of exposed bone.</p> <p>Yang Ling witnessed a more harrowing scene soon after. The cluster of bees pierced deeply into the body of the rhino and crunching sounds could be heard. Soon after, the massive rhino was picked clean. There was only a puddle of blood left where the rhino was.</p> <p>African man-eating bees?</p> <p>In his shock, Yang Ling sprawled on the ground and slowly retreated backward. He was cautious, fearful that he would catch the attention of the bees. He had retreated several meters and had just started to stand so he could run away when he heard a light snap. He had carelessly broken a thumb-sized branch.</p> <p>“Not good!” Yang Ling was alarmed. He saw a scout bee fly toward him, its sharp teeth clearly visible.</p> <p>Am I going to die here?</p> <p>Yang Ling was suddenly covered in a cold sweat. Even the powerful rhino with thick skin and muscles could not fend off the bees, much less me. I can’t beat it, nor can I run from it. What can I do?</p> <p>At this critical moment, Yang Ling suddenly recalled the actions of the mysterious worshipper in his dreams. He bit on his index finger and pressed it on the head of the bee that was charging over. At that moment, a silver glow escaped the yellow bee. The silver glow formed mysterious symbols, then the bee obediently landed on his arm.</p> <p>Even though it was only a drop of his blood, Yang Ling felt as though the blood in his body had been emptied. He was drained, his head dizzy. At the same time, he felt a wave of heat enter his body. He felt the pagoda-shaped mark between his brows burn. Following which, a foreign memory appeared in his mind.</p> <p>In his daze, Yang Ling felt as though he had arrived at a mysterious space. In front of a tall pagoda, the mutated bee was flying through the air happily. It flew over to Yang Ling excitedly when it saw him.</p> <p>There were two ancient words, Wizard’s Pagoda, carved onto the door of the giant pagoda. The body of the pagoda was filled with various pictures. Some were images of mysterious sacrifices, some fierce beasts, each one of them lifelike. This was especially so for the golden dragons carved near the top of the pagoda. They were incredibly realistic. In fact, one could faintly hear their lightning-like roars.</p> <p>Out of curiosity, Yang Ling lightly pushed on the door of the jade pagoda. Behind him, the tamed bee excitedly followed him in. There was a billowing fog behind the door. He could faintly make out a human-sized stele. There were ancient Chinese characters carved on the stele.</p> <p>“With the primal powers of the Wizard’s Pagoda, absorb the blessings of heaven and earth and grab the essences of the sun and moon…” Yang Ling tried his best to decipher the ancient text on the stele. “With the primal wizarding powers, let blood essences guide you and train your soul…”</p> <p>A long time ago, in order to chase after a belle from the Chinese department, Yang Ling had memorized countless ancient poems. The side effect of that was that he now recognized several ancient Chinese characters. To think that it would prove useful here.</p> <p>There was a passage explaining the text on the bottom, followed by a mysterious mantra. Finally there was an inscription of people in weird poses. Looking over, Yang Ling felt a sense of familiarity, as if these poses were similar to the ones used by the worshipper in his dreams when he was taming beasts.</p> <p>After looking at the stele for some time, Yang Ling more or less got the idea of what was happening. The stele was a record of a mysterious wizarding spell. The spell was split into seven levels, Blood Wizard, Spirit Wizard, Earth Wizard, Heaven Wizard, Divine Wizard, Soul Wizard, and Wizard Deity, respectively. The deeper your wizarding powers, the faster you could tame wild beasts. You could also tame wild beasts of greater numbers and strength. After practice, you could not only tame wild beasts, you could also use their powers and purify their spirits. You could even manipulate the weather just like the worshipper in the dream.</p> <p>After thinking for a moment, Yang Ling realized that he had unintentionally become a beginner Blood Wizard when he got his hands on the Wizard’s Pagoda. Even though he was still a great distance away from the Wizard Deity, he had indeed stepped past the hurdle to practicing wizardry. In so doing, he had not only averted a crisis, he had also used his blood to tame a mutated bee.</p>",
  "Chapter 2: Blood Essence of Magical Beasts": "<p>After repeating the mysterious mantra and actions to himself, Yang Ling felt a wave of giddiness. Slowly, his consciousness wavered.</p> <p>Some time later, Yang Ling opened his eyes to realize that the bee on his arm had disappeared. He recalled the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda and had an idea. He instinctively repeated the mantra. Suddenly, the tamed yellow bee appeared within his field of vision out of thin air.</p> <p>Observing closely, Yang Ling noticed that the tamed bee had grown considerably. Before, it had only been the size of a thumb, but now, it had grown to be as thick as the handle of a sword. Two fangs had grown on both sides of its mouth, reflecting a cold light. The black horn on the top of its head also seemed sharper and exceptionally frightening. It looked like it had benefited much from the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda.</p> <p>After the surprise, Yang Ling thought seriously about the foreign memory that appeared in his mind. He saw a grain-sized bee emerging from its cocoon, then the memory transitioned into a mature bee flying freely in the forest…</p> <p>It looks like I’ve not only tamed the bee in front of me, I’ve also gained its memories.</p> <p>The bee he had tamed was a low level Magical Beast called the Horned Bee Beast. Through its memories, Yang Ling found out that he had arrived at a place called the Terras Forest which spanned ten thousand miles. There were not many humans here, and Magical Beasts roamed this land. There might be many powerful entities deep within the forest, as even the Horned Bee Beast before him did not dare enter.</p> <p>Crossing through space-time?</p> <p>Yang Ling let out a bitter laugh after he realized that he had been brought to this foreign world for reasons unknown. He had never expected that he would have to deal with such an unthinkable situation one day.</p> <p>Live on. Only by stubbornly living on in this world where the strong preyed on the weak could he find a way home!</p> <p>After the initial shock, Yang Ling slowly calmed down. There were no televisions here, nor was there the internet, but there were countless terrifying Magical Beasts. If he wanted to return to the world he was familiar with, he had to find a way to survive. If he gave up on himself, he might end up in the belly of some Magical Beast in the blink of an eye, much less return home.</p> <p>A foreign world, a vast primordial forest, terrifying Magical Beasts, also the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda and mantra…</p> <p>Yang Ling stroked the sharp black horn of the Horned Bee Beast. He was worried, but he was also excited. Perhaps this foreign continent would give him larger surprises.</p> <p>After experimenting a little, he quickly discovered the technique of controlling the Horned Bee Beast. After he practiced the technique, he was able to make the tamed Horned Bee Beast follow his commands. His control over the bee was the same as the control he had over his fingers. At the same time, whatever the Horned Bee Beast saw or thought would quickly enter his mind. That feeling was strange, yet wonderful, as if he was equipped with a 3D camera.</p> <p>The teeth of the Horned Bee Beast were incredibly sharp. They could shatter even solid rock with a bite, much less the bones of a wild beast. The bee had many sources of food, from decomposing corpses, to white ants, to even the steel-like minerals on the ground.</p> <p>After witnessing the fate of the rhino, Yang Ling had wanted to stay far away from the Horned Bee Beasts. But ever since the Horned Bee Beast he tamed bit a wild rabbit to death and gave him a food source without him doing anything, he started to have a bold idea. Even though the Horned Bee Beast was terrifying, it was an excellent assistant after it had been tamed.</p> <p>This forest was mysterious, or should he say that the wild beasts here were insane.</p> <p>Sometimes, an innocent looking wild rabbit could spew a ball of fire out of its mouth. Sometimes, a fish in the water could expel an arrow made of water, sharper than any Swiss army knife and more powerful than an ox. Without enough power, Yang Ling understood that there was no way he could make his way out of this foreign, mysterious primordial forest.</p> <p>With the guidance of the tamed Horned Bee Beast, Yang Ling carefully made his way to the nest of the Horned Bee Beasts. He hid in a nearby bush, motionless, in search of any Horned Bee Beasts that had strayed from the group.</p> <p>The nest of the Horned Bee Beasts was constructed on a granite wall covered with weeds. The wall was littered with thigh-sized holes. From afar, it looked like a giant beehive.</p> <p>Groups of Horned Bee Beasts entered and exited the nest continually, some carrying the meat of a wild beast, some carrying thumb-sized sticks. There were even several bees working together, dragging a still-twitching wild rabbit into the nest. Other than that, there were a number of larger Horned Bee Beasts flying around, patrolling the nest.</p> <p>Not far away, a group of Horned Bee Beasts were slamming into a giant pine tree. After circling the tree twice, the bees would descend upon the tree, piercing into its bark with their sharp horns. They would immediately rise back into the air, then rain down once again, completing the cycle. Every time they collided with the tree, the large tree would let out a thump, as if the bees were forcefully hitting a wall.</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was feeling perplexed, an opening finally appeared in the trunk of the tree following the collision of the many Horned Bee Beasts. After which, white ants the size of chopsticks scuttled out of the opening, some of them following the trunk upward, the rest falling like rain onto the ground.</p> <p>After letting out excited cries, the Horned Bee Beasts welled forward, swallowing the soft white ants in gulps. Quickly, the stomachs of the Horned Bee Beasts swelled like balloons. Soon after, there were no more white ants left.</p> <p>Yang Ling waited patiently. He saw a full grown Horned Bee Beast lazily flying around. With a thought, he commanded the tamed Horned Bee Beast to fly outward to attract his prey over to him.</p> <p>After the tamed Horned Bee Beast collided with it, the lazy wild Horned Bee Beast was agitated. It manically chased after the tamed beast. Just as it was flying over a bush, a drop of blood suddenly fell onto its head. Instantly, silver light glowed around it as mysterious symbols appeared.</p> <p>After he succeeded, Yang Ling retreated carefully with his two Horned Bee Beasts. His wizarding abilities were not strong, and he could only tame one Horned Bee Beast at a time. If the large group of wild Horned Bee Beasts noticed his actions, then his life would be forfeit.</p> <p>Cautiously, Yang Ling retreated far away. Unexpectedly, he had just thought about lying down and resting when the Horned Bee Beast beside him suddenly raised its tail nervously. This was followed by the ghostly howl of a wolf not far away. Nervously, he carefully crept over, only to see a giant wolf, the size of a young cow, grappling with a black and white python.</p> <p>The wild wolf was black, and its rows of sharp teeth reflected cold light. Yang Ling had no doubt that it could smash his thigh bone with a mere bite. The python was even more terrifying. It was as thick as a water pail. It flicked its tongue quickly, its lantern-like eyes staring straight at the wild wolf.</p> <p>After a couple seconds of the motionless standoff, the hungry-looking wild wolf took the offensive. It let out a howl before spewing a ball of dark red fire from its mouth. The coiled up python was unwilling to display weakness. It extinguished the flames with an arrow of water, then struck toward the wolf.</p> <p>A wild wolf that could spew fire, a python that could spew water? Yang Ling was dumbfounded as he rubbed his eyes. He suspected that this was a dream.</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was dazed, the wild wolf took a bite at the python. The python wrapped tightly around the calf-sized wolf. The two parties howled incessantly, each releasing every ounce of their strength.</p> <p>After a frightening battle, the spine of the wild wolf was shattered. Its pupils dilated, its strength waning as it struggled; the python was not in a good state either. It had traces of blood all over its body, especially where the wolf had bitten it. The blood did not stop flowing as the wolf’s howls became weaker.</p> <p>Yang Ling’s face was pale after using his blood essence to tame the Horned Bee Beasts. He was famished. Seeing the damage suffered by both parties following the battle, Yang Ling had an idea. He sent his two Horned Bee Beasts forward. The mutated Horned Bee Beasts made quick work of the struggling python.</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged beside the wild wolf, Yang Ling recited the mysterious mantra and pressed his right hand on the head of the wolf. Quickly, the flesh of the wild wolf shriveled, and a mist of air spouted from all around its body. Slowly, a peanut-sized orb of blood crystallized on Yang Ling’s palm.</p> <p>So this is the Blood Crystallization Technique, a secret technique of Blood Wizards, which enables them to refine the essences of all the beasts in the world?</p> <p>Looking at the orb of blood in his palm, Yang Ling hesitated for a moment before swallowing it. According to the explanation on the stele, this blood orb refined from the essence of a wild beast had many mysteries, and it was the most powerful supporting item needed for a Blood Wizard to advance. It could rapidly increase his wizarding abilities.</p> <p>“Well, that feels incredible!” After successfully absorbing the power of the orb of blood, Yang Ling slowly opened his eyes. The mountain looked greener and the sky bluer, and he could clearly feel the movement of everything within a ten-step radius.</p> <p>Yang Ling stood up and tested his movements. He felt that his body was filled with energy. He felt as though he could punch a hole in a tree. It looks like the mysterious mantra was powerful indeed. It could not only tame wild beasts, but it could also allow him to absorb their powers through the Blood Crystallization Technique.</p> <p>After understanding how he could use the wizarding techniques, Yang Ling was filled with hope about walking out of this foreign, dangerous forest. He had decided to accept the fact that he had been transported to this world. Perhaps he would be able to enjoy a unique life after strangely arriving at this foreign world.</p>",
  "Chapter 3: Taming an Army": "<p>Hiding atop a tree with lush leaves, Yang Ling lay motionless as he watched a small team of Horned Bee Beasts searching for food. Beside him, thirty-six tamed Horned Bee Beasts silently unfolded their black wings. Their sharp fangs reflected cold light. They lifted their tails, ready to strike, just waiting for the order to attack.</p> <p>After consuming the blood essences of the giant wolf and the python, he noticed in surprise that his wizard abilities had greatly improved. He now could tame ten Horned Bee Beasts with his blood a day, so his efficiency was much greater than it had been in the past. In just a few days, he had successfully tamed dozens of Horned Bee Beasts.</p> <p>Because of either Yang Ling’s blood essence or the effects of the Wizard’s Pagoda, the thumb-sized Horned Bee Beasts would grow to become the size of a sword hilt after being stored for some time in the Wizard’s Pagoda. At the same time, the fang would grow from each side of their mouths, the horns on their heads would also become sharper, and their battle abilities would become even greater than Horned Bee Beasts in the wild.</p> <p>Yang Ling had tried it several times, noticing that the Horned Bee Beasts that he tamed were more aggressive than the ones in the wild. When faced with their wild counterparts, they could deal with five to six of them at the same time.</p> <p>The team of Horned Bee Beasts that came out in search of food had a messy formation. There were about a hundred of them, each slowly flying between the trees in search of food. Some of them flipped over dried branches to see if there were any ants or bugs, others foraged for leaves and sucked on the liquids within, and there were some whizzing around pine trees, searching for the nests of white ants.</p> <p>Seeing the Horned Bee Beasts in search of food becoming more scattered, Yang Ling seized the opportunity and split his thirty-six tamed Horned Bee Beasts into six groups, six bees per group. Other than leaving one group as his bodyguards, he ordered the rest of the Horned Bee Beasts to attack immediately. They were to launch a sneak attack on their unsuspecting counterparts.</p> <p>With Yang Ling’s command, thirty ferocious Horned Bee Beasts flew out like lightning. Their first strike succeeded, and they changed targets as soon as they rendered their wild counterparts immobile. At the same time, Yang Ling followed behind quickly. He bit on his index finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the head of each wild Horned Bee Beast.</p> <p>Over these few days, he accidentally discovered that it was easier to tame injured Horned Bee Beasts. The heavier the injury, the less wizard abilities and blood essence he had to use when taming them. With his current wizard abilities, he could only tame ten healthy Horned Bee Beasts in a day, but after the Horned Bee Beasts were injured, he could tame dozens of them without a problem.</p> <p>At the same time, he realized that no mattered how injured the Magical Beasts were, they could recover fully after being stored in the Wizard’s Pagoda, as if the thick fog within the Wizard’s Pagoda had healing abilities. But this was only limited to Magical Beasts that had just been tamed. After tamed Magical Beasts were injured, they recovered much more slowly. It was as if one was consuming flu medicine; the initial effects would be great, but any subsequent medicine would have diminished effects.</p> <p>With the sudden onslaught, the wild Horned Bee Beasts could not react before they became severely injured. A few of them managed to fight back, but they were powerless against the tamed Horned Bee Beasts. They were either bit in two by the powerful jaws or stung by the sharp black horn.</p> <p>At Yang Ling’s commands, the wild Horned Bee Beasts were wiped out soon after. Other than the thirty or so beasts that had lost their wings or been stung into mush, the rest of them were successfully tamed by Yang Ling and brought into the Wizard’s Pagoda for recovery.</p> <p>Yang Ling was pale after exhausting a large amount of wizard abilities and blood essence. He heaved a sigh as he quickly left, just in case a large group of wild Horned Bee Beasts noticed his actions. After he retreated far away, he commanded the tamed Horned Bee Beasts to hunt. This way, he could not only enjoy some wild game for dinner, he could also train the cooperation and battle abilities of the Horned Bee Beasts. Occasionally, the bees would also successfully kill a low level Magical Beast for him to feast on its blood essence.</p> <p>And that was his routine. When he became tired, Yang Ling would instruct the Horned Bee Beasts to hunt, and then he would consume the crystallized blood essence of their prey. After he recovered his energy, he would seek out more Horned Bee Beasts. At night, he would seize the opportunity to practice the mysterious wizard mantra. In the beginning, the wizard powers circulating in his body were faint, but after some time, he could gradually feel a roaring current.</p> <p>A month or so later, Yang Ling gradually adapted to the jungle. He had tamed more than two thousand Horned Bee Beasts, and he gradually stopped frequenting the hive of the Horned Bee Beasts.</p> <p>It was not that he wanted to accumulate good karma, but that the Horned Bee Beasts had become more cautious. There were not many small teams of Horned Bee Beasts flying around anymore, much less individual bees. The rest of the Horned Bee Beasts either stayed in their nest or swarmed out in armies. There was no way for him to strike anymore.</p> <p>After obtaining a sufficient defensive ability, Yang Ling started to make his way to the outer circles of the forest. He wanted to someday make his way out of this ten thousand mile wide Terras Forest. He sent many Horned Bee Beasts out as scouts on his journey and avoided Magical Beasts he could not defeat. When he occasionally saw a wild beast that he could easily defeat, he would command his Horned Bee Beasts to launch multiple attacks.</p> <p>This day, after journeying for several hours, Yang Ling stopped by a small lake. He wanted to take a quick rest before continuing on his journey. According to the memories of the Horned Bee Beasts, he would be able to make his way out of the primordial Terras Forest if he walked westward.</p> <p>A group of small white rabbits were playing near the lake, their lychee-sized eyes scanning Yang Ling. But Yang Ling had lost interest in them. After all, no matter how delicious their meat was, one could only eat so much of it before getting tired of it. This was the same logic that would explain why a man would cheat despite having married a pretty wife.</p> <p>“Kill…”</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was about to squat and wash his face, he heard the sounds of a massacre coming from far away. As low level Magical Beasts, Horned Bee Beasts could use simple, local language. After receiving their memories, Yang Ling had quickly learned this relatively simple language.</p> <p>After silently arriving at the scene, Yang Ling hid in the top of a tree with thick leaves. Not far away was a small mountain village. A group of warriors dressed in black clothes were riding flying beasts, manically attacking a group of flustered elves with sharp ears.</p> <p>The warriors in black were riding two different kinds of flying beast. Other than a few calf-sized gryphons, the rest were riding black and white condors.</p> <p>According to the memories of the Horned Bee Beasts, the condors had considerable speed, but they lacked offensive capabilities and were low level flying Magical Beasts. Gryphons, on the other hand, were terrifying. They were not only speedy, but they also had immense power. The elves would be crushed into a mush with just a pounce.</p> <p>With their powerful charging capabilities, the warriors in black roared as they lifted their bloody battle blades. At the same time, an elder elf leading the resistance gave a signal, and the elves launched arrows at the warriors. Every flying green arrow brought down a warrior in black. The lightning-like speed and terrifying accuracy caught the warriors in black off guard. The victors of the battle seemed to be undecided.</p> <p>A battle between races?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head. He released all two thousand of his bloodthirsty Horned Bee Beasts. Save for a hundred that he sent to scout the surroundings, he kept the rest of them around him, just in case of a sudden attack.</p> <p>Suddenly, Yang Ling had a glint in his eyes. He saw a black-haired teen elf girl come out from behind the elder. She was slender, her hair long and flowy. Her white dress accentuated her beauty.</p> <p>After muttering for a moment with a green staff in her hand, she released a dark halo from her palm. Everywhere the dark halo passed, the black warriors’ movements became sluggish, as if they were under a curse. It was as if they were swimming in super glue. They were picked off by the accurate arrows of the elves.</p> <p>“Quick, capture that elf priest!” A young man that looked like the leader issued an angry command after losing a few warriors. Quickly, a group of elite warriors in black charged swiftly toward the beautiful lady.</p> <p>Seeing the warriors in black charge toward her with bloodlust, the long-haired lady nervously took several steps back. She once again chanted as she held her dark green staff. Quickly, a ripple appeared in the air, and following that came the sounds of wood cracking. The tall trees around them had become Withered Tree Giants, several meters tall.</p> <p>Under the command of the long-haired beauty, the Withered Tree Giants advanced toward the warriors in black with heavy steps. They swung hard with their bathtub sized clubs, crushing the warriors in black into mush along with their rides.</p> <p>Demonic arts, illusions?</p> <p>Yang Ling rubbed his eyes, unable to believe that he had just seen tall trees become Withered Tree Giants.</p>",
  "Chapter 4: Withered Tree Guardians": "<p>The Withered Tree Giants had brown skin etched with intersecting lines, similar to the tree rings on wood. Their chest muscles were made up of sections. From far away, they looked like walls of hard granite.</p> <p>There were thorns on their knees and elbows. Even though they were shorter than daggers, they were incredibly sharp. Yang Ling had no doubt that they could easily pierce through a person’s skull.</p> <p>The weapon held by each Withered Tree Giant was suffocatingly massive. Rather than call it a giant mace, it was more like a giant log of primordial wood, even thicker than the pillars used to support Yang Ling’s old apartment. Yang Ling was sure that even a T92 tank would be pulverized if it met the impact of those clubs.</p> <p>Shocking, this is too shocking!</p> <p>Yang Ling was dumbfounded. The warriors in black were even more fearful. The Withered Tree Guardians were the guardian deities of the elves of the forest. They were tall and immensely powerful. Even though they knew that they might have to face off against such terrifying entities, the warriors in black had not expected that the long-haired beauty would be able to summon a whole twenty-five of them at the same time.</p> <p>Under the commands of the long-haired beauty, the Withered Tree Guardians took large strides toward the warriors in black. With every step, they brought up large amounts of soil. Even though they were slow, they covered nearly ten meters with every step. In the blink of an eye, they had arrived directly in front of the warriors in black.</p> <p>They brought down their clubs, the impact as loud as lightning. They smashed the warriors in black who could not avoid the attacks in time into pulp, blood splattering everywhere.</p> <p>Caught off guard and facing the massive Withered Tree Guardians, the warriors in black frantically whipped their condors and gryphons and took to the air. The Withered Tree Guardians before them did not advance, but the hardy bodies of these entities were not something the swordsmen could deal with. Only the spellcasters that followed them into battle would be able to deal much damage to the guardian deities of the elves.</p> <p>Under the cover of the Withered Tree Guardians, the elves retaliated. Their dark green arrows rained down on the warriors in black, turning them into porcupines. The morale of the warriors was smashed in an instant.</p> <p>Unable to take to the skies in time, some of the warriors in black fearfully steered their flying beasts to the side. But quickly, they realized that their actions were all for naught. They were either reduced to porcupines by the arrows of the elves or smashed like flies by the clubs of the Withered Tree Guardians. After that, a bulldozer-like foot would crush down, turning them into thin pancakes. Yang Ling had chills just witnessing the scene.</p> <p>According to the Horned Bee Beasts he sent out to scout the surroundings, there were no ambushes set by either party. This put Yang Ling more at ease. He did not want to risk losing his life to witness the action. This world was too crazy; rabbits could spew fire, pythons could spew water, and now even a tree could turn into a spirit. Who knew what other monsters he would come across next.</p> <p>“Wind Riding Technique, quick!” Seeing how invincible the Withered Tree Guardians were, the fearful young man ordered loudly. “All spellcasters are to take steps backward and support the warriors using the Wind Riding Technique, quick!”</p> <p>After the heavy loss, the morale of the young man on the gryphon was low. He stared at the long-haired beauty holding the dark green staff on the ground and clenched his teeth in hatred. According to the intelligence he got from his soldiers, there was only a small elf tribe here. He had thought that he could easily defeat them. He did not expect to face off against this many Withered Tree Guardians.</p> <p>“Yiblis, I’ll sell you to the lowliest brothel after I am done with you. I’ll make sure you satisfy eighty barbarians everyday, d*mn it!” The young man cursed in hatred. Only by selling these young beautiful elves to the nobles or brothels can I recover the loss incurred by this attack. Otherwise, I will have lost big.</p> <p>After receiving the order, several spellcasters dressed in long robes took to the skies on the gryphons. They stopped after they confirmed that they were out of range of the elves’ arrows, then started casting the Wind Riding Technique on the warriors in black. In that instant, the warriors in black sped up. They could now easily avoid the slow Withered Tree Guardians. They charged with bloodlust toward the elves.</p> <p>The condors and gryphons were naturally fast, but they reached alarming speeds after the Wind Riding Technique. Some of the elves were caught off guard, their throats slit by the descending warriors in black. Some of them had even poorer fates, torn in half by the calf-sized gryphons. Blood, brain matter, and intestines slopped onto the ground.</p> <p>Seeing the bloodthirsty warriors in black, the long-haired beauty commanded the Withered Tree Guardians to engage them in combat. Unfortunately, the warriors were too fast to catch. Often, the warriors in black would have already left the attack range of the Withered Tree Guardians before they had finished lifting their clubs. It was like trying to fish with a basket; the basket was too slow, and the fish were too quick.</p> <p>“Sofia, gather the Withered Tree Guardians, quickly!” Seeing the speedy warriors in black, the elder commanding the elves had an idea. Since the Withered Tree Guardians were ineffective and were unable to catch up to the opponents, it was better to gather them and focus on their defense.</p> <p>Indeed, the tide of the battle changed once again when the twenty-five guardians were gathered together. The warriors in black did not dare swoop down and attack, fearful of the thick, long clubs of the guardians. The elves could hide behind the Withered Tree Guardians and shoot their arrows, accurately taking down several warriors in black.</p> <p>“Ice Frost Technique, freeze the Withered Tree Guardians!” the young man ordered after circling the air. Following the command, the several spellcasters started to chant. Quickly, the temperature of the surroundings dropped. Even Yang Ling, who was hiding in the treetops, could not help but shiver.</p> <p>After hearing the incantations of the spellcasters and noticing the increasing magic power in the air, the color drained from the face of the elf elder. The Withered Tree Guardians had not advanced and could not attack the targets in the air. If they became frozen and unable to attack the targets on the ground, the outcome would be disastrous.</p> <p>“Elder, we have to ensure the continuity of our clan: lead the clansmen in retreat. It will be too late if we don’t leave now!”</p> <p>After clenching his teeth, an elf warrior with a full holster of arrows stepped forward. But without waiting for the elder to give an order, the spellcasters in the air raised their right hands at the same time. Swan feathers descended from the sky like snow. In the blink of an eye, the slow Withered Tree Guardians were frozen solid.</p> <p>Ice sculptures? Really?</p> <p>Shivering, Yang Ling once again calmed the Horned Bee Beasts, excited by the smell of blood. He circulated the wizard powers in his body to ward off the cold. Admiring ice sculptures was a recreational activity, but being turned into a living ice sculpture was another story.</p> <p>Seeing that the Withered Tree Guardians were now unable to move, the morale of the warriors in black ran high. They frantically charged toward the elves.</p> <p>“Haha, you’re asking for death!” The young man slit the throat of an elf warrior and gave a loud order, “Kill all the men and take all their possessions. Tie up all of the women!”</p> <p>The young man was heavily armored, his gaze sinister. He charged downward riding his gryphon, under the protection of many guards. After scattering the elves’ formation, he charged straight for the long-haired beauty.</p> <p>“D*mn it, don’t kill the young elf ladies! They are all money. Tie them all up.” The young man reprimanded a warrior who was enjoying the massacre. He looked lecherously at the bodies of the young elf ladies. “Haha, warriors, enjoy this day with me, Ymir!”</p> <p>After understanding the intentions of the young man, the warriors in black let out loud howls, advancing even faster toward the retreating elves. Some of them even became savages, immediately tearing off the clothes of the elf ladies.</p> <p>“Release me you beasts, release me!”</p> <p>The long-haired beauty struggled after she got tied up by several warriors in black. Seeing her grandfather unable to help, and then looking at the young man advancing toward her lecherously, she could not help but cry.</p> <p>“Haha, beauty, I am coming for you!” Ymir could not control his urges when he saw this fairy-like lady. He could not wait and pounced forward. “Oh my little beauty, you need not worry, I’ll treat you well!”</p> <p>“Ah… my eyes!”</p> <p>“Ah, Horned Bee Beasts, help!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Just as the long-haired beauty closed her eyes in despair, the warriors in black beside her suddenly started shouting hysterically. Blood was flowing out their eyes. They dropped onto the ground and started rolling around. She opened her eyes and looked, only to see many Horned Bee Beasts savagely biting the eyes and heads of the warriors in black.</p> <p>In the critical moment, Yang Ling had sent out his Magical Beast army that was excited by the smell of blood.</p>",
  "Chapter 5: Chapter 5": "<p>Seeing Ymir ordering his men to tie up the females of the elf tribe, Yang Ling guessed that this man was either a slave master, or at the very least, a slave trafficker. He was capable of committing any evil. After confirming that there were no ambushes around them, he decided to show off some of his power!</p> <p>He had to tackle the problem at the source. If he was to act, he was going to use all of his power to target the leader.</p> <p>Yang Ling gathered two hundred of the fiercest Horned Beast Bees and split them into two teams. He ordered one of the teams to attack the young man Ymir, while the other team was sent to deal with the spellcasters in the air. He did not want the mysterious spellcasters to turn him into a human popsicle after he exposed himself.</p> <p>The army of Horned Bee Beasts became increasingly excited as they heard the pathetic cries and detected the thick scent of blood following the ambush. If not for Yang Ling’s commands and suppression, they might have swarmed over in that instant.</p> <p>After being tamed by Yang Ling, the Horned Bee Beasts not only became more powerful, they also became more raring to battle. Sometimes, after they captured their prey, they not only swallowed their bones, they even consumed the fresh blood splattered onto the ground. At the same time, just like Yang Ling, the beasts would experience considerable improvements after consuming the blood essence of Magical Beasts. Their armor would become more sturdy, the black horns on their heads sharper, and they became even faster.</p> <p>Caught off guard, the warriors in black stood no chance against the ferocious Horned Bee Beasts. Some of them fled outward in a fluster, but they were shot down by the elf warriors. Some flailed their swords in vain and could only watch as the Horned Bee Beasts ripped their flesh, turning them into bare skeletons in mere seconds.</p> <p>Wherever the Horned Bee Beasts went, the once-victorious warriors in black abandoned their armor and fled. Even the mighty gryphons were no exception, fleeing immediately. The lucky managed to flee, while the unlucky were reduced to bones, some even leaving behind only a few strands of hair or a pool of blood.</p> <p>Ymir, who was the primary target of the Horned Bee Beasts’ attacks, was in an even more pathetic state. Several of his elite guards were instantly reduced to pools of blood. Ymir was incredibly afraid, seeing the sharp fangs of the Horned Bee Beasts and hearing the blood-curdling screams of his guards.</p> <p>“Ah, my butt!” In his fear, Ymir maintained his guard on his eyes and vital areas, but a large portion of flesh was ripped from his butt. “D*mn it, cut through this formation! Gilbas, Fireball Technique!”</p> <p>In his panic, Ymir shot a fireball toward his butt. At the same time as he was burning the detestable Horned Bee Beasts, the flames seared his buttocks. The pain made him sweat and tear up.</p> <p>The spellcaster called Gilbas had fast reactions, but the Horned Bee Beasts suddenly changed the focus of their attacks, targeting the scattered warriors in black instead. He had not killed many Horned Bee Beasts despite launching a large number of fireballs. Instead, ten more warriors in black were sprawled on the ground, burned and smoking. Ymir was furious. If not for the pain in his butt and his limited movement, he would have charged over to Gilbas and slapped the sh*t out of him.</p> <p>“D*mn it, reform on me. Make your way to me even if it means you have to die!”</p> <p>Seeing the increasing numbers of the Horned Bee Beasts, Ymir became even paler as he gave a loud order. Horned Bee Beasts were low level Magical Beasts. Even though their individual offensive capabilities were not terrifying, a large group of them would be tricky. One would not be able to deal with this large of a group of flying beasts unless one was equipped with sturdy armor or ample spellcasting abilities.</p> <p>Under such a terrible situation, the warriors in black fled in all directions like headless cockroaches. Some of them, in their terror, even rolled off their flying beasts that were hovering in the air. At the same time, the condors and gryphons that had lost their masters also fled for their lives, as mighty as they were. A calf-sized gryphon, in its panic, flew straight toward where Yang Ling was hiding.</p> <p>“Haha, great!” Yang Ling was not afraid when he saw the gryphon charging toward him. Instead, he was elated. With a speedy gryphon as his ride, it would be much easier to make it out of this large forest.</p> <p>Yang Ling quickly jumped out of the treetops and grabbed onto the right claw of the gryphon before pulling himself up onto its back. He then bit his index finger and dripped a drop of blood onto its head. In that moment, a silver glow surrounded the gryphon, forming into several mysterious symbols. The tamed gryphon obediently allowed Yang Ling to ride it.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, Yang Ling instructed the gryphon to stop on top of a giant stone. When he had tamed the gryphon just now, he felt as though his blood and wizard powers had poured out. He became fatigued in an instant. It looked like the level of this gryphon was much higher than a Horned Bee Beast. If not for the fact that it was not in the mood for a battle now, it might have trampled him with a simple charge. There might not have been enough time for him to tame it with his blood.</p> <p>“Ah, help!”</p> <p>“Ah, my thigh…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Even though the warriors in black were nimble, there were unfortunately too many Horned Bee Beasts to deal with. They were unable to gather before a swarm of Horned Bee Beasts attacked them, reducing them into piles of bones in the blink of an eye. Some of their bones were even picked clean. The pathetic cries before their deaths were chilling.</p> <p>Seeing the swarms of Horned Bee Beasts and hearing the crunching sounds of bones, even the elves who were not the targets of the attacks were fearful, much less the warriors in black.</p> <p>“A summoner? Yiblis, we fell for the ambush of the elves of the forest!” Ymir understood after he saw that the attacks of the Horned Bee Beasts had been coordinated and focused only on the warriors. Then he saw Yang Ling, who charged out under the protection of a team of Horned Bee Beasts.</p> <p>Horned Bee Beasts were Magical Beasts of the lowest level and did not have high intelligence. Usually, they would all swarm forward when they encountered an enemy or prey. But the attacks of the Horned Bee Beasts before them were strategic, precise, and clearly trained. They must have been trained and controlled by a Summoner like Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Retreat, quickly!” Ymir ordered after a moment’s hesitation. He realized that he had lost the battle after seeing the casualties, and that even a few spellcasters were unable to fend for themselves. He was the first to hop onto a gryphon and flee for his life.</p> <p>“Ah, my butt, ah…”</p> <p>In the chaos, Ymir sat on his gryphon. He howled in pain whenever the bleeding wound on his butt came into contact with the hard bones of the gryphon. But there was a swarm of Horned Bee Beasts behind him. To save himself, he had no choice but to bear with the pain and flee on the gryphon.</p> <p>“D*mn you elves and that blasted Summoner. Wait and see, I’ll be back!”</p> <p>Ymir was furious as he looked at the few warriors beside him. He had not expected to be left with such a small group of men despite him personally leading the attack. He had not only failed to capture a single forest elf, he had paid a heavy price.</p>",
  "Chapter 6: Evolution": "<p>“Sir, here please!”</p> <p>After reversing the battle, Yang Ling received the passionate hospitality of the elves. He was invited into a green wooden building. The ground was level in the building and etched with natural patterns, its texture similar to white marble. The ground did not produce a sound wherever Yang Ling stepped. It was as if he was walking on soft, noise-absorbing wooden planks.</p> <p>“Sir, please try this rum we made using the purple orchids, scutellaria, and morning dew we gathered.” The long-haired beauty Sofia took several steps back, leaving behind a faint fragrance, after serving Yang Ling a cup of light green rum. She beckoned for the elf elder to sit.</p> <p>“From your accent, sir, you don’t seem to be local?”</p> <p>“Elder, you can just call me Yang Ling.” Yang Ling took a sip of the light green rum. It was refreshing, as if it was filled with pure mint. “You are right, my hometown is somewhere far away from here. I heard the sounds of a battle when I was passing through just now and thus hurried over to help.”</p> <p>Yang Ling drank more of the rum as he silently observed his surroundings. Since he was a foreigner, he thought that he might have unexpected gains after he befriended the local elves.</p> <p>“The slave-capturing squads of the humans are becoming more and more brazen, especially the violent ones they sent today!” The elf elder had a serious expression. He gripped the pitch black staff in his hand tightly. “It is fortunate that you came at the right time and provided assistance, Yang Ling. Otherwise, the outcome would have been disastrous!”</p> <p>“It was nothing, you need not thank me,” Yang Ling said in relief. “The attackers suffered heavy casualties, so I would think that they will not dare bother you in the future. Your lives should improve!”</p> <p>“No, the nightmares have just begun. The young man that escaped is from the notorious Anca family from Wissen Town. After the heavy casualties this time around, he might soon return with a large group of warriors for revenge!”</p> <p>The elf elder had a depressed tone. He became increasingly worried as he thought about the powerful Anca family. This area was far away from the other elf tribes. They did not have Dalewi Warriors or elite hunters, much less powerful forces such as the Fairy Dragon or the Twin-headed Chimera.</p> <p>It would be best for them to retreat as soon as possible when faced with the vengeance of the Anca family, but winter was approaching. There was no way they could migrate with their entire tribe. The only method they had left was to think of ways to keep this mysterious Summoner here.</p> <p>Yang Ling got the general idea after hearing the elf elder’s explanation. It turned out that the Tailun Continent that they were in now was immensely vast, and the Terras Forest was the largest primordial forest in the Tailun Continent.</p> <p>Since there were rich resources in these parts, the Terras Forest had attracted many humans to gather wood and hunt. Slowly, near an ancient castle in the outer parts of the forest, a small town called Wissen was established.</p> <p>The town was not big by any means, its population only about twenty thousand. But since it was near a place with many resources, the number of troops, risk takers, and merchants that were stationed there often numbered four to five thousand.</p> <p>The Anca family was the most powerful faction in Wissen Town. They had warriors in the family that could kill without blinking an eye. It was rumored that they also had many powerful swordsmen and spellcasters. They were notorious for extorting the citizens and merchants, as well as for their slave trade.</p> <p>Over the years, many troops of considerable abilities came into conflict with the Anca family, but no one had ever bested them. Most of the troops that stood up against them ended up dismembered. There were no exceptions over the past years.</p> <p>It was rumored that the Anca family were a group of merciless pirates, and that Wissen Town was merely a small resting spot for them. Often, people would see warriors of unknown origins enter their castle. These warriors were all merciless characters.</p> <p>Slowly, troops and adventurers from all over the world fell under the control of the Anca family, much less the inhabitants of the town. Even small tribes of other races living in Terras Forest were often harassed by these human traffickers.</p> <p>After giving Yang Ling a rough explanation of the situation, the elf elder let out a heavy sigh. According to the rumors that had spread over the years, the elves’ situation wasn’t optimistic now that they had become a target of the powerful Anca family.</p> <p>After groaning for a moment, the elf elder had an idea. He said sincerely, “Brave warrior Yang Ling, I wonder if it’s convenient for you to stay here for a short time?”</p> <p>“I’m sorry, I have already arranged to meet a friend a few days later…” Even though Yang Ling wanted to stay, he feigned hesitation. “Furthermore, my Horned Bee Beasts are still rather weak. If the opponents launched a strong offensive, I might not be of any help!”</p> <p>When he understood the elf elder’s intentions, Yang Ling decided to play hard to get. He might obtain a bigger reward that way. But it would be troublesome if Ymir led a large group of warriors and spellcasters here to exact revenge.</p> <p>This continent was strange and mysterious. A Fireball Technique was enough to burn more than ten Horned Bee Beasts to ash. If the other party were to mobilize even more powerful spellcasters, he might be defeated in an instant.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, these are all Magical Beasts that you summoned?” The elf elder clenched his teeth after looking at the horde of Horned Bee Beasts beside Yang Ling. He took out a small clay bottle from his robes. “This is the Water of the Spring of Life our tribe has left for the year. It can hasten the evolution of your Magical Beasts. With this many Horned Bee Beasts, even successfully evolving a portion of them to the second stage would increase your combat abilities dramatically, much less all of them!”</p> <p>For the safety of his tribe, the elf elder had taken out his treasure. At the same time, he could not understand how Yang Long was able to summon this many Horned Bee Beasts. Typically, Summoners would only be able to summon one or two Magical Beasts, but Yang Ling had managed to summon a full horde of beasts.</p> <p>Seeing how serious the elf elder was, Yang Ling understood that what the elder produced was a serious treasure. He accepted it without hesitation. “I am not a Summoner; these Horned Bee Beasts have been with me since I was little.”</p> <p>“Oh, so that’s why!” The elf elder did not probe any further as he saw that Yang Ling was unwilling to elaborate. He told him how to use the precious Water of the Spring of Life.</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged, Yang Ling chose a hundred Horned Bee Beasts, the most ferocious of his army. He poured a drop of the precious Water of the Spring of Life onto each of them and consumed the rest. Quickly, the little critters grew to the size of a fist. Mysterious symbols once again surrounded the beasts before disappearing.</p> <p>At the same time, Yang Ling felt the pagoda mark on his forehead turn hot. A warm current was slowly circulating within his body. His wizard powers were becoming more powerful.</p> <p>“An Ancient Summoner?” The elf elder looked excitedly at Yang Ling. “Even a great Summoner would not be able to contain hundreds of Magical Beasts, much less an ordinary Summoner.”</p> <p>The elf elder was incredibly excited. According to the historical annals, an Ancient Summoner had immense spiritual powers and could gather large numbers of Magical Beasts to do battle. As an Ancient Summoner, even though Yang Ling could only control low level Magical Beasts like the Horned Bee Beasts, the immense number explained everything. His potential was unimaginable.</p> <p>With an Ancient Summoner like Yang Ling helping them, the elder believed that they would be able to avert this crisis even if Ymir were to return with a horde of gryphons.</p> <p>Yang Ling gave a faint smile as he looked at the excited elf elder. He did not confirm the elder’s suspicions, nor did he deny them. In reality, the elder might think of him as a lunatic if he were to say that he came from another planet. Since they were willing to think of him as a so-called Ancient Summoner, then it would be better if he did not clear up the misunderstanding. He might even be able to gain something from it.</p> <p>After collecting himself, Yang Ling had a thought and instinctively formed a hand gesture. Suddenly, the hundred evolved Horned Bee Beasts appeared before everyone out of thin air. They bared their fangs, barely containing their bloodlust. It felt like they had grown even larger after being stored in the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda for some time.</p> <p>Poison stingers?</p> <p>Quickly, Yang Ling noticed that the evolved Horned Bee Beasts had gained another power—poison stinger attacks. A Horned Bee Beast that had evolved to the second stage could shoot out three highly poisonous stingers from its tail a day. The stingers were fast as lightning. Those hit by the stingers would feel their bodies turn numb immediately. More severe symptoms included slipping into a coma.</p>",
  "Chapter 7: An Extraordinary Misunderstanding": "<p>After standing up and testing his powers, Yang Ling noticed that his strength and wizard powers had improved considerably. He now had a shocking explosive power. With the sudden increase in speed, he could now move like an unevolved Horned Bee Beasts. The elves were amazed.</p> <p>Yang Ling could not help but exclaim that the elves’ Water of the Spring of Life was indeed a powerful treasure after looking at his evolved, fist-sized Horned Bee Beasts as well as witnessing the change to the wizard powers in his body. It had a better effect than consuming several blood orbs from Magical Beasts.</p> <p>“How could we get this Ancient Summoner to stay and help us?” Now that the slave-capturing squad of the humans was becoming more and more brazen, the prettier members of his tribe would become their primary target. The elf elder was very worried.</p> <p>Just as the elf elder was thinking up a plan, an elf carrying a basket of arrows made of purple sandalwood charged into the room. “Elder, the dwarves have visited us with a large number of weapons!”</p> <p>“Good, this is great, invite them in!”</p> <p>The elder had not finished his sentence when a commotion broke out outside the room. “Elder, we are thirsty, get us a few barrels of rum!”</p> <p>A dark-faced dwarf, his height reaching about Yang Ling’s chest, swaggered into the room and sat down on a light green bamboo chair after tossing the bag he was carrying onto the ground.</p> <p>Even though he was not tall, the dark-faced dwarf was incredibly well-built. His arm was thicker than the long-haired beauty Sofia’s thigh. The dwarf could not keep still despite sitting down. He constantly shifted his watermelon-like butt, causing the bamboo chair to creak incessantly. Yang Ling was worried that the chair would shatter under the weight.</p> <p>“Sofia, me and the poor members of my tribe have walked in the mountains for the entire day, can’t you give us a few glasses of rum to quench our thirst?” The dwarf feigned a pathetic look and stared at Sofia. “If not, one glass is alright too. I have not tasted alcohol for a full month now. Oh god, I am too pitiful!”</p> <p>“Alright, Rumi, you drunkard. You’re going to drink yourself into a stupor again!” As she was saying this, Sofia poured a glass of delicious rum for the dwarf, then filled Yang Ling’s glass.</p> <p>After finishing his rum in a gulp and looking at Yang Ling’s full cup, the dwarf felt the injustice deeply. “Sofia, this is not fair! You poured your lover a full glass of rum, but only gave me such a little amount. It’s not enough to quench my thirst, I want another cup!”</p> <p>Lover?</p> <p>Sofia felt ashamed and angry after she heard the dwarf Rumi’s words. She fiercely twisted Rumi’s filthy ear and left. As she was leaving, she silently turned to look at Yang Ling, her face red.</p> <p>“Come, Brother Rumi, I’ll treat you to a cup!”</p> <p>Seeing the dwarf pick up the flask of rum and drink every last drop, Yang Ling laughed and pushed his glass of rum over.</p> <p>The dwarf did not hesitate to down the large glass of rum in a gulp. After releasing a burp, he gave a thumbs up to Yang Ling. “Brother, that was nice of you. I’ll treat you to a drink next time, we’ll drink by the barrels!”</p> <p>“Look at this lad, still the same as always. Rumi, what did your father get you to bring over this time? Let me see quickly!” The elder elf gave a charitable smile as he saw the dwarf beginning to fall into a drunken stupor.</p> <p>After patting his head, the dwarf finally recalled that he was here for a reason and ordered the members of his clan to unravel the package for the elder.</p> <p>Yang Ling took a cursory glance. Other than a small number of swords, the bulk of the weapons were steel armor, bows, and arrows.</p> <p>Yang Ling tried flailing a sword, but he felt that it was a little too heavy. He struck hard and managed to slice off a thick branch cleanly. The sword was rather sharp. Yang Ling tapped on the blade of the longsword and heard a crisp feedback. He understood that the longsword was sufficiently hard and flexible, at least better than the cleaver he used to slice his meat and vegetables.</p> <p>Yang Ling studied electronics, but he had been sent to a metal factory by the school for his internship. Who knew what the old man in his school had been thinking. But after staying there for a month, he could at least evaluate the materials, hardness, and flexibility of an item. To think that he would be able to come across steel of this quality even on this ancient continent. He was quite interested in the dwarf’s mines and smithing techniques.</p> <p>“Brother, you can take any weapon you fancy, just treat me to a few cups of beer in the future!” The dwarf Rumi generously patted Yang Ling on the shoulder, his sooty hands leaving a fresh mark on Yang Ling’s white jacket. But if he were to know that Yang Ling was comparing the weapon he created with much effort to a cleaver that was sold by the roadside, he might become livid.</p> <p>After evading Rumi’s harassment, Yang Ling flicked the blade of the sword. “How much ore of this quality do you have left? How about you sell a portion of it to me?”</p> <p>Yang Ling understood from the Horned Bee Beasts’ memories that steel ores could be used to feed them. The teeth of the Horned Bee Beasts were very sharp and could shatter even steel, much less rocks. Their armor would become harder after they consumed various metals.</p> <p>Even though he did not understand why he would be transported to this forest, Yang Ling knew that if he were to survive in this primordial forest, other than cultivating the mysterious wizard mantra, taming the Horned Bee Beasts would offer him the best chance of survival. Increasing their abilities was the next step to going home.</p> <p>“What, you only want the ores?” the dwarf exclaimed in shock. Many people were fighting to purchase the weapons forged by his tribe, but this was the first time he heard that someone wanted only the ore. “Brother, are you thinking of smashing walls like a giant throwing rocks by bringing only the steel ores into battle?”</p> <p>After staring at Yang Ling for a while and noticing that he was not joking, Rumi creased his brows. It was not that he was unwilling to sell Yang Ling the ores, but he did not know what price he could give. He would be embarrassed to give a high price since Yang Ling seemed to be rather close with Sofia, but he would be unable to account to the members of the clan if he gave a low price.</p> <p>Yang Ling understood why Rumi was in a tight spot. After smiling mysteriously, he took out twenty Magical Beast essences he had obtained over the days from his robes and said, “You can take these as a deposit. Of course, if you are willing, I can exchange them with good alcohol in the future!”</p> <p>There were rich resources in this forest: clear, sweet spring water, sufficient sunlight, fully organic ingredients… The resources here were one of a kind. Perhaps it would be a good idea to open up a brewery here. Just the clear spring water here was better than any brand name mineral water back on earth.</p> <p>After exchanging formalities and under the support of the elf elder, Yang Ling managed to obtain two thousand pieces of quality steel ore using twenty-five essence crystals and ten barrels of rum. It was enough to feed his Horned Bee Beast army for a good half a month even without needing to hunt.</p> <p>People thought that Yang Ling must have been born into a wealthy family. An average person would be satisfied even obtaining just one of the weapons forged by the dwarves, but Yang Ling only wanted a large amount of ore. He was either a lunatic or a rich nobleman who had everything. If he was the latter, he would not pay any attention to ordinary weapons.</p> <p>Also, the essence crystal of a low level Magical Beast was worth at least ten Purple Crystal Coins and could feed five families for several years, yet Yang Ling offered twenty-five of them at a go. Other than a few human nobles from the capital, who else could do something like that?</p>",
  "Chapter 8: Volcano Valley": "<p>After enjoying himself for several days, the dwarf Rumi left satisfied with his ten barrels of rum. Before he left, he promised that he would lead the brave warriors of his tribe into battle should the elf tribe get attacked again. He also warmly invited Yang Ling to visit the dwarf tribe.</p> <p>“This dwarf is interesting indeed!” Yang Ling laughed.</p> <p>“He is a boor and often utters nonsense!” Sofia blushed as she thought about how Rumi called Yang Ling her lover in front of everyone. She took a peek at the smiling Yang Ling.</p> <p>After being saved by Yang Ling at the critical moment, Sofia was filled with gratitude toward him. She could not imagine what kind of humiliation she would have gone through if she had not been saved; she was also very surprised when Yang Ling emerged from the treetops and revealed himself. She did not expect her benefactor to be this dashing, nor did she expect that he could control such a large group of Magical Beasts despite his young age.</p> <p>Elves did not fancy humans as most of them were greedy and scheming, but Yang Ling was an exception. In just a few days time, he had gotten friendly with the elves. Slowly, Sofia also began to feel something strange when she was around him. She liked listening to his stories, she liked how he sometimes looked a little dazed when looking at her, and she liked the feeling she got when she was around him.</p> <p>“Haha, the brat Rumi is a carbon copy of his father!” The elder laughed. “Mountain dwarves are naturally forthright and powerful. They are not only adept at making weapons and armor, they are also brave warriors!”</p> <p>Yang Ling looked at the bamboo chair beside him and smiled. “That’s right, they sure are powerful. They almost crushed the bamboo chair!”</p> <p>The elves couldn’t help but chuckle. Sofia laughed as she wiped off the stains Rumi’s sooty hands had left on the bamboo chair. Her glistening black hair, long lashes, fair neck, and slender waist tempted Yang Ling.</p> <p>He did not know why he had felt the flames of passion within him throughout these last few days. Yang Ling could not help but think wild thoughts whenever he saw Sofia’s fair, gentle skin or alluring figure. Sometimes, he would recall the suited lady he had stood behind on the bus the other day. He would recall his excitement when he saw her perky butt and cleavage.</p> <p>What was even weirder to him was how the pagoda-shaped mark on his forehead would burn whenever he was overcome with lust. The mark would even throb slightly, much to his confusion. In his lack of understanding, he could only bear with that for the moment. He pretty much got used to it after the throbbing occurred on several different occasions.</p> <p>Over the next few days, in order to quickly enhance his abilities, Yang Ling either spent the day training his Horned Bee Beasts or cultivating his wizard mantra.</p> <p>After repeated practice, in an attempt to increase the Horned Bee Beasts’ attacking power, Yang Ling split his army of two thousand or so Horned Bee Beasts into ten teams and chose ten of the most ferocious beasts to lead the teams. Each large team was split into a further ten groups, each group consisting of twenty Horned Bee Beasts. The groups were led by Horned Bee Beasts that had evolved to the second stage.</p> <p>After the evolution, the hundred Horned Bee Beasts had experienced huge improvements, both in intellect and battle abilities. Yang Ling also found it easier to give them instructions. Be it in their attacking or defending abilities, the Horned Bee Beasts that had been taught a battle strategy showed more impressive results, far surpassing their wild counterparts.</p> <p>There was a light drizzle that morning. Yang Ling had wanted to sleep in for a little while longer, but the long-haired beauty Sofia approached him bright and early.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, there was a slight drizzle this morning, and any purple orchids picked now would be great for making rum. Do you want to go?” Sofia looked shyly at Yang Ling, who was not wearing a shirt. Her beautiful eyes, slightly blushing cheeks, and youthful fragrance all caused Yang Ling’s heart to beat faster.</p> <p>Yang Ling instinctively looked at Sofia’s perky breasts and slender thighs. If he were to judge them according to Earth’s beauty standards, the young elves in this tribe would all be classified as extreme beauties. Sofia would be the cream of the crop. Standing before her, even a famous actress would pale in comparison, much less the belle he had chased after in the past.</p> <p>“I’ll go, of course I’ll go!” Yang Ling wiped his face with cold water. “To be able to take a stroll with the prettiest lady in the elf tribe, how can I miss such an opportunity!”</p> <p>Prettiest lady in the elf tribe?</p> <p>Sofia turned red when she heard Yang Ling, her watery eyes bulging. She felt shy, as well as unprecedentedly joyful, when she looked at Yang Ling’s strong muscles and his charismatic gaze.</p> <p>After a little preparation, Yang Ling left with the ladies of the elf tribe to explore the Terras Forest amidst the drizzle.</p> <p>“Comfortable, much better than any topnotch oxygen cafe back on Earth!”</p> <p>Yang Ling stretched comfortably as he strolled between the trees and took deep breaths of the cool air. When he had just graduated, he and some friends had visited an oxygen cafe touted to have the best source of oxygen in the world. It felt alright back then, but now that it was compared to this clean, natural air, it felt like garbage.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, we must give thanks to the Goddess of Nature! Be it the lush forests or the clean air, these are all blessings given to us by the goddess!” Sofia closed her bright eyes, touched her heart with her right hand, and started giving a silent prayer.</p> <p>The world was silent.</p> <p>In that moment, looking at Sofia and her flowing white dress, her long lashes and peaceful expression, Yang Ling felt serenity coming from the forest. He did not believe in gods, but at this moment, he felt as though the Goddess of Nature from the legends was just over the horizon.</p> <p>“Hey, it’s getting late, let’s go!”</p> <p>After her prayer, Sofia slowly opened her eyes. She saw Yang Ling staring at her and could not help but blush. After seeing that her sisters were nowhere to be found, she realized that they were intentionally giving her some alone time with Yang Ling. Her face turned red.</p> <p>Along the way, Sofia gently picked purple orchids that were covered in morning dew and placed them into her flower basket. Her beautiful face, alluring figure, and long dancing hair attracted Yang Ling’s gaze. Sofia’s heart beat faster whenever she caught Yang Ling looking at her. Even her ears were red.</p> <p>Some time later, the two of them arrived at a quiet valley. This place was different from the other areas they had walked through. It got more desolate the farther they traveled into it. Eventually, there were not even traces of grass in the area, much less flowers.</p> <p>“Oh no, Valenia Valley. Yang Ling, leave, leave quick!” Sofia was incredibly alarmed when she realized where they were. She stopped immediately. “This is a place cursed by the demons! Leave, we must leave quickly!”</p> <p>His expression turning serious, Yang Ling also had a bad premonition. This place was too quiet. There were no insects or birds here; in fact, there was not even the sound of wind. There was a warm rumble from time to time beneath his feet. The rocks around them were very smooth, as if they had been exposed to a terrifying heat sometime in the past.</p> <p>“A dead volcano?” Yang Ling swallowed. This is surprising. The surrounding areas are rich with nature. How odd to think that there is a dead volcano here.</p> <p>Yang Ling turned to leave as he grabbed Sofia’s icy cold hand. Unexpectedly, the Horned Bee Beasts behind him were not willing to follow for the longest time. Some of them even flew forward without consideration, quickly disappearing behind a giant rock.</p> <p>Yang Ling was surprised when he saw the unusual actions of the Horned Bee Beasts. He had not had such a situation ever since he tamed the Horned Bee Beasts. Looking over in confusion, he saw that there was a good number of dark red fragments behind the giant rock. The Horned Bee Beasts were charging toward these fragments and happily devouring them.</p> <p>“Dark Fire Crystals?” Yang Ling was first shocked, but understood quickly. According to the memories of the Horned Bee Beasts, these dark red crystals were left behind after a volcano erupted. They were also the Horned Bee Beasts’ favorite food. There were fire element energies within these crystals which could boost the speed of their evolution.</p> <p>“Since we are already here, you need not worry!” Yang Ling squeezed Sofia’s hand when he saw how pale she was.</p> <p>Sofia instinctively leaned against Yang Ling’s body as she looked at the barren valley and recalled the various terrifying legends. She saw how calm Yang Ling was and felt his powerful heartbeats. Her nervousness slowly faded.</p> <p>“Oh, what is that over there?”</p> <p>Yang Ling unintentionally spotted a reflection of sunlight nearby when he was surveying the surroundings. He walked over to have a look and could not help but gasp. All he saw was a white skeleton leaning against a stone outcrop, its blank eyes staring straight ahead. The skeleton was missing some parts, as if its bones had been blown away by a strong wind or destroyed by a wild beast.</p> <p>Beside the skeleton was a dull dagger and the few crystals of an unknown Magical Beast. There was also a black badge beside the skeleton. Carved on the badge was a soaring eagle as well as several ancient characters. But neither Sofia nor Yang Ling could decipher the words.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, this person is too pitiful. Let’s bury him!” Even though she said this, Sofia leaned into Yang Ling’s arms in fear when she saw the incomplete skeleton, not daring to take a step forward.</p> <p>After shaking his head, Yang Ling grabbed the dagger and dug a hole about half the height of an average human before dragging the skeleton over. Just as he was about to bury the skeleton, he noticed in shock that there was an ancient, pale silver ring lodged on the right middle finger of the skeleton. He pulled it off in curiosity.</p> <p>“You don’t need this in the afterlife, rest in peace!” After filling the hole, Yang Ling put the silver ring on his middle finger.</p> <p>After observing for a moment, Sofia hesitated to say, “Yang Ling, this looks like a Space Ring. Try dripping a drop of blood onto it!”</p> <p>Space Ring?</p> <p>Even though he was a little confused, Yang Ling bit his index finger and allowed a drop of blood to fall onto the old ring. Just as the blood came into contact with the ring, mysterious symbols appeared around the ring. Following which, the ring locked tightly around his finger. He could not take off the ring, try as he might.</p>",
  "Chapter 9: Weak Magical Beasts": "<p>Yang Ling quickly understood how to use the Space Ring after Sofia explained it to him. The Space Ring was a sort of magical storage space, and he only needed a thought to quickly put in or take out an item.</p> <p>There were many things in the Space Ring. There were various minerals, a few crates full of crystal coins, as well as a large stack of books. In that instant, Yang Ling felt dizzy just looking at all the items.</p> <p>“Mind Magic for Beginners, Gryphon Techniques, Research on Secret Silver Ores…” Yang Ling nonchalantly picked out a few books from the stack, and each of them shocked the elf Sofia.</p> <p>“Mind Magic?” Sofia said in surprise, grabbing the thick book from Yang Ling’s hands. “Yang Ling, when this skeleton was alive, his status was definitely not simple!”</p> <p>“So what if it wasn’t simple? He still returned to the dirt after he died!”</p> <p>Sofia was shocked, but Yang Ling did not think too much about it. Just as he was about to carefully scrutinize the items in the Space Ring, the Horned Bee Beast leading the group suddenly let out a howl, leading the group of Horned Bee Beasts back toward him.</p> <p>“Sofia, be careful!” Yang Ling had a bad premonition when he saw the unusual behavior of the Horned Bee Beasts. He hugged the flustered Sofia and observed the surroundings closely, preparing himself for any surprises.</p> <p>Quickly, rustles could be heard. A group of strange creatures emerged from behind the rubble. They had large heads, yet their bodies were only about the thickness of a water bottle. They all had a thin tentacle on each side of their bodies, as well as a bowl-sized eye in the center of their foreheads.</p> <p>“So they are Evil Eyes!” Sofia heaved a sigh of relief as she leaned in Yang Ling’s embrace. “They are low level Magical Creatures that live in groups. They can shoot laser beams. Even though they are rather slow, we should still be careful!”</p> <p>Yang Ling quickly understood what she meant by rather slow. The Evil Eye directly opposite them attacked without warning, releasing bolts of chopstick-sized beams of light. The attacks left holes in the wall behind them. Even though the beams were powerful, the speed and accuracy of the projectiles were laughable. They had to store energy for half a day after every round of projectiles, and Yang Ling and Sofia could easily avoid the projectiles they released.</p> <p>Yang Ling was even more relaxed by the fact that even though a portion of them would attack with all their might, a good portion of them would just stay by the side and look on. He did not know if this was because they were confident of their numbers, or if they just lacked intellect. In fact, some of the creatures even spread out in search of food, picking up and consuming the Dark Fire Crystals.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, two hundred Horned Bee Beasts started to attack. They formed a triangular formation and swarmed over, freely assaulting the slow Evil Eyes as if they were fighter jets.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts rained down on the creatures, stabbing with their sharp black horns before ripping their flesh off with their shiny fangs. The Horned Bee Beasts dug out deep holes on the eyes or heads of the Evil Eyes. The Evil Eyes that were under attack let out pathetic cries, struggling before they fell helplessly.</p> <p>Seeing the precise attacks of the Horned Bee Beasts, the leader of the Evil Eyes tried to consolidate their firepower. But they were slow, often losing their targets before they could even take aim.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, the Horned Bee Beasts made use of their speedy movements and forced the Evil Eyes to retreat. They sometimes scattered in the air, easily avoiding the light beams of the Evil Eyes; other times, they grouped together and attacked the defenseless Evil Eyes as a group. Sofia was shocked to see how powerful these Horned Bee Beasts were compared to their wild counterparts.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, a mere two hundred Horned Bee Beasts were enough to disrupt the Evil Eyes’ battle formation. The situation only turned slightly more advantageous for the Evil Eyes after their leader managed to successfully gather all the Evil Eyes.</p> <p>The power of the Evil Eyes’ attacks were improved as they combined their efforts and formed a rain of light beams. Even though the beams of light they shot out were still messy and all over the place, there were a few Horned Bee Beasts that were unfortunate enough to be hit.</p> <p>At the same time, the giant rocks around them became targets for the Evil Eyes, the light beams creating little holes within them. Even though the Evil Eyes could not launch an effective offensive, their firepower was decent. Perhaps that was how they got their status as low level Magical Beasts.</p> <p>With his speed, Yang Ling dodged the Evil Eyes’ attacks with Sofia in his arms. Soon after, seeing the holes on the giant rocks, Yang Ling came up with an idea.</p> <p>He told Sofia to hide behind a giant rock. Yang Ling did not retreat. Instead, he advanced. He bit on his right index finger as he charged quickly toward the Evil Eyes. At the same time, he commanded the Horned Bee Beasts to launch a full assault. Under his command, the Horned Bee Beasts attacked the non-vital areas of the Evil Eyes. They did not kill the Evil Eyes, but instead, they rendered the creatures unable to move or attack.</p> <p>Yang Ling did not stop. He dripped a drop of blood on the head of every injured Evil Eye. When Sofia wasn’t looking, he would consume a Blood Orb made by crystallizing blood essences from Magical Beasts, quickly replenishing the energy and wizard powers he spent taming the Evil Eyes.</p> <p>After coming into contact with Yang Ling’s blood, a silver glow enveloped the Evil Eyes. Mysterious symbols also appeared, creating an effect similar to what happened with the Horned Bee Beasts. At the same time, Yang Ling felt a streak of warm current enter his body. He also gained many more unfocused memories in his mind.</p> <p>After moving through the group, Yang Ling had soon managed to tame a large portion of the Evil Eyes. Counting them after the battle was over, he realized that he had tamed about two thousand Evil Eyes, so their numbers were similar to the Horned Bee Beasts. The price was that he had to consume more than two hundred Blood Orbs, all that he had gathered recently.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, this… This is the Ancient Summoning Magic?”</p> <p>Sofia was dumbfounded when she saw Yang Ling quickly taming the Evil Eyes. She had never expected that such a powerful Summoning Magic existed. He did not have to use magical powers, nor did he recite incantations; all he did was use a drop of blood to summon two thousand Evil Eyes. He lived up to his reputation of an Ancient Summoner of the legends.</p> <p>After giving a mysterious smile, Yang Ling did not confirm or deny Sofia’s statement. The Wizard’s Pagoda was a secret that his survival relied on, and he did not want anyone to know about it. Also, there were still many things he did not know about the Wizard’s Pagoda, so he couldn’t explain it even if he wanted to.</p> <p>Yang Ling’s face was rather pale even though he had consumed a large number of Blood Orbs. After all, he had tamed a large number of Evil Eyes. He was lucky that his wizard powers had improved after consuming the Water of the Spring of Life, and that the Evil Eyes were all injured by the Horned Bee Beasts; otherwise, there was no way he could have pulled it off.</p> <p>After resting for a moment, Yang Ling excitedly commanded the Evil Eyes into a formation. The firepower of the Evil Eyes wasn’t weak. Even though they required some time between attacks, this weakness could be offset with the correct strategy.</p> <p>Yang Ling recalled the famous three column cannon formation used by Napoleon when he thought about the ancient cannons used in the eighteenth century. He arranged the Evil Eyes into three rows, the first row prowling on the ground, the second squatting, while the third row stood. The three rows would fire successively. This way, he could create a continuous web of firepower. With the terrifying number of Evil Eyes he had at his disposal, his offensive capabilities were now greatly increased.</p> <p>Sofia looked at the busy Yang Ling. Slowly, her shock turned into admiration.</p> <p>He had a massive number of Horned Bee Beasts and excellent training methods. After summoning a large number of Evil Eyes, he could perfectly balance their strengths and weaknesses in the blink of an eye. Sofia felt that the more she learned about Yang Ling, the more shrouded in mystery he became.</p> <p>Buying a mountain of minerals with a large number of Essence Crystals might be unimaginable to many, but Yang Ling did not hesitate. He seemed to be a rich person who spent money like water, but when he was busy, he could do without his meals or fill his stomach with ordinary food. He did not have airs of a noble.</p> <p>Possessing a strange summoning magic and a large number of Magical Beasts, Yang Ling seemed to be a powerful Ancient Summoner of the legends. But he did not know what the foundations of magic were, nor did he know what a Space Ring was. In fact, he did not seem to know how expensive the Essence Crystal of a Magical Beast was.</p> <p>Even though there were many questions surrounding Yang Ling, Sofia instead became more attracted to him. With Yang Ling around, her life became radiant and full of laughter; when she saw the suave Yang Ling, her heart would unexplainably beat faster.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, how did you come up with this strange yet effective method?” Sofia instinctively took out her handkerchief and prepared to wipe his forehead when she saw the sweaty Yang Ling. But she felt a little embarrassed.</p> <p>“Haha, Sofia, I’ll tell you the truth, these ideas were all given to me by the Goddess of Nature!” After storing the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes into the strange space that was the Wizard’s Pagoda, Yang Ling gave a mysterious smile. “Let’s go, my elf beauty. If we do not make our way back soon, the tender orchids will be dried out by the sun!”</p> <p>Sofia blushed when she heard Yang Ling call her a beauty. She scanned Yang Ling with her large eyes before leaving. Besides her shyness, she had a sweet feeling in her heart.</p> <p>Referring to the memories of the Evil Eyes, Yang Ling understood that there were many deep caves within the valley, and in those caves were countless monsters. Legends also said it that there was a subterranean city sealed somewhere underground, overrun with monsters. His wizard powers were depleted, and he could not explore the valley even if he wanted to. All he could do was come back if there was a suitable opportunity.</p>",
  "Chapter 10: Magical Beast Army": "<p>Hunting was the best training. After taming a large number of Evil Eyes, Yang Ling seized opportunities to train their attacking and defending techniques in a variety of situations. In order to strengthen the natural battle abilities of the Evil Eyes, he would sometimes have one face off against a ferocious Magical Beast alone.</p> <p>Under his training, the nonchalant disposition of the Evil Eyes changed drastically. They would gather together when they sensed any action near them and blast the target with consolidated beams of light.</p> <p>Similar to the Horned Bee Beasts, the Evil Eyes also had an obvious transformation after staying in the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda for some time. Their eyeballs changed from blue to a light green, and their tentacles became longer and more nimble. The beams of light they fired also changed from white to a pale green, from the size of a thumb to the thickness of a walnut. In the past, the beams of light could only create centimeter-deep holes in stone walls, but now, the holes the beams created here about half a chopstick deep.</p> <p>Today, Yang Ling was eyeing a Twin-horned Deer near some bushes. He waited silently for an opportunity to strike. Over the last few days, he had already led the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes to successfully take down several low level Magical Beasts and had obtained dozens of precious Magical Beast Essence Crystals. At the same time, he also gathered upward of a hundred Magical Beast Blood Orbs.</p> <p>The Twin-horned Deer had a slender body, the patterns on its fur an intertwining black and white. It had muscular limbs and was considered a mid-low level Magical Beast. It had the natural ability to release wind daggers. At full sprint, it could run as fast as the wind. To an average person, this was definitely a Magical Beast that was difficult to subdue. But to Yang Ling, this was not difficult; all he needed was to be patient and await the right opportunity.</p> <p>As it exhaled, the Twin-horned Deer released a thick bolt of wind, slicing apart the tender branches of a tree before swallowing them with a gulp. It flailed its tail, chasing away chopstick-sized bloodsucking flies.</p> <p>At the same time, Yang Ling cautiously created a formation with about two hundred Horned Bee Beasts. A moment later, seeing that the Twin-horned Deer had not noticed anything off, Yang Ling released half of his Evil Eyes and ordered them to silently occupy an area advantageous to them.</p> <p>A breeze blew past. The Twin-horned Deer straightened its ears, a little alarmed. It listened carefully to its surroundings; its nose twitched, as if it was trying to discern strange scents in its surroundings.</p> <p>Was the attack going to fail?</p> <p>Seeing that the Twin-horned Deer seemed to have noticed something, Yang Ling quickly collected himself and came up with an idea. He patted lightly on the Horned Bee Beast beside him. The little critter understood and slowly dug out from within the bushes. Over the days of practice, he had already tamed the Horned Bee Beasts to an extreme degree.</p> <p>The worries of the Twin-horned Deer vanished when it saw the Horned Bee Beast lazily searching for food. It continued munching on the tender branches, unaware of the danger that it was in. With winter approaching, it had searched everywhere for a mouthful of the sweet, tender branches.</p> <p>In the instant the Twin-horned Deer lowered its head, Yang Ling called for action. The Evil Eyes acted. In that moment, after a flurry of light beams, the body of the Twin-horned Deer became covered with bullet holes. It twitched for a second before collapsing onto the ground.</p> <p>“Haha, Essence Crystal number fifty!”</p> <p>Yang Ling sliced off the head of the Twin-horned Deer with a dagger and extracted a dark green Essence Core. He gathered the blood essence of the Twin-horned Deer into two thumb-sized Blood Orbs before allowing the Horned Bee Beasts to devour its body.</p> <p>After resting for a moment, Yang Ling recalled the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes before exploring the forest, searching for the tracks of his next prey.</p> <p>“Help me…”</p> <p>Yang Ling suddenly heard a pathetic cry as he was walking past a small hill. He listened seriously. He could hear the faint sounds of a battle. At the same time, the wind brought along the faint scent of blood.</p> <p>Could it be a hunter that came across a Magical Beast?</p> <p>There were not many people in the nearby forest, and it was rare to see anyone around these parts. In his confusion, Yang Ling followed the scent of the blood, jumping from tree to tree and quickly arriving at the scene. Ever since he successfully tamed the two thousand Evil Eyes, his power and speed had considerable improvements.</p> <p>“Hmph, you’re trying to escape? You are asking for death!” said a two-meter-tall barbarian as he walked toward a human dressed in tattered clothes. The axe in his hand was larger than a tire.</p> <p>The barbarian had a muscular build, his strength immense. He had been a fighter from birth, a powerful warrior from the mountains. It was said that the elite warriors from their tribe could go one on one against an Iron Lizard, a mid level Magical Beast, with their bare fists. Over the days, Yang Ling had gained an understanding of the area around the elf tribe because of the beautiful Sofia.</p> <p>“I’d rather die in battle than become your so-called sacrifice!” A human warrior covered in blood clenched a sharp wooden bat tightly in his hands. Behind him, other than a few warriors also covered in blood, twenty humans were huddled together in fear. There were old men, some children, and even a mother carrying a child.</p> <p>On the ground were dozens of human corpses, some decapitated, some split into two. There were even some who were smashed into pulp; dark red innards, bloody intestines… It was a shocking scene. It looked like what happened just now was a one-sided massacre.</p> <p>Taking a few steps forward, the barbarian leading the group licked the blood off his axe. “You filthy humans should feel lucky that you can become our sacrifice!”</p> <p>Seeing the barbarian’s red tongue, seeing him swallow the flesh stuck on his axe, the humans shivered in fear. Some closed their eyes tightly and prayed for the blessings of god; some had dazed expressions, as if they had lost their souls. Some immediately fainted after letting out a scream.</p> <p>The leading barbarian lifted his ax into the air and said fiercely, “Now, you only have two choices. Obediently follow us back and become our sacrifice, or die where you stand!”</p> <p>Looking at the merciless barbarians, hearing their raw threats, the human warrior standing in front tightened his grip on his wooden club. After considering it for a moment, he softly instructed the person behind him, “Argus, lead the rest to the south later. If I remember correctly, there is a tribe of forest elves in that direction. Even though we humans are not welcome by the elves, the elves that follow the Goddess of Nature will not leave us in the lurch!”</p> <p>“No, Casey, I am not leaving. We leave together!” Argus’s eyes were red. He clenched his teeth as he looked at the barbarians to the other side of them.</p> <p>A month before, in order to earn some money for his sick mother, Argus had followed the troops and Casey into the Terras Forest to hunt. But he did not expect to suddenly come across the terrifying barbarians after they had successfully hunted some Twin-horned Deer and were returning home with a few Essence Crystals. After they were captured, they were kept alive to be the sacrifice of the barbarians. Once every few days, one of them would be dragged out and thrown into a deep pit.</p> <p>Casey did not say anymore after he looked at the determined Argus. The elf tribe to the south was dozens of kilometers away. With how tired they were, how many of them would escape the pursuit of the barbarian mountain warriors?</p> <p>“Haha, since you are asking for death, then do not blame us for exterminating you!” The leading barbarian let out a cold grunt and ordered the group to charge forward. A few of the violent barbarians howled loudly as they charged.</p> <p>Casey looked to the west as he gripped his feeble wooden club, then charged forward without looking back. His hometown, Wissen Town, was to the west of Terras Forest. There, he had his benevolent mother, his little angel who was not even five years old yet, and his beloved wife.</p> <p>As he looked at the ferocious barbarians, the enormous axe that almost seemed to be growing as it came towards him, Casey did not ask for anything else. Dragging just one barbarian into the grave with him was good enough. But just as he was about to die together with his enemies, he heard buzzes in the air behind him. Following which, a group of ferocious Horned Bee Beasts flew past him like the wind.</p> <p>At the critical moment, Yang Ling had sent out his army of Magical Beasts. After the long training, the cooperation between the Evil Eyes and the Horned Bee Beasts had gotten better. It was a good time to test their battle abilities against these merciless barbarians.</p> <p>Caught off guard, the barbarians were instantly overwhelmed. Some of them were blinded, pressing their hands to their bleeding eyes and stumbling around like headless flies. Some called for their parents, pressing on their heads to prevent brain matter from spilling out. Some were reduced to bones in the blink of an eye, falling over in disbelief.</p> <p>If one were to compare the Horned Bee Beasts to a sharp blade, what the barbarians experienced next was the power of a cannon. A large group of Evil Eyes appeared out of thin air and quickly arranged themselves into a weird, half-moon formation before shooting out bolts of thick green light.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, the Evil Eyes shot out continuous light beams, creating a giant, intertwining web of firepower. Everything within their range of fire was mercilessly reduced into nothing. Even giant rocks were obliterated in the blink of an eye.</p>",
  "Chapter 11: Poison Stingers": "<p>Facing such a sudden, fierce attack, the unarmored barbarians suffered heavy casualties. Other than a lucky few, all of them were blasted into pieces by the light beams of the Evil Eyes.</p> <p>Seeing the barren land before them and the giant rocks blasted to smithereens, the people who were saved were dumbfounded. No one would have expected the merciless barbarians to be reduced to nothing in just the blink of an eye.</p> <p>“Thank you sir, for saving us!” After realizing that he was not dreaming, the surprised Casey knelt before Yang Ling. Quickly, under his lead, the rest of the people knelt as well.</p> <p>“Stand up, it was nothing, you need not pay too much heed to it!” After sending a group of Horned Bee Beasts to patrol the surroundings, Yang Ling returned the rest of his Magical Beast army.</p> <p>“Thank you for saving us!”</p> <p>“You will definitely have good karma for having such a good heart!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>After repeatedly thanking Yang Ling, the group of people stood up and cried tears of joy. They were incredibly excited, having successfully escaped with their lives. Only a skinny girl continued kneeling in grief. She cried and pleaded, “Sir, please save Alice’s grandfather, he is going to be pushed into the abyss by the barbarians!”</p> <p>The young girl cried as she crawled toward Yang Ling. Her eyes were red, swollen and filled with tears. Her knees seemed to be injured, perhaps scraped by the rocks on the ground. She left behind a trail of blood wherever she passed.</p> <p>“Sir, please save Alice’s grandfather, Alice is willing to become your servant until death, sir…”</p> <p>Alice cried as she lifted her head, her tears falling on her long eyelashes. Her large bright eyes were filled with boundless grief. Her skinny shoulders and slender waist made her look even more pitiful.</p> <p>Yang Ling had wanted to leave after saving this group of people, but he was unable to decline after seeing the pitiful Alice.</p> <p>At the same time, as they saw the grieving Alice, the rest of the group also wanted to kneel and plead for Yang Ling’s help. But when they recalled how heavily guarded the barbarian tribe was, as well as the brave warriors within the tribe, they began to hesitate. Even though Yang Ling was powerful, he was but one person. How could they allow their benefactor to risk his life?</p> <p>“Sir, we still have dozens of family members in the hands of the barbarians. Do you have any followers or partners around?”</p> <p>As a wandering troop for many years, Casey understood that a powerful Summoner like Yang Ling would have several powerful followers around him. If Yang Ling was willing to help, then saving the people from the barbarian tribe was not a hopeless situation.</p> <p>Followers?</p> <p>Yang Ling gave a bitter smile. He was alone, and the only reinforcements he had nearby were the elf tribe. But the elves were preparing for Ymir’s attack, so it wasn’t feasible to ask them for an army.</p> <p>After conversing for a few minutes, Yang Ling got the general idea of what happened. It turned out that the barbarians had captured a large number of risk takers who entered Terras Forest. They kept the humans captive, and they would drag one of them out once every couple of days and push them into a deep hole as a sacrifice.</p> <p>A few hours ago, Casey and the group had risked their lives and escaped their cells. But the barbarians reacted quickly. Most of the people did not have the opportunity to escape. And that included Alice’s elderly grandfather.</p> <p>“They’re using living humans as sacrifices?” Yang Ling shook his head. He recalled the African tribes back on Earth that roasted humans as if they were wild boars. He hesitated for a moment before clenching his teeth. “Since that is the case, then I guess I’ll have to make a trip there!”</p> <p>Even though the barbarians were powerful and had the numbers advantage, Yang Ling believed that even if he could not save everyone with his Magical Beast army, his abilities would be enough for him to escape to safety if he needed to. Heading to the barbarian tribe could not only allow him to save the captured humans, it would also reinforce his understanding of the local tribes of the area, a win-win situation.</p> <p>After Yang Ling agreed, the group once again knelt in thanks. Many of them still had relatives trapped within the tribe. Tears flowed when they remembered their faces and the sound of their voices.</p> <p>Without waiting, Yang Ling rejected the group’s request to follow, only bringing along Casey toward the barbarian tribe. Before he left, he released a Horned Bee Beast to guide the group to shelter at the nearby elf tribe. Even though the elves did not like humans very much, he thought that the elf elder would give him a little respect and allow the humans in.</p> <p>“Sir, wait for me, I want to go with you!” The little girl Alice followed, determined, after they had advanced a distance. Yang Ling and Casey had to let her follow despite advising her against it, seeing how persistent she was.</p> <p>The forest around the barbarian tribe was lined with ancient, sinister trees. The three of them would come across patrolling barbarian warriors or laughter from time to time, but under the guidance of the Horned Bee Beasts, they did not have to engage in any battles.</p> <p>Scratch, scratch, scratch…</p> <p>Suddenly, Alice missed her footing and screamed. Her scream jolted awake a sleeping Eber Eagle. Yang Ling saw the beast screech as it flapped its wings. In order to avoid getting the attention of the barbarians, Yang Ling let out a cold grunt and commanded the Horned Bee Beasts around him to swarm over, instantly shutting the mouth of the eagle.</p> <p>Alice was shocked when she saw the speed of the Horned Bee Beasts, and how they devoured the unlucky Eber Eagle in the air in an instant. Luckily, Yang Ling had fast reactions. He held her waist with one hand and covered her mouth with the other. “Shhh, careful. Don’t make a sound, or we will alert the barbarian scouts!”</p> <p>Hugging the petite Alice, brushing against her gentle, elastic skin, Yang Ling unintentionally caught a whiff of her faint fragrance. He instinctively looked downward. Her breasts were not large, but they were very perky. His heart was moved.</p> <p>At the same time, being embraced tightly by Yang Ling and smelling the scent of an unfamiliar man, Alice felt flustered, and her face turned red. But seeing a group of patrolling barbarians make their way past them, all she could do was quietly lean into Yang Ling’s embrace.</p> <p>After waiting for the barbarian scouts to pass them, the three of them once again continued on their journey. Along the way, they avoided the barbarians, finally arriving at the pine forest the tribe was situated in.</p> <p>The area was surrounded by mountains and a river, and the only way in or out was a three-meter wide road. It was easy to defend, but hard to attack. Even Yang Ling was not confident that he could make it in without alerting anyone, much less the injured Casey and the inexperienced Alice.</p> <p>“Sir, what are we going to do?” Casey was more and more impressed by Yang Ling after they managed to avoid the barbarian scouts under his lead. As for Alice, she would follow anything Yang Ling said. Yang Ling was now her only hope of saving her grandfather.</p> <p>Yang Ling quickly gained the necessary intelligence after sending out a few more agile Horned Bee Beasts, but the information was rather depressing. There were many barbarian warriors guarding both ends of the road. There were also many guards patrolling the waters, making it impossible for them to infiltrate using the river. In that moment, Yang Ling could not think of any ideas other than fight their way in.</p> <p>“Sir, what are we going to do? The sun is setting. If we don’t act soon, the barbarians are going to start their sacrificial ritual!” It was Alice’s grandfather’s turn to be sacrificed today. Alice was worried.</p> <p>Seeing a thick black smoke rising from the barbarian tribe, as well as waves of wolf-like howls, Casey also became worried. The black smoke was the nightmare of the captured humans. Every time the black smoke rose, it meant that there would be one person thrown into the deep hole near the sacrificial altar of the barbarians.</p> <p>“Sir, what are we going to do? Sir…” Alice’s eyes were red and swollen. She was worried out of her mind. If not for Casey grabbing tightly on her right hand, she might have charged forward without any deliberation.</p> <p>What about a decoy?</p> <p>Yang Ling suddenly had an idea as he looked at the narrow road and the barbarians guarding it. He came up with a bold plan. “Casey, charge out and pretend to attack, remember not to run up to them; Alice, get us some of the wild vines that are growing around the area, the more the better. You are in charge of tying the barbarians up.”</p> <p>Even though he did not quite understand Yang Ling’s reasoning, Casey charged out without hesitation. Alice also quickly sprang into action. At the same time, Yang Ling jumped into the treetops and concealed himself.</p> <p>“Die!” Casey lifted a barbarian’s giant axe he had picked up and charged toward a barbarian.</p> <p>“Haha, trying to invade a tribe alone, you sure are dumber than a Sharo Boar!”</p> <p>“Ha! You’re asking for death!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The barbarians guarding the road laughed heartily when they saw Casey returning alone to invade the camp, not thinking too highly of him. But just as they were certain that the barbarians in front were going to split Casey in half, they suddenly heard them let out pathetic cries before slumping onto the ground.</p> <p>“D*mn it, you’re asking for it!”</p> <p>In their surprise, the barbarians charged forward, planning to turn Casey into mincemeat. Unexpectedly, they had just seen a Horned Bee Beast charging over when they felt their chests turn numb. They then felt as though they had lost their strength, and they could only watch helplessly as Casey kicked them away. Then Alice tied them up tightly.</p> <p>At the critical moment, Yang Ling had thought to use the hundred Horned Bee Beasts that evolved to the second level. They could shoot out three poisonous stingers a day. Even though the poison was not enough to kill, it could make his enemies numb and render them incapable of movement or battle.</p> <p>Even though the barbarians were powerful, they had almost no armor, making it hard for them to avoid the stealthy Horned Bee Beasts’ poisonous stingers. Yang Ling believed that as long as he was able to capture a batch of barbarian warriors, he could naturally do a hostage exchange with the leader of the barbarians. He might even be able to extort them.</p>",
  "Chapter 12: Who’s the Most Barbaric of Them All?": "<p>Seeing their tribesmen falling with Casey’s every move, the barbarians nearby were as surprised as they were angry. They pounced forward. No one noticed that fist-sized Horned Bee Beasts had appeared in the treetops and bushes.</p> <p>“Kill!” Casey shouted as he charged toward the nearest barbarian, his heart filled with excitement. He did not expect Yang Ling to come up with such a marvelous plan. If he previously was in awe of Yang Ling’s powerful abilities, he was now convinced of the man’s extraordinary intelligence.</p> <p>“Don’t move, I’ll turn nasty if you move!” Alice clenched her teeth as she tied up the barbarians who had lost their strength. She was excited and nervous when she saw the barbarians, who had arms thicker than her waist. She was afraid that these scary beings would jump up suddenly.</p> <p>As the chaos continued, the thick smoke in the distance slowly scattered. It was clear that the barbarians’ sacrificial ritual had been disrupted. The more hostages they could tie up now, the more possible saving her grandfather became. Alice became more and more excited, glancing toward Yang Ling in the treetops from time to time.</p> <p>To Alice, Yang Ling was a mysterious person. She had never seen a Summoner who could summon this many Magical Beasts, nor had she seen a Summoner who would choose to control low level Magical Beasts such as Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes. But without a doubt, Yang Ling’s abilities were alarming, very alarming!</p> <p>Other than his alarming abilities, Alice had also never seen a man with that black hair and those black eyes. His gaze was sometimes fiery like a ball of flame, sometimes deep like the abyss. But no matter what, Alice could not forget the feeling of his tight embrace, that strange feeling of being flustered and nervous.</p> <p>In their rage, the barbarians charged over like moths to a flame. But as the road was too narrow, they could only approach two at a time. There was no way for them to take advantage of their numbers. The barbarians behind roared loudly in their anger.</p> <p>Every time a barbarian charged forward, one of the Horned Bee Beasts that were hiding nearby shot out a near-transparent poison stinger at the critical moment, making their bodies numb before Casey struck them with an axe.</p> <p>Seeing how powerful Casey was, the violent barbarians were alarmed and angry, but they did not suspect anything in the moment. Just like that, the more barbarians that charged forward, the more hostages they captured. Even Alice’s arms were tired from tying the barbarians up, much less Casey, who was doing battle. Slowly, the casualties of the barbarians increased.</p> <p>“A bunch of fools, stand down, now!” Just as Yang Ling was worried that he would run out of poison stingers, the leader of the barbarians finally arrived with a group of elite guards. “Since we have friends visiting the barbarian tribe, why don’t you show yourselves?”</p> <p>Feeling a large amount of killing intent rushing past him, Yang Ling realized that while he could fool the average barbarian, he could not deceive the wily old fox that was the leader of the barbarians.</p> <p>Yang Ling had just exposed himself when a messenger beside the leader of the barbarians shivered. He told the leader in fear, “Chief, that’s him. His Magical Beasts destroyed everything!”</p> <p>After escaping with his life, the messenger of the barbarians had fearfully reported the situation to the leader. To him, Yang Ling, who could summon a large number of Magical Beasts to do battle, was a demon. In fact, he might even be more terrifying than a demon.</p> <p>“Horned Bee Beasts that have evolved to the second stage, hmph, so that’s why!” The leader of the barbarians was observant, quickly noticing traces of the Horned Bee Beasts and understanding the secret behind Casey’s power. He stared coldly at Yang Ling. “Just who are you, and why have you come here?”</p> <p>“I am Yang Ling, and the reason for me coming here is simple!” Yang Ling laughed coldly and said with a friendly tone, “Hand over your captives, then pay for my losses today, that’s all!”</p> <p>The leader of the barbarians had not said anything when a muscular warrior beside him howled, “Rubbish! Since you dare come here, don’t even think about leaving alive! Asking us to hand over our captives is even more ridiculous, hmph!”</p> <p>Seeing the barbarians who were all talk, Casey and Alice heaved a sigh of relief. Between the shadows of the trees and the story of the mysterious Summoner, it looked like Yang Ling had already struck fear in the hearts of the barbarians before this battle. Otherwise, if it were someone else, the leader of the barbarians might already have attacked them with an army.</p> <p>Casey and Alice sighed in relief, but the pagoda mark on Yang Ling’s forehead throbbed suddenly. Yang Ling exercised caution and immediately sent a team of Horned Bee Beasts to scout the surroundings. True enough, he soon realized that a large group of barbarians were sneaking over under the water. The other party was using a method of diversion.</p> <p>Advancing through an unknown path?</p> <p>Yang Ling let out a cold smile, quickly forming another idea. Since the barbarians were going to use sneaky tactics, he did not mind giving them a surprise.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, since this is the first time we are meeting, let me give you a present. You must accept it!” After hearing the report of the messenger and understanding that the barbarians responsible for the ambush were in position, the leader of the barbarians became confident. He shot a look to the guard beside him and the latter immediately threw a heavy bag toward Yang Ling.</p> <p>Out of curiosity, Casey took large steps forward and opened the bag. But his face quickly turned pale. He pointed to the barbarians, unable to say anything. Alice looked over in confusion and immediately screamed, her body shivering. In the bag were three bloody human heads, their eyes bulging. They had all died unjustly.</p> <p>“Great, great, great, this present is not bad!” Yang Ling laughed in fury. “I should return a gift. Since it’s the first time we are meeting, I’ll return a small gift to the tribe!”</p> <p>Eye for an eye, blood must be repaid with blood!</p> <p>After catching the scent of blood, the horde of Horned Bee Beasts became excited. If not for Yang Ling’s control, they would have charged toward the captured barbarians and started tearing their flesh. For revenge, and more to give a threat, Yang Ling did not mind giving the barbarians a display of the Horned Bee Beasts’ power.</p> <p>Under the confused gazes of the barbarians, Yang Ling softly clapped his hands. In that instant, a large group of Horned Bee Beasts flew out of the treetops and bushes. After circling the air for a moment, they charged toward the captured barbarians.</p> <p>“No… Save me!”</p> <p>“Chief, save us…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The captured barbarians struggled, but the Horned Bee Beasts latched onto them tightly, tearing away a large amount of flesh whenever they attacked. In the blink of an eye, some of the barbarians rolled on the ground in pain, their intestines spilling out. In fact, some even got devoured in an instant, leaving behind nothing but a few strands of hair.</p> <p>Seeing the hellish sight before them, hearing the pathetic cries of their clansmen, even the merciless barbarians felt their skin crawl. Even the leader of the barbarians was not spared. Yang Ling’s present was too shocking, and they did not expect that there would be someone more barbaric than them on this continent.</p> <p>“Hmph, let’s see who’ll have the last laugh!” The leader of the barbarians waved his arms after clenching his teeth. In that instant, a large group of barbarians emerged from under the water. They charged toward Yang Ling with their gleaming axes raised high.</p> <p>Caught off guard, Casey turned pale. He clenched his teeth and charged forward with his ax, determined. “Sir, leave and take Alice, quick!”</p> <p>“Sir, what are we going to do?” Alice was dazed. She looked helplessly at the large group of barbarians charging over, not noticing the large group of bloodthirsty Evil Eyes behind her.</p> <p>“It’ll be fine, don’t worry!” Yang Ling carried the scared Alice and said coldly, “There’s a solution to every problem. Since these barbarians are rushing to their deaths, then let us send them on their way!”</p> <p>At the same time, looking at the howling barbarians, Casey felt a mixture of emotions. To think that he would have to meet his maker so soon after being saved by Yang Ling. He so wanted to return home. But if he was to do this again, he would also charge forward without hesitation.</p> <p>“Kill!”</p> <p>Casey lifted the giant ax in his hands high in the air, but he had not struck downward when it happened! Pathetic cries rang out as the barbarians charging toward him were blasted into mush by a condensed webwork of light.</p>",
  "Chapter 13: Barbaric Negotiations": "<p>Seeing a large group of elite warriors obliterated in the blink of an eye, the barbarians were dumbfounded. Previously, they hadn’t really believed the barbarian who was lucky enough to escape, but now that they were witnessing it for themselves, they felt deeply the shock and terror brought about by the beams of light.</p> <p>Shocking, it was too shocking!</p> <p>Every barbarian present was petrified. To the mountain warriors, Evil Eyes were the weakest low level Magical Beasts in Terras Forest, with nonchalant personalities and slow movements. Even four or five of them attacking together was no match for a barbarian, much less one. They did not expect that the power of these useless Magical Beasts would become so terrifying after Yang Ling gathered them together.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, if this is the full extent of your abilities, I do not think that you will be able to destroy our entire tribe!” The leader of the barbarians swallowed hard. “Horned Bee Beasts that have evolved to the second stage can only launch three poisonous stingers a day. The magical powers of the Evil Eyes are also limited, and they cannot attack over a long period of time. As long as we stand guard over the castle, there’s no way your attack will be successful!”</p> <p>Even though they had suffered heavy casualties, the leader of the barbarians was unwilling to submit. Barbarians were natural warriors of the mountains. Since ancient times, there were only barbarians that died in battle. There were never barbarians that knelt and begged for mercy.</p> <p>“That’s right, I cannot take down your entire tribe!” Yang Ling admitted it honestly, much to everyone’s surprise. “But as long as the Magical Beast army under my command is standing guard outside of your tribe, there’s no way for you to hunt out in the forest. In that case, how long can you hide in your castle?”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling directly expose the weak point of the barbarian tribe, the eyelids of the barbarian leader twitched, sensing the unfavorable situation. He deliberated for a moment before saying, “Sir Yang, do not forget that this is the Terras Forest, and we are only a small branch tribe of barbarians. We can call upon the help of other barbarian tribes at any time!”</p> <p>“Haha, what a joke. Even if the other barbarian tribes are willing to help, when can they reach this place? Are they going to come here to clean up your corpses for you?”</p> <p>Yang Ling smiled coldly. After a pause, seeing the green-faced leader of the barbarians, he continued, “As an Ancient Summoner, I am merely a small fry in my family. As you can see, I can only control low level Magical Beasts like Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes. But my elders are different; the high level Magical Beasts can level your tribe with numbers alone, much less with their offensive capabilities. All I have to do is set up a Teleportation Spell, and they can provide reinforcements immediately!”</p> <p>Just as the leader of the barbarians had said, the magical powers of the Evil Eyes had been depleted after their continuous attacks. If a group of barbarians were to charge forward now, merely escaping unscathed would prove to be a problem. At the critical moment, Yang Ling had decided to take the risk and exaggerate his powers.</p> <p>Ancient Summoner? The leader of the barbarians had a shocking revelation, finally understanding why Yang Ling was able to summon so many Magical Beasts into battle.</p> <p>The leader of the barbarians was confused when he looked at Yang Ling and his cold smile. He could not understand how he had offended a terrifying person like him. Even though the barbarians were violent, they had been living in the Terras Forest for thousands of years, and they understood more than anyone how terrifying Ancient Summoners could be.</p> <p>According to the records of their clan, a long time ago, there was a powerful barbarian empire on the continent, its borders vast beyond imagination. But the twenty-eighth king unknowingly offended a mysterious, powerful family of Ancient Summoners. The Ancient Summoners then summoned a horde of Magical Beasts to invade the kingdom, massacring the entire royal family in just a night. In the end, the barbarian empire became overrun, its power declining over time. The barbarians slowly exited the main stage of the continent and became recluses within the forests.</p> <p>How could the leader of the barbarians dare to act rashly, if even a mighty barbarian empire was no much for a family of Ancient Summoners? The leader of the barbarians felt his skin crawl just thinking about the powerhouse behind Yang Ling. After repeatedly weighing the pros and cons, in order to ensure the continuity of the clan, all he could do was give up on the idea of defending the area. He said uneasily, “Sir Yang, might I ask why you have come to our tribe?”</p> <p>“Simple, I have said it before. I’ll call off my troops after you have released your captives and paid us for our losses!”</p> <p>“Alright!” The leader of the barbarians was forthright, immediately nodding his head. He instructed his guards loudly, “Release all the captives immediately, quickly!”</p> <p>After receiving the order, a few of the barbarians left quickly. Soon after, they brought out a large group of captives, young and old. Among them was Alice’s grandfather.</p> <p>“Grandpa, Alice can finally see you again, Grandpa…”</p> <p>Seeing the familiar figure, Alice charged forward without a care in the world. To be reunited after such a crisis, the pair huddled together and cried. At the same time, the rest of the captives shed tears, all thankful to Yang Ling for saving them.</p> <p>“Good, chief, since you were going to do that anyway, why be so violent in the first place?” Looking at the uneasy leader of the barbarians, it was as if Yang Ling saw an extremely fat lamb, ready for slaughter. He smiled. “Now, let me calculate our compensation. Ten Purple Crystal Coins for every injured human captive, twenty for every dead. Is that fair?”</p> <p>“Alright, count it as twenty for every person!” The barbarian leader agreed readily. All he wanted to do now was to send the plague that was Yang Ling away as soon as possible. He would have paid fifty Purple Crystal Coins per person, much less twenty.</p> <p>After counting the numbers of human captives and consolidating the total amount to be paid, Yang Ling smiled and said, “Chief, the compensation for the captives has been calculated, a total of two thousand five hundred Purple Crystal Coins. Now let’s talk about compensation to me. Five hundred Purple Crystal Coins for every Magical Beast, a total of twelve. We can count my effort as twenty-five thousand Purple Crystal Coins. As for my mental strain, that’s fifty thousand coins. So the total would be eighty thousand Purple Crystal Coins!”</p> <p>Eighty thousand Purple Crystal Coins?</p> <p>Even Casey and the rest were dumbfounded when they heard the number, much less the barbarians. The teary captives even suspected that they were dreaming! A few moments ago, they had just been despairing in the jail of the barbarians. Now, they had not only escaped with their lives, they might even receive sums of money as compensation.</p> <p>“You…” The leader of the barbarians was furious. He had expected Yang Ling to ask for a little extra as compensation, but he hadn’t thought that the Ancient Summoner would extort him, using his so-called “mental strain” as an excuse to ask for eighty thousand Purple Crystal Coins.</p> <p>Could he be using this as an excuse to continue his attack on the tribe?</p> <p>After taking in a deep breath, the leader of the barbarians changed his expression. He tried his hardest to cover up his unease and thought about something terrifying. After hesitating for a moment, he said, “Sir Yang, to tell you the truth, we do not come into contact with the outside world very much. We only have at most two thousand Purple Crystal Coins in the tribe!”</p> <p>“Sigh, that’s troublesome!” Yang Ling pretended to be having an internal struggle. “Do you have any specialty items, like Essence Crystals of Magical Beasts or Dark Fire Crystals? Even though there’s not a good market for them, they are still worth some money!”</p> <p>After listening to Yang Ling, the leader of the barbarians heaved a sigh of relief. He realized that Yang Ling was only after wealth. He then creased his brows. As powerful mountain warriors, they had indeed gathered a decent amount of Magical Beast Essence Crystals over the years. But it might not satisfy Yang Ling’s appetite even if they brought all of the crystals out.</p> <p>“Chief, it is understandable that you cannot cough up enough coins or Essence Crystals in such a short amount of time!” Yang Ling gave a friendly smile after seeing the barbarian leader crease his brows. “You have a large number of brave warriors and can take the time to hunt Essence Crystals or dig for Dark Fire Crystals to settle your debt. I can extend the deadline for you!”</p> <p>Yang Ling deployed the offer as bait. There were many Dark Fire Crystals in Valenia Valley, and the barbarians were strong and powerful. They would make excellent laborers. Other than that, the barbarians were notorious within these parts, and their appearance was ferocious. No one would dare mess with them.</p> <p>With such bait, Yang Ling and the leader of the barbarians signed a seemingly fair contract. The barbarians would provide Yang Ling with a hundred Magical Beast Essence Crystals and two full carts of Dark Fire Crystals once a month for a total of two years. Yang Ling would generously release the rest of the captured barbarians and promise to supply the barbarians with essentials such as salt.</p> <p>After saying goodbye to the leader of the barbarians, Yang Ling led the satisfied group south, toward the tribe of forest elves. Along the way, the people who survived the crisis were joyful, repeatedly thanking Yang Ling for saving them.</p> <p>Yang Ling had returned satisfied, but a giant storm was brewing in a magnificent castle in Wissen Town, a thousand miles away from the forest.</p> <p>“Yiblis, don’t be so rough, ouch…” Ymir was sprawled on the bed, his hand resting against his bloody butt that had been torn into shreds by the Horned Bee Beasts. He kicked the old man. “Scram, get a maid in to help change the medicine!”</p> <p>Ymir had been unable to sit ever since the battle against the elf tribe. His buttocks were swollen and torn, and his temper was becoming worse and worse.</p> <p>“Goode, gather all of the warriors immediately. I want to bathe the elf tribe in blood. I want to tear out the brains of that Summoner!”</p> <p>“Young master, this…” Goode, who was dressed fully in black, was put in an awkward position. He chose his words carefully. “Half a month ago, the master took a large group of elite warriors to see. It does not seem to be a good opportunity for revenge!”</p> <p>“I don’t care! I want to kill that detestable Summoner, and I want to sell all those elves to the most wretched brothel!” Ymir roared as he punched the bed under him. He had never experienced such a humiliation growing up. The warriors he had brought along with him were exterminated. He had almost lost his life.</p> <p>Seeing the agitated Ymir, the strategist Goode hesitated for a moment. “Young master, through my efforts, I have managed to establish a secret correspondence with a member of a guild of assassins. What if we…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>After a secret discussion, Goode silently left the room while Ymir laughed heartily. He slipped his hand into the blouse of the maid and pinched her supple breasts.</p>",
  "Chapter 14: Date with a Female Assassin": "<p>Along the way to the elf tribe, Yang Ling conversed with the group of people and learned more about their difficulties. Most of them had fallen into traps set up by the barbarians when they took the risk of hunting in the Terras Forest. There was also a small group of them who were captured by the barbarians while they were on the outskirts of the forest. These people included Alice and her grandfather.</p> <p>“I heard that the Anca family in Wissen Town is very powerful and loves to do good deeds. Why did they not do anything against the brazen barbarians?” After realizing that most of the people here came from Wissen Town, Yang Ling asked a question he already knew the answer to. He wanted to learn more about the Anca family from them.</p> <p>“Hmph, the evil Anca family has harmed many people!” Alice’s grandfather clenched his teeth. “My name is Brulis. I was the owner of a small wood processing factory in the town. Even though I was not rich, I could still get by. But the Anca family saw how well my factory was doing and employed a scheme, destroying my family. I encountered the barbarians after Alice and I luckily escaped from their clutches…”</p> <p>Brulis had tears in his eyes as he thought about his family. He hugged Alice tightly, the only family he had left.</p> <p>“That’s right. Sir, what you do not know is that there are no atrocities that the Anca family would not commit. If not for their extortions, why would we risk our lives and hunt deep in the forest?”</p> <p>Seeing the pitiful Brulis, Casey also started narrating his story, his eyes harboring a seething fury. Then, the rest of the group also told Yang Ling about their lives. The evil Anca family were the masterminds of all their suffering. They cursed Ymir and his ancestors, and they cursed the descendants of the Anca family to all die tragic deaths.</p> <p>Through his indirect questions, Yang Ling understood that the Anca family was in control of over thirty percent of the wealth in Wissen Town. They not only had over five hundred servants, they also had dozens of terrifying gryphons. They were the most powerful organization in Wissen Town. Because of their rampant extortions, the townspeople were all extremely unsatisfied with the Anca family, but they could not do anything about it because the Anca family was too powerful.</p> <p>After thinking for a moment, Yang Ling came up with a preliminary plan. Even though the Anca family was powerful, they had many enemies. Yang Ling might be able to attack them using the conflict between the Anca family and the townspeople. Rather than wait for Ymir to attack them with his army, it would be better to strike first. After all, with the large numbers of Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes guarding him, as well as the gryphon and its speed, he should be able to escape unscathed even if the attack failed.</p> <p>When they reached the elf tribe, the humans were treated well by the elves, mostly due to the respect the elves had for Yang Ling. Sofia was very busy, sometimes arranging food and lodging for the people, and other times leading a few healers to heal the injured with their Regeneration Spells.</p> <p>After satisfying his hunger, Yang Ling went on a stroll in the forest alone. Over these last few days, he was becoming more and more certain that he had unintentionally stumbled into another universe. There were no planes or cannons here, nor were there televisions or the internet; but there were powerful and mysterious spellcasters, a primordial forest spanning thousands of miles, as well as beautiful girls of different races…</p> <p>“Should I marry a few elf beauties and give birth to a bunch of mixed blood kids?” Yang Ling let out a bitter laugh as he recalled Sofia and her bright, large eyes, as well as her slender waist.</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was in a daze, he suddenly heard the sound of something slicing through the air. An arrow was flying through the air, aimed directly at his chest. Following that, a dark shadow charged over with a silver dagger in hand.</p> <p>At the critical moment, Yang Ling jumped to the side, twisting his waist to avoid the fast arrow. He then fell and rolled on the ground, causing the dagger to miss its target.</p> <p>“Who are you?”</p> <p>Yang Ling stood up, staring straight at the masked person. He felt as though he had become the target of a poisonous snake, not daring to move. At the same time, he was sending a silent emergency message to the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes at the elf tribe.</p> <p>“Even if I do not kill you, there will be others who will do it. All you need to know is that your head is now worth a thousand Purple Crystal Coins.” The masked person spoke with an icy tone.</p> <p>Yang Ling did not dare be careless, but the masked assassin was more nervous than he was. This was her first solo operation, and if she failed, she would be severely punished by the association. The intelligence she received described Yang Ling as a powerful Summoner, but she did not expect his physical skills to be more nimble than a thief’s. He had easily avoided her meticulously planned attack.</p> <p>After clenching her teeth, the masked assassin waved her dagger and charged forward. They were not far from the elf tribe, and her opponent was a mysterious, powerful Summoner. The situation would become more and more unfavorable for her the more time passed.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, Yang Ling chose to advance, charging forward with his bare fists. He understood that against a speedy assassin, running away in a panic would make his death even more swift. Furthermore, he had gained great strength and nimble movements after cultivating the mysterious Wizard Mantra. He believed that he would be able to last in combat until his Magical Beasts came to reinforce him.</p> <p>Cautiously, Yang Ling fought the masked person. The masked person had a dagger in hand and used merciless techniques, each strike aiming for Yang Ling’s vital points. But Yang Ling was more nimble and had more strength. His fists cut the wind with strength.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, where are you?” Just as their battle approached a stalemate, an anxious cry rang from nearby.</p> <p>Hearing the shout approach them, the masked person trembled and increased the speed of her attacks. Yang Ling let out a bitter smile. Why did Sofia have to come now of all times? It would be troublesome if she were to encounter the partners of this masked assassin.</p> <p>Clenching his teeth, Yang Ling bore the brunt of his opponent’s kick and charged forward, returning a fierce kick to the masked person’s right arm. He removed the threat of the dagger and pressed down on the other party before pulling away their mask.</p> <p>“Oh, you… A female assassin?” Yang Ling was at a loss when he saw the assassin’s long lashes and blonde hair. He did not expect the masked assassin to be such a beautiful lady.</p> <p>He had not noticed it when they were battling, but now that he was pressing down on the female assassin, he felt the curves of his opponent’s body. At the same time, he caught a whiff of an intoxicating fragrance. Looking at the woman’s fair, sexy neck at such a close distance, feeling her warm, supple skin, Yang Ling quickly had a normal male reaction.</p> <p>“Die, pervert!”</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was about to knock her out with a punch, the female assassin suddenly pushed with her right hand, the ring on her index finger slicking along his throat.</p> <p>The ring of the female assassin was dark and shiny, obviously coated with a layer of poison. Other than that, there was a cold light reflecting off the ring, its silhouette sharp. Yang Ling knew that if his reactions had been a second slower, there would have definitely been a life-threatening wound along his throat.</p> <p>After rolling away, the female assassin struck down with her leg without waiting for Yang Ling to stand. The look she gave and her clenched teeth seemed to reflect her desire to dismember Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Haha, great attack!” Yang Ling was no longer flustered now that there was no threat of a dagger. He twisted his body and avoided the female assassin’s attack, then grabbed her soft right leg. The female assassin struggled in shock, but she hadn’t expected her shoe to remain in Yang Ling’s hand even after she successfully pulled her right leg back.</p> <p>“Hmph, you have avoided death this time, but you’ll not avoid it the second time!”</p> <p>After her attack was blocked, the female assassin heard Sofia’s approaching footsteps and understood that she had already missed the optimal opportunity. She gritted her teeth and retreated decisively. She turned to glare at Yang Long before vanishing into the forest.</p> <p>Seeing how speedy the female assassin was, Yang Ling did not give chase. After all, who knew if there were any ambushes deeper in the forest?</p> <p>“Brother Yang, who was that woman just now?” The female assassin had just left when Sofia rushed over anxiously. “Oh, what a slender, petite shoe! Where did you get this? Could it be…”</p> <p>“Sofia, why have you come here? Be careful of encountering the female assassin and her partners!” Yang Ling shook her head as he looked at Sofia breathing heavily. If she had carelessly encountered the partner of the assassin just now, it would have been disastrous.</p> <p>Female assassin?</p> <p>Was there a female assassin in this world that would give the target she was assassinating one shoe? Sofia clearly did not believe Yang Ling’s weak excuse. She had a faint idea of what was going on.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, I was too reckless. I disrupted your date!”</p> <p>Seeing the petite shoe in Yang Ling’s hand, then thinking about the figure of the woman in black escaping into the forest, Sofia felt a sense of loss. Her nose twitched as she turned around and began running back to the tribe.</p> <p>Tonight, she had wanted to spend some time alone with Yang Ling after seeing that he had left by himself. But she did not expect to encounter Yang Ling going on a date with another woman.</p> <p>Date?</p> <p>A date with a female assassin?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head as he looked at Sofia, who had run away crying. He let out a self-mocking smile. “This date… It sure is out of the ordinary!”</p>",
  "Chapter 15: Tree Shepherd": "<p>After the incident with the female assassin, Yang Ling returned to the elf tribe and fell asleep immediately. Even though he knew that Sofia had misunderstood him, it would be difficult to explain the situation fully. Since it was hard to explain, and further explanation would feel too much like an excuse, he decided to let fate take the wheel for the time being.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling could not find his way back to Earth, he had decided to adapt to this environment, rather than grumble all day long.</p> <p>His life was currently leaping from the frying pan into the fire; but since he was already in mid-air, he might as well enjoy the heat from the flames. As he was falling asleep, Yang Ling recalled that classic sentence he had seen on the internet a few years ago.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling was a little surprised that Ymir would employ an assassin to take his life, he did not become overly fearful. After all, what was going to come would come regardless of what he did. The only way to deal with this was to quickly increase his abilities. This was similar to how one would never know what beast one would come across when hunting in the forest; only hunters who were strong enough could survive the repeated attacks.</p> <p>Sofia is beautiful. It seems… that female assassin was beautiful too!</p> <p>Yang Ling recalled Sofia’s large, glistening eyes and her slender, huggable waist. The scene soon changed into the female assassin’s icy cold face.</p> <p>Some time later, Yang Ling heard a fleeting tune in his daze. Amidst the rustling of the trees, he could faintly hear the cries of a young girl. The sounds also seemed to be the incantations of a priest in prayer.</p> <p>After listening intently to the sound, Yang Ling silently headed in the direction where the sound was coming from. Stepping on the dew covered grass and making his way past a clear stream, he arrived at a vast pine forest.</p> <p>Sofia, who was dressed in white, walked around a majestic tree barefoot. She was silently muttering something using the ancient language of the elves. It sounded like a folk song of the elf tribes, but also like she was whispering something toward the ancient tree. Her eyes were watery, tears falling after every round.</p> <p>Be it coincidence or an illusion, Yang Ling felt the ancient tree creak with every tear Sofia dropped, as if it was responding to Sofia.</p> <p>“Sofia!” Yang Ling could not help but shout when he saw the pitiful elf girl and her tear-covered face.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, you… Why are you here?” After wiping the tears off her face, Sofia quickly stopped circling the tree, her face red.</p> <p>“I dreamed of a beautiful woman just now and heard your song!” Yang Ling smiled and walked over with large strides. He sat beside Sofia. “So, beautiful elf lady, you spoiled my dreams. Tell me, how are you going to compensate me for my losses?”</p> <p>“Compensate, my foot!” Sofia blushed when she saw how Yang Ling was joking with her. She hesitated for a moment before silently asking, “What are you doing out here so late at night? Are you not going to accompany the woman you are dating?”</p> <p>Dating?</p> <p>Seeing Sofia’s teary eyes, Yang Ling seemed to have understood something. He shook his head and laughed bitterly. “Sofia, that woman was an assassin, and I nearly died in her hands earlier. Which part of that sounds like a date?”</p> <p>“Hmph, you humans are all the same. You men are all more of a casanova than Hasmere!” Sofia’s eyes were red, clearly not believing Yang Ling. What female assassin would give her target her petite shoe? It was rumored that humans were incredibly flirtatious and would often look at other ladies despite having a beautiful wife. It looked like those rumors were true.</p> <p>Lies were more believable than truths, and it looked like that was the same for both worlds.</p> <p>After shaking his head and letting out a bitter smile, Yang Ling understood that he was going to make the situation worse if he explained himself further. He quickly changed the subject. “If this tree truly has spiritual qualities, then you spinning around it like that would surely make it giddy, even if you are not!”</p> <p>“Giddy my foot!” Sofia burst into laughter. “This is the oldest tree in our tribe, having over eight thousand years of history. Even though it is unable to nurture Withered Tree Guardians, it has the highest spiritual qualities. It can understand whatever I tell it!”</p> <p>An ancient tree with spiritual qualities?</p> <p>Seeing Sofia lean toward the ancient tree as she was explaining it, Yang Ling became excited, also leaning over. Suddenly, an indescribable ripple spread toward him from the tree. The ripples resonated with the rhythm of his heartbeats, as if it was saying something.</p> <p>A spirit born from an ancient tree?</p> <p>Yang Ling recalled the ghost stories he had heard when he was young, and he suddenly had an idea. The mysterious wizard techniques could tame Magical Beasts; they might work on tree or mountain spirits too.</p> <p>Secretly, Yang Ling bit on his right index finger and pressed it down on the tree. In that instant, the wound seemed to have come into contact with a bottomless pit, his blood and wizard powers flowing out like the Yellow River.</p> <p>“Ah, Yang Ling, what happened to you?”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling trembling and turning pale, Sofia shouted in shock. But just as she was about to step forward and support him, Yang Ling let out a low grunt and swallowed a bunch of blood red orbs he had taken out of his robes. Following which, the giant tree vanished without a trace.</p> <p>In his daze, Yang Ling once again unintentionally arrived at the mysterious space of the Wizard’s Pagoda. All he saw was a giant tree in front of the tall Wizard’s Pagoda. Groups of Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes were circling the tree. Some of them even climbed straight up the trunk of the tree, resting peacefully on its branches.</p> <p>The tree had lush, green leaves. For some reason, Yang Ling felt a sense of familiarity. He walked over and softly stroked the bark of the giant tree. Quickly, an indescribable ripple spread from the trunk of the tree, as if it wanted to express something.</p> <p>Before Yang Ling could make sense of the ripples, his mind suddenly jolted. His consciousness slowly slipped out of the mysterious space. When he opened his eyes, he saw that the elf elder had rushed over to where they were. The magic staff in his hands was releasing a pale green light, as if he had just cast a spell.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, are you alright!” Sofia finally heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Yang Ling open his eyes. She did not understand how the giant tree could have vanished without a trace, nor did he understand why Yang Ling would be rendered unconscious. In her panic, she had rushed to the tribe and informed her grandfather.</p> <p>Seeing the huge crater where the ancient giant tree used to be, then recalling the giant tree he saw in the mysterious space, Yang Ling had a thought. He instinctively formed a hand gesture. In the blink of an eye, a Withered Tree Guardian about twenty meters tall appeared before him, a giant club in its hands.</p> <p>“Lebrock pays respects to its master!” Just as the crowd was in shock, the Withered Tree Guardian knelt before Yang Ling, tossing up a large amount of dirt. Its deafening voice nearly shattered the eardrums of those present.</p> <p>Unlike the Withered Tree Guardians Sofia summoned, the giant groveling thing before Yang Ling had countless green shoots sprouting from its body. Its watermelon-sized eyes had a soulful glow. Those, coupled with its rippling, granite-like muscles, made it look incredibly sturdy.</p> <p>“Oh lord, a Withered Tree Warrior with spiritual qualities!” The elf elder let out a shocked shout as he pointed at Yang Ling. “Yang Ling, you… you are a Tree Shepherd?”</p>",
  "Chapter 16: Withered Tree Warriors": "<p>Yang Ling got the gist of the situation after listening to the elf elder’s explanation.</p> <p>It turned out that there were mysterious, powerful Tree Shepherds that had existed in ancient times. They were able to summon Withered Tree Warriors from ancient trees. To them, forests that were sprawled with ancient trees were their territory, the source of their powers. They could instantly conjure countless Withered Tree Warriors to do battle for them.</p> <p>Ancient Summoner, Tree Shepherd…</p> <p>The elf elder’s heart shook when his gaze moved from the Withered Tree Warrior kneeling on the ground to the mysterious Yang Ling.</p> <p>Ancient Summoners could summon large numbers of Magical Beasts to do battle and create a terrifying Magical Beast army; Tree Shepherds weren’t worse off, able to summon countless Withered Tree Warriors from within the ancient trees. The elf elder could not imagine how powerful Yang Ling’s battle abilities would be in the future, now that he knew that Yang Ling possessed both those powers.</p> <p>The Terras Forest spanned ten thousand miles. To its south was the ocean, to its west the vast Banto Empire and prosperous Livenza Alliance. To the north, past a wide marsh, was the powerful Rossi Empire. The east of the forest seemed to span on and on, and no one really knew how large Terras Forest really was.</p> <p>There were tall, ancient trees in all corners of this forest. In other words, Yang Ling could summon thousands of Withered Tree Warriors similar to Lebrock. Coupled with the various Magical Beasts existing within the area, the elf elder realized that in this huge primordial forest, Yang Ling was at his most powerful. As long as he was willing to help the elf tribe, they wouldn’t have to fear even the attacks of a hundred Ymirs.</p> <p>“This vast forest is home to us forest elves. It is also the home and source of power of the Tree Shepherds. Legend has it that in ancient times, each Tree Shepherd lorded over a territory spanning thousands of miles and lived in harmony with us forest elves. We forest elves would be responsible for nurturing and growing ancient trees, while the Tree Shepherds would summon Withered Tree Warriors to protect us in times of need.”</p> <p>After getting over his shock, the elf elder slowly started narrating the ancient legend. The forest elves had lived on this continent for millennia. Their long historical records were filled with stories of Tree Shepherds.</p> <p>“Yes, a win-win situation!” Yang Ling immediately understood what the elf elder meant when he narrated the legend of elves and Tree Shepherds helping each other. But this, to him, was a foreign land. It would be a good idea to form a partnership with the elves.</p> <p>In this world, where the law of the jungle reigned supreme, having powerful abilities was of utmost importance. Otherwise, it might not even be possible for him to be a beggar in peace, much less enjoy life.</p> <p>Even though the arrow techniques of the forest elves were unparalleled, their close-combat abilities were decent at best. This weakness had been made apparent when they became flustered as soon as they had to engage in close distance combat with Ymir and his gryphons. In such a situation, the powerful Withered Tree Warriors would be their trump card. If they had a large horde of Withered Tree Warriors, Ymir might not even dare to step into Terras Forest, much less exact revenge on the tribe.</p> <p>The two parties came to an agreement.</p> <p>After successfully keeping Yang Ling on his side, the elf elder saw how Yang Ling was glancing at Sofia from time to time, as well as Sofia’s blushing face. He had a joy when he recalled how the two were secretly together that late into the night. If he could marry Sofia to Yang Ling, it would do much good for the tribe. With a Tree Shepherd protecting them, the safety of the tribe would be guaranteed.</p> <p>After a moment, the experienced elf elder left together with the crowd, giving Yang Ling and Sofia some alone time.</p> <p>“Sofia…”</p> <p>“Yes…”</p> <p>“The weather seems to have become colder!”</p> <p>“Yes…”</p> <p>Both Yang Ling and Sofia understood the elder’s intentions after seeing him leave. In that moment, Yang Ling did not know what he should say. Sofia was so shy that she did not even lift her head.</p> <p>“Lebrock, stand up!”</p> <p>Yang Ling’s imagination went wild after he commanded the groveling Withered Tree Warrior to rise. He looked at its apartment-sized club and its towering muscles. A Withered Tree Guardian that did not have sentience was already more powerful than a tank, so Yang Ling could not imagine what kind of destructive capabilities a sentient warrior would have.</p> <p>Looking at the soulful Lebrock, Sofia said in envy, “Yang Ling, Lebrock is a Withered Tree Warrior with spiritual qualities. It can evolve quickly as long as it absorbs an adequate amount of magical power from the surroundings. It is much more powerful than the Withered Tree Guardians our tribe has nurtured painstakingly.”</p> <p>It can quickly evolve as long as it absorbs an adequate amount of magical power from the surroundings?</p> <p>Ever since he came into contact with the mysterious Wizard Mantra, Yang Ling noticed that the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes he tamed would evolve with the increase of his own wizard powers. If what Sofia said was true and a tamed tree spirit could also evolve, it would be wonderful indeed.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s confusion, Sofia gave a more detailed explanation. It turned out that forest elves, having lived in the forest for generations, were adept in natural magic and could boost the growth of trees. As long as they were persistent, they could summon Withered Tree Guardians from those trees when the time was right.</p> <p>But Lebrock, who was filled with spiritual qualities, was different. The Withered Tree Guardians that were nurtured by the elves had no intelligence, and their movements were slow. It was even harder for them to evolve. Furthermore, the time needed to nurture them was long, and thus most elf tribes only had a few in their possession.</p> <p>“So why are plants sprouting from Lebrock’s body?”</p> <p>“Yang Ling, the sprouts on Lebrock’s body mean that its power is that of regeneration. Even if it were to suffer severe injuries, it could slowly recover as long as it hadn’t stopped breathing!”</p> <p>As Sofia explained, Yang Ling found out that the Withered Tree Warriors summoned by Tree Shepherds all possessed unique powers from birth. For example, Withered Tree Warriors that were born from evergreens such as pine trees would have powers of regeneration, and Withered Tree Warriors born from hardier trees would have steel-like skin, resistant to blades and cannons.</p> <p>Surprised, Yang Ling instructed a Horned Bee Beast to bite Lebrock’s body. Indeed, the blood stopped flowing instantly from the deep wound and started to regenerate. He was a champion fighter that practically could not die.</p> <p>After understanding how powerful the Withered Tree Warriors were, Yang Ling quickly put away the towering Lebrock and returned to the tribe with Sofia. He started searching for ancient trees before dawn, hoping to quickly enhance his abilities. The attacks of his Evil Eyes were powerful, but they lacked defensive abilities. His Horned Bee Beasts were adept in stealth attacks, but they could not launch effective attacks against a group of experienced spellcasters. What he lacked now were powerful subordinates like Lebrock.</p> <p>There more ancient trees than anything else around the elf tribe. But what disappointed Yang Ling was the fact that he only found five trees with spiritual qualities after half a day of searching. What was even more frustrating was that even after using all his wizard powers and blood essences, he could only tame one Withered Tree Warrior a day.</p> <p>After understanding Yang Ling’s troubles, the elf elder did not hesitate to take on the mission of helping Yang Ling find ancient trees. He sent out all of his priests. At the same time, he sent messengers to elf tribes around them in hopes that they would help search for ancient trees with spiritual qualities. He also hoped that he could obtain Water of the Spring of Life to help Yang Ling increase his wizard powers.</p> <p>The elf elder understood that increasing Yang Ling’s powers was akin to increasing the powers of his tribe, and thus spared no effort in helping him.</p> <p>The Water of the Spring of Life could rapidly enhance Yang Ling’s abilities, but he had already exhausted the Water of the Spring of Life his tribe had saved over the years. He could only depend on the other elf tribes now. The elf elder believed that after they realized Yang Ling’s identity as a Tree Shepherd, they would definitely not be stingy with the Water of the Spring of Life they had. After all, the appeal of the Withered Tree Warriors to the elf tribes was too high.</p> <p>In the following days, other than taming ancient trees with spiritual qualities, Yang Ling spent most of his time commanding his Magical Beast army to hunt for him, crystallizing the prey’s blood essences for his own consumption. Without the Water of the Spring of Life, consuming the blood essences of Magical Beasts was the fastest way to increase his wizard powers. At the same time, he could also develop the coordination between the Withered Tree Warriors, Horned Bee Beasts, and Evil Eyes.</p> <p>Ever since he tamed the Withered Tree Warriors, Yang Ling noticed that the dark red wizard powers in his body were now mixed with a shred of green. His training became faster and more effective. Every time he meditated in the treetops, he could feel a massive amount of spirit energy entering his body; at the same time, the trees and grass around him would release streaks of green energy, which seeped into his body through his skin.</p> <p>A month later, Yang Ling had control of a full fifteen powerful Withered Tree Warriors. Amongst them, ten were Pine Warriors with regeneration abilities, while the other five were Hardwood Warriors with impenetrable skin. At the same time, his wizard powers had also increased by leaps and bounds. He could now tame two ancient trees with spiritual qualities a day, and he had arrived at the last stage of the Blood Wizard. With a little more effort, he believed that he could soon arrive at the stage of the Spirit Wizard.</p>",
  "Chapter 17: Wheat Beer as a Reward": "<p>Yang Ling paused his search for ancient trees after scouring the area in a five hundred kilometer radius from the elf tribe.</p> <p>There were not many ancient trees in the outer portions of the forest, and he, for the time being, wasn’t powerful enough to delve into the deeper parts of the Terras Forest where higher level Magical Beasts lurked. Both the records kept by the elves as well as the memories of the Horned Bee Beasts told him that the Magical Beasts in the deepest parts of the forest were all powerful beyond imagination. Without sufficient abilities, he would not even last a second before them.</p> <p>At the same time, according to the intelligence brought back by a scout, there was an increasing number of unidentified troops gathering in Wissen Town. As a precaution against Ymir’s fatal attack, Yang Ling decided to head to the town himself to gather information.</p> <p>After sufficient preparation, Yang Ling rode his gryphon to Wissen Town, situated at the outskirts of the Terras Forest. Even as he went on the journey, he did not forget to train his Magical Beast army. Even though the Evil Eyes had put up a stellar performance against the barbarians, the battle had also revealed a fatal flaw, greatly diminishing their effectiveness.</p> <p>Horned Bee Beasts that had evolved to the second level could only shoot three poison stingers a day. Similar to this, unevolved Evil Eyes had limited magical powers and could only shoot ten bolts of light a day. On the battlefield, if he was unable to end the battle even after exhausting the Evil Eyes’ magical powers, then the only fate that awaited him was a massacre. Thus, increasing the hit rate of the beams was of utmost importance.</p> <p>As a mid level Magical Beast, the gryphon was incredibly fast. Its stamina was also much better than that of the Horned Bee Beasts, and it was able to traverse a thousand miles in a day. Two days later, Yang Ling had successfully arrived at Wissen Town.</p> <p>Wissen Town was not large, and the houses there generally made of wood and had simple designs. It had narrow streets with little shops. Most of the shops were wood processing factories. But what surprised Yang Ling was that there was a bar in a dark building. Upon entering the bar, he realized that there were quite a number of people there, mostly drunkards.</p> <p>“Sir, do you need any special services?”</p> <p>Yang Ling had just entered the bar when a young lady in heavy makeup leaned over. She was dressed revealingly, her slender legs peeking through her translucent skirt. Her cleavage was exposed from time to time.</p> <p>“No need, just get me two cups of beer!” Having frequented bars for many years, Yang Ling immediately guessed the lady’s line of work. It looked like there were men wherever there was alcohol, and these ladies would be present wherever a large number of men were. It was the same for both worlds.</p> <p>“Sir, all you need are a few crystal coins, and you’d have a wonderful time!” The young lady looked flirtatiously at Yang Ling and leaned over. “Could it be that Dulis is not beautiful enough for you?”</p> <p>Yang Ling was tempted. Looking at her voluptuous figure, he suddenly had a crooked thought. The mysterious wizard powers can tame Magical Beasts as well as ancient tree spirits… Perhaps I can get myself a female servant if I dropped a drop of blood onto a woman!</p> <p>Taming a female servant that would obey his every wish?</p> <p>As a cold breeze blew, Yang Ling shook off that insane idea. For some reason, he had lately found it hard to control certain areas of his personality. Perhaps it had something to do with practicing the mysterious Wizard Mantra. He would often dream of the suited lady that he had been squeezed behind on the public bus that day.</p> <p>Taking in a deep breath, Yang Ling quickly calmed himself down. He lightly pushed away the young lady. Wissen Town was Ymir’s base of operations. There were many threats here, so this was not the time for pleasure. He had to obtain information about the general situation.</p> <p>After freeing himself from the harassment of the lady, Yang Ling found a seat in the corner of the bar. He silently observed his surroundings. Not far away from him, two men who looked like troops were muttering something incessantly, quickly attracting Yang Ling’s attention.</p> <p>“Hey, Gullit, I heard that there are some new women who just arrived. Have you tried them out?”</p> <p>“Yiblis, it’s twenty Black Crystal Coins per session, that’s daylight robbery. But they sure are flirtatious… Tsk tsk, Fenlist, you shouldn’t miss it. They are definitely better than the old hag you have back at home!” A muscular man licked his lips. He was wearing torn armor, as if he was a defeated soldier.</p> <p>Fenlist gulped down his wheat beer and slammed the cup onto the table. “D*mn it, business is getting harder nowadays. I wouldn’t even have twenty crystal coins if I sold my underwear!”</p> <p>“Don’t complain about being poor here. You just accepted a mission, so how could you not have money?”</p> <p>“I get angry just talking about it. That mission was hard as h*ll, yet I only received a fifth of the reward. That b*stard Ymir, those b*stards in the Anca family, d*mn it, I can’t live like this anymore!”</p> <p>The thief Fenlist was angry. He had risked his life on a dangerous mission a few days back, but was soon noticed by one of the lackeys of the Anca family. The “protection money” they requested took away the bulk of his earnings.</p> <p>After looking around in a fluster, Gullit raised his index finger. “Shhh, lower your voice! Are you asking for death? If a lackey of the Anca family heard this, you might lose another portion of your finger!”</p> <p>After taking another mouthful of his beer, the thief Fenlist’s eyes became red. Half a year ago, Ymir had chopped off a good portion of his right ring finger because he had not paid his dues on time. Because of that, his right hand was no longer as nimble as it had been. His business suffered, and his life became harder.</p> <p>Seeing Fenlist’s rage, Gullit understood that he had touched on a sensitive topic. “Brother, let’s not talk about that anymore. Come, let’s drink! Oh right, you thieves have excellent sources of information. I heard that someone found a giant dragon’s cave deep in the Terras Forest, is that true?”</p> <p>“Gullit, I’ll admit this to you, I don’t really know!” Fenlist hesitated for a moment before whispering, “But there have been many new people in the town lately, some of them great swordsmen in heavy armor, some powerful spellcasters. I heard that the Church also sent a Divine Knight and a powerful Spellcaster. It looks like this is hardly a rumor!”</p> <p>“A Divine Knight from the Church? No wonder the Anca family has been exercising so much restraint recently!”</p> <p>The lackeys of the Anca family had been exercising surprising restraint recently, not causing trouble in Wissen Town every single day. It looked like even the evil Anca family was afraid of offending a knight of the Church.</p> <p>Yang Ling thought for a moment after he overheard their conversation, then smiled as he approached them. “Hey, do you two mind drinking with me? I’ll treat! Waiter, get us three glasses of good beer!”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling approach them, the two men cautiously stopped talking. As for the thief Fenlist, he was still silently muttering something.</p> <p>“Meeting like this requires some amount of fate. Come my two friends, cheers!” Yang Ling passionately raised his cup.</p> <p>After unintentionally obtaining information about the dragon’s cave and the people of the Church, Yang Ling realized that this had not been a wasted trip. He realized that the Anca family would not dare openly seek revenge on him, which meant that his level of activity within the town need not be that restricted.</p> <p>The gloomy thief Fenlist did not hesitate. He raised his cup and gulped down its contents. Gullit thought for a moment. “Sir, you do not seem familiar. Is this your first time in Wissen Town? How should I address you?”</p> <p>Seeing the thief finish his alcohol in a gulp, Yang Long shook his head as he recalled the forthright dwarf Rumi. “I am Yang Ling, a merchant selling weapons. I heard that Wissen Town has a huge demand for weapons and thus came here to see if that was true!”</p> <p>Yang Ling picked a reasonable identity without much consideration. When he had strolled through the town, Yang Ling had noticed that there was not a respectable weapons shop in the entire Wissen Town. The town would require a large number of weapons, be it for gathering wood or hunting in Terras Forest. Perhaps setting up a weapons shop in the town would be a fine investment.</p> <p>After taking a sip of the wheat beer Yang Ling bought, Gullit said, “Oh, so its merchant Yang, pardon my rudeness. Oh right, I wonder what merchant’s association you belong to?”</p> <p>After hearing that Yang Ling was prepared to set up a weapons shot, Gullit had many thoughts. A weapons shop was different from a metalsmith. The former would need to invest a large amount of money and resources. No one would dare open a weapons shop without sufficient capital.</p> <p>“Oh, it is a small merchant’s association. You wouldn’t know it even if I said its name!” Yang Ling smiled mysteriously. “I have already come to an agreement with the dwarves regarding the weapons and armor, and capital is of no problem either. All I lack now are a few workers. I wonder if you two would be willing to help me?”</p> <p>The weapons made by the dwarves were famous in the continent for their sharpness and strength. Yang Ling believed that business would be booming if he got the dwarf Rumi to work for him. Of course, the venture would become even more successful if he got a few locals to help him. It was the same logic as how corporations liked to hire locals as their PR consultants.</p> <p>“What, the dwarves?”</p> <p>Gullit and Fenlist looked at each other in shock. The dwarves had impeccable skills, and the weapons they forged were always in high demand. If what Yang Ling said was true, then he must truly be someone rich. The small merchant’s association he spoke of would have to be incredible, but he must just be unwilling to reveal it to them.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Gullit and Fenlist reached a silent agreement. If everything was true, then they would have a golden opportunity in their hands if they were willing to work with Yang Ling. Even if Yang Ling was lying, it was a gamble worth taking.</p> <p>After reaching an agreement, Gullit and Fenlist led Yang Ling to a better seat in the bar before engaging in passionate conversation. Quickly, Yang Ling learned the general situation surrounding Wissen Town. From the thief Fenlist, who hated the Anca family to the core, he even learned that the second aunt of the master of the Anca family loved to wear pink panties with frills.</p>",
  "Chapter 18: Maid Alice": "<p>“What, the assassination was unsuccessful?” In an opulent castle, Ymir was furious. “She claims to be able to kill in ten steps, yet she was unable to deal with a mere Summoner! What a pile of dogsh*t!”</p> <p>Ymir threw the teacup in his hand onto the ground. “Goode, I want to personally murder that detestable Summoner. I want to feed his flesh to the dogs!”</p> <p>“Young master, now is not the time to strike!” Goode pulled gently on his beard. “The masters won’t return from sea for a month. Recently, several people we don’t know have also come to the town. It is not appropriate for us to strike now!”</p> <p>Ymir was in a pinch lately. He had been faced with problems ever since he suffered defeat in the battle against the elves. Someone had spread the rumor that there was a giant dragon’s cave in Terras Forest, and that had attracted many unidentified people into the town. Some were money hungry explorers, some were troops from all over the land, some were knights whose dream was to slay a dragon. In fact, it was said that the Church had secretly sent an envoy to this town.</p> <p>With the influx of strangers, the power situation in the town had become more complicated. Lately, several members of the family had been killed or gone missing. Some said that it was the family’s enemies seeking revenge, others claimed that they had offended a powerful mystery person when they were patrolling outside. This complicated situation had given Ymir many headaches.</p> <p>Ymir did not care much about ordinary explorers or troops, but the envoy sent by the Church was no small matter. It would be a troublesome situation if the envoy was to obtain evidence of their criminal activities. Unfortunately, his father had been forced to take a large number of elite warriors with him to attend to an important matter. There were not many experts left in the family.</p> <p>“Goode, what you mean is…” Only Goode, a tactician who had followed his father for many years, could calm Ymir down.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Goode slowly said, “The situation in the town is very complicated, so we should not act rashly until the master comes back. In the past two days, I have contacted a great swordsman from the Banto Empire. Perhaps we could…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>After a secret discussion, Ymir and the tactician had come up with a plan. The family’s main source of income was the trafficking of slaves, and amongst those slaves, beautiful elf ladies were always on high demand. In order to clear the obstacles hindering them from capturing the elves in the forest, and also to exact revenge for the arrow to his butt, Ymir had to remove the mysterious Summoner that was Yang Ling.</p> <p>In a bar not far away from the Anca family castle, Yang Ling smiled as he took a sip of beer, completely oblivious to the tornado he was going to be engulfed by.</p> <p>“I will go see to the preparations immediately, and I would like both of you to monitor the situation here for the next few days!”</p> <p>Nonchalantly tossing a few Purple Crystal Coins onto the table, Yang Ling left quickly. Behind him, the thief Fenlist exclaimed in shock, grabbing the Purple Crystal Coins on the table immediately. A few cups of beer only cost a little more than ten Black Crystal Coins, but Yang Ling had tossed five Purple Crystal Coins onto the table. He sure was a rich nobleman.</p> <p>Noticing Fenlist’s reaction, Yang Ling smiled. To deal with these people, Yang Ling knew that he had to display a certain amount of wealth. Money was a great motivating factor for these guys. He understood that getting locals such as Gullit and Fenlist to work under him was the fastest way for him to gain a foothold in Wissen Town.</p> <p>Attacking was the best defense. In order to deal with the Anca family’s attack, Yang Ling had decided to take the risk and open a unique shop selling weapons made by dwarves right in Wissen Town. He could not only obtain information, but also attract the attention of the Anca family, taking a more active role in the conflict. Of course, it would be even better if he could earn money.</p> <p>The influx of foreigners into Wissen Town was a headache for Ymir, but a golden opportunity for Yang Ling. The more complicated the situation was, the more cautious the powerful Anca family had to be, and the more advantageous it became for Yang Ling.</p> <p>After quickly returning to the elf tribe, Yang Ling tried his best to convince the elf elder. The elder was worried, but he would support Yang Ling all he could. He promised to send a few brave warriors to protect Yang Ling. At the same time, because Yang Ling asked, he took out the last of his eighty barrels of rum and handed them over.</p> <p>Taking a full eighty barrels of rum, Yang Ling headed over to the dwarf tribe with confidence. As expected, the dwarf Rumi immediately accepted the offer after receiving the full eighty barrels of rum.</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, as long as I can have good wine every day, I’ll follow you to Dead Soul City or the Delan Desert, much less Wissen City!” Rumi grabbed the wine flask by his waist as he walked, taking a huge gulp.</p> <p>“The world outside is very interesting, and there’s an abundance of good wine!” Seeing Casey and the rest filling their bags with weapons, Yang Ling made an empty promise. “Rumi, as long as you and your men can forge weapons for me, I’ll make sure that you can sleep in a bathtub full of wine if you wish!”</p> <p>According to the customs of the dwarves, Rumi had to gain experience in the outside world this year, since he had come of age. Under the influence of alcohol, he had decided to agree to Yang Ling’s request, even inviting a full five members of his tribe to help him.</p> <p>At the same time, with Rumi as his mediator, Yang Ling was able to buy a large number of weapons for a cheap price from the dwarf tribe. Luckily, Yang Ling had saved many people from the hands of the barbarians; otherwise, he did not know how he was going to move the weapons out of the Terras Forest.</p> <p>Even though the elf elder did not say anything, Yang Ling understood that it was unsuitable for this many humans to live with the elves for such a long period of time. After discussing it with Casey and the rest, they decided it was best to head to Wissen Town together; after all, many of them had been born there and had lived there all their lives.</p> <p>Ever since she was saved, Alice and the rest had hoped to return quickly to Wissen Town. But the journey was long, and there were many Magical Beasts prowling the forest, so they had no choice but to rest in the elf tribe for the time being. But now with Yang Ling personally leading the team, their worries had been largely quelled.</p> <p>“Sir, after we reach Wissen Town, if you do not mind, you can first live in my house. How about that?” Casey caught up to Yang Ling and extended a warm invitation.</p> <p>“Casey, since there are so many here without a place to return to, how many can your house fit?” Yang Ling laughed. “Don’t worry, I have made appropriate arrangements!”</p> <p>After convincing the elf elder, Yang Ling had returned to Wissen Town on his gryphon and purchased a large house with Gullit and Fenlist’s help. The front of the house would be used to sell weapons, while the back would be used to forge weapons as well as house the homeless. Two birds with one stone.</p> <p>With Yang Ling and the Magical Beast army’s protection, the group managed to escape the vast Terras Forest ten days later without much harm. With Gullit leading the way, they headed directly to the place they had purchased not long ago.</p> <p>Following that, the group got busy. Rumi had brought with him the forge used by members of his tribe and was preparing to forge weapons in town, and Casey led some warriors Yang Ling had saved to patrol the surroundings, in case of a sudden attack from the Anca family. Gullit and Fenlist were responsible for promoting the dwarf’s weapon shop to people in the town.</p> <p>“Refreshing, not bad, better than the high class Biluochun served in Anxi!” Yang Ling took a sip of the tea Alice had brought him as he leaned back on his tiger skin chair. He surveyed the busy group and the fast progress.</p> <p>“Sir, this is a jasmine tea made using a Lone Petal Vine. It has a refreshing scent, and it is the specialty of Wissen Town!” Alice gently massaged Yang Ling’s shoulders after he put the teacup down.</p> <p>Ever since Yang Ling had saved her grandfather, Alice had been full of gratitude toward him and had taken great care of him. She hoped to repay the favor this way. When Yang Ling was busy and covered in sweat, she would hand him a handkerchief. When Yang Ling did not have time to eat, she would keep the food warm. When Yang Ling was tired, she would gently massage his shoulders.</p> <p>At the start, Yang Ling felt a little bad, but seeing how persistent Alice was, he began to accept the lady’s goodwill.</p> <p>“Alice, you need not call me Sir in the future, and please do not address me as Master or what not.” Seeing Alice’s pretty face and her perky breasts, Yang Ling had a thought. “You can call me Big Brother Yang in the future!”</p> <p>“Alright, Big Brother Yang!” Alice was blushing as she replied. For some reason, she felt that the gaze Yang Ling was giving her was different from what she had seen in the past. There seemed to be a blazing ball of flame in his eyes.</p> <p>The feeling of being a boss is pretty good!</p> <p>Leaning comfortably into the chair, seeing the weapons made by dwarves in the shop, smelling the faint fragrance coming from Alice’s body, Yang Ling slowly closed his eyes. He’d had an office job in the other world, nearly starving even though he worked hard. He did not expect to earn his first basket of gold so soon after arriving in this strange, foreign world.</p> <p>Yang Ling closed his eyes, fully enjoying Alice’s service, completely oblivious to the troubles to come. A few hundred miles away, in an uninhabited plain, a horse was galloping fast toward Wissen Town.</p>",
  "Chapter 19: Wager": "<p>After toiling for a few days, the first weapons shop in Wissen Town successfully opened its doors.</p> <p>With Fenlist and Gullit’s advertising, the people of the town swarmed the shop on the day of the opening. There was a sea of people outside the shop.</p> <p>“My god, weapons made by dwarves. These are all weapons made by dwarves!”</p> <p>“Oh, am I seeing things, a beautiful elf server? Oh Yiblis, I dare say that the boss of this weapons shop must be someone of high status!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the opulently decorated weapons shop, Sofia lined up with her sisters. Their beautiful faces, perky breasts, slender thighs, and sweet smiles dumbfounded the guests around them.</p> <p>The popular dwarf-made weapons and the captivating elf beauties. Shocking, too shocking.</p> <p>Even though Wissen Town was near the Terras Forest, dwarves and elves rarely appeared in the town. Seeing the variety of exquisite weapons and the beautiful elves, the crowd engaged in whispers, all discussing Yang Ling’s identity and background.</p> <p>“Hey, I heard that the boss of this shop is a very rich man, with businesses all over the continent.”</p> <p>“Tsk, how can he just be a rich man? No average rich man could set up this kind of shop.” A young man sneakily observed the surroundings, then whispered, “It is rumored that this young man has frequently been seen near the palace of the Banto Empire…”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, could he be royalty?” The people around the young man were shocked.</p> <p>“Hehe, your words, not mine!” the young man whispered. “Don’t try anything funny here, we can’t afford to offend the boss. We won’t have enough lives to enjoy the money we got!”</p> <p>Hearing the guesses of the crowd, Yang Ling, who was leaning on his tiger skin chair, shook his head and took a sip of the jasmine tea Alice brought him. He thought about whether he should get a few fierce barbarians to stand guard in front of the store. That might attract even more attention.</p> <p>The most important thing when running a business was attracting the attention of potential customers. Yang Ling was very satisfied by the turnout today. After all, as long as there was a flow of traffic, his business would definitely be bustling. Looking at the number of troops purchasing weapons and armor, he realized that he had come across a golden opportunity.</p> <p>With his rich mineral resources and expert dwarf blacksmiths, Yang Ling was confident that he would be able to monopolize the weapons trade in Wissen Town. Even though there were not many people living in the town itself, troops and adventurers often passed through this place. As long as he managed the shop carefully, he would definitely turn a monstrous profit.</p> <p>Perhaps he could even invent chainmail; that would make his business boom!</p> <p>Yang Ling took a sip of the jasmine tea and thought about the famous chainmail. After these days of observation, Yang Ling had noticed that the troops were either wearing weak leather armor or overly-large plated armor. If he could design a light yet sturdy chainmail, it would definitely appeal to the customers.</p> <p>“You have the cheek to sell these broken toys to the public? Where’s the boss? Get him out here!” Just as Yang Ling was thinking about his idea, a loud roar came from outside the door.</p> <p>“Who are you, do you think you can meet our boss just because you want to?” Without waiting for Yang Ling’s instructions, Fenlist spread his arms to block the unfriendly warrior in black.</p> <p>Ever since Yang Ling brought over a large amount of dwarf-made weapons and a few elf beauties, Gullit and Fenlist had understood that they had made the right gamble. Yang Ling was definitely born into a rich family. As long as they got into his good books, a life of fame and money awaited them. Thus, they were particularly diligent when it came to their work.</p> <p>“I am the Banto Empire’s Great Swordsman from the royal family, Batiste Mayer. Hmph, get your boss to come out immediately!” The warrior in black gave a cold grunt, planting his foot into Fenlist’s chest. A crack could be heard as Fenlist’s ribs broke. The pain caused the thief to fall to the ground.</p> <p>Seeing how unfriendly their visitor was, Casey quickly drew his sharp longsword and instructed the other warriors to surround Batiste. As a beginner swordsman, he understood how terrifying a Great Swordsman would be. Even he might be defeated within a few moves against this man in black, much less a weaker swordsman like Argus.</p> <p>“Hmph, you’re asking for death!”</p> <p>Batiste let out a cold grunt and drew the longsword on his waist. A red light flashed as deep cuts formed on the chests of everyone other than Casey.</p> <p>“Oh god, Red Blood Battle Energy!” Seeing the pulsing red glow on Batiste’s sword, a few more experienced troops were shocked. They quickly stepped back, retreating multiple steps away from Batiste before they could calm themselves down.</p> <p>Witnessing this scene, Casey understood that he was no match for his opponent. His opponent could use the Red Blood Battle Energy, and with abilities that powerful, how could he just be an ordinary Great Swordsman? He might already be nearing the level of Sword Saint.</p> <p>“Exciting, bravo!” With a cold smile, Yang Ling slowly walked out. “May I ask your motive for coming here today?”</p> <p>“Hmph, spare me the nonsense. If your weapons can cause a scratch on my shield over here, I’ll admit defeat; otherwise, don’t try fooling the people here with such rubbish!” Batiste spoke as he lifted his heavy shield. The shield emitted a red glow after he circulated the Battle Energy in his body.</p> <p>“What do you want to wager?” Yang Ling was unmoved, secretly analyzing Batiste’s background and motive.</p> <p>After a cold grunt, Batiste calmly said, “If you win, you can take my head; if you lose, hehe, cut your own neck!”</p> <p>A duel of life and death?</p> <p>Batiste had just said this when the people around them erupted into commotion. Popular dwarf-made weapons, captivating elf beauties, a mysterious boss, and now a Great Swordsman; could this be an early April Fool’s joke?</p> <p>Seeing the confident Batiste, Yang Ling had a thought. This Great Swordsman had come to cause trouble exactly on the day he opened for business, and the man had asked for Yang Ling’s head the moment he spoke. It was clear that he had come prepared, possibly under Ymir’s instructions.</p> <p>Well, this was bound to happen eventually. Yang Ling understood that only Ymir had animosity towards him, and only the powerful Anca family could quickly invite a royal Great Swordsman from the Banto Empire into town this quickly.</p> <p>“Sir, the Red Blood Battle Energy in this Great Swordsman’s body is incredibly thick. If you cannot break his protective aura, there’s no way that you can scratch the shield in his hands!” Casey swallowed and said fiercely, “This man was definitely instigated by someone, intentionally causing trouble on the day of our opening!”</p> <p>There was no such thing as an unstoppable spear, nor was there an unbreakable shield!</p> <p>Seeing the nonchalant Batiste, then the heavy red shield in his hands, Yang Ling came up with a great idea. Since the other party was being unreasonable and reinforcing his shield with his Battle Energy, then he did not mind using tricks of his own and giving his opponent a surprise.</p>",
  "Chapter 20: The Remorseful Great Swordsman": "<p>Yang Ling took out a dull dagger from his Space Ring and walked slowly toward Batiste.</p> <p>The fangs of the Horned Bee Beast were incredibly sharp, able to bite through even heavy swords made by the dwarves, much less an ordinary sword. But this dagger he had picked up in Valenia Valley was particularly surprising. Even though it didn’t look exceptional, it was immensely sharp. Also, even the most powerful Horned Bee Beast he had could not leave a scratch on the dagger.</p> <p>“Sir Batiste, do you want to reconsider? After all, this is a matter of life and death.” Yang Ling let out a cold smile, summoning an evolved Horned Bee Beast and hiding it within his sleeve without anyone noticing.</p> <p>“What a joke. I, Batiste, have killed countless people. Do you think I fear a child like you?”</p> <p>Batiste was very proud. Ever since he graduated from the lessons of the Sword Saint Barzark, he had never lost in a formal duel. He then went on to undertake the role of Great Swordsman of the royal family in the Banto Empire and enjoyed a life of luxury.</p> <p>He might be able to recoup his losses back in the Capital after he cut off the head of this chap. Batiste was excited. He had just lost all his money in the Red Flower Casino when business came looking for him: a full 50,000 Purple Crystal Coins for killing Yang Ling.</p> <p>A Summoner who could not use Battle Energy trying to leave a scratch on his shield infused with his Battle Energy was wishful thinking. Batiste looked casually at Yang Ling who was walking toward him. He was full of praise for Ymir’s plan.</p> <p>Today was the grand opening of Yang Ling’s weapon shop. If Yang Ling were to step down from the challenge, that would be akin to admitting that the weapons in his shop were trash. He would not be able to continue his business in Wissen Town anymore; if he was so brazen as to accept the challenge, Ymir could kill Yang Ling through Batiste.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, don’t go, don’t!” Seeing the battle ready Batiste, then looking at Yang Ling walking toward him, Sofia charged forward. “Yang Ling, you need not care about this madman; we can return to Terras Forest!”</p> <p>Sofia let her emotions show as she saw Yang Ling forced to accept the challenge, her eyes teary with worry. She hoped that Yang Ling would be able to abandon all of this. She hoped that Yang Ling would return to Terras Forest and live a peaceful life with her.</p> <p>After a moment’s hesitation, Alice also charged forward, her eyes red. “Brother Yang, Sister Sofia is not wrong. He is a madman, don’t stoop to his level!”</p> <p>After understanding Batiste’s abilities, Casey and the rest also charged forward, glaring straight at Batiste. If looks could kill, then Batiste would have been killed by them ten thousand times over.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, this is too much. A Great Swordsman using these despicable tricks, isn’t this murder?”</p> <p>“That’s right, this is too much!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing the red aura radiating from the shield in Batiste’s hands, the more experienced troops understood that Yang Ling, who did not have Battle Energy, did not have any chance of winning. They understood that the overbearing Batiste was out for Yang Ling’s life, and they slipped into discussion.</p> <p>“Hmph, those who feel I am being unjust can step forward. I, Batiste, will send them on their way!” After hearing the discussions of the crowd, the Great Swordsman Batiste spat, his shifty eyes scanning the surroundings. The crowd shut their mouths. After all, the abilities of a Great Swordsman were nothing to scoff at. Even experienced troops were not willing to invite trouble. They could only feel angry, but they could not speak out against it.</p> <p>“Michelle, I am sure that this is murder. If this Great Swordsman has no animosity against the young man, then he must have been employed by the enemies of the young man!”</p> <p>Outside the crowd, a man and a woman were seated on two tall white horses. The man had a piercing gaze and was wearing heavy black armor. There was a heavy sword hanging by his waist and a long spear in his arms. He was clearly an elite knight. The lady’s face was half veiled, her hands wielding a black staff; she was clearly a mysterious spellcaster.</p> <p>“Clause, as a Divine Knight, are you just going to sit and watch?” The veiled spellcaster creased her brows as she looked at the arrogant Batiste. She said nonchalantly, “The warrior’s association in the Banto Empire is becoming more and more lawless. For a Great Swordsman to use such a tactic against a young man without any Battle Energy!”</p> <p>Seeing the crowd gathered around them, the heavily armored knight coldly said, “This Great Swordsman is indeed going too far, but Michelle, we are here on a secret mission. It would not be good if we exposed our identities!”</p> <p>Hearing Clause say this, then looking at Yang Ling who did not have Battle Energy, the spellcaster Michelle sighed. She did not say any more, but silently clutched the staff in her hands.</p> <p>“Brave warriors, thank you for your patronage today!” Yang Ling lightly pushed away the worried Sofia and Alice, then took large steps toward Batiste. “I have a normal dagger made by dwarves in my hands. Now let us see whether the shield in this Great Swordsman’s hands is harder than my dagger is sharp!”</p> <p>After lifting the dagger in his hand for the crowd to see, Yang Ling walked toward Batiste without emotion, as if he had no idea how powerful the Great Swordsman was.</p> <p>At the same time, seeing Yang Ling walk toward him, Batiste let out a cold smile. He instinctively poured all of his Battle Energy into the shield in his right hand. In that moment, the shield released a shining red light. It looked like a ball of burning flames from far away.</p> <p>“Oh god, poor child!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, I have seen a fool, but I have never seen a lad as foolish as this one. He is heading straight for his death!”</p> <p>“Hehe, I dare say that this young boss is a man who has never seen the world; he has no idea how powerful a Great Swordsman is!” a young man gloated. “This is a good show, and his family will definitely look for this Great Swordsman after the boss dies, hehe!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing the overbearing Batiste and Yang Ling, who was clearly in trouble, the crowd slipped into discussion. Some of them were sympathetic, some scolding Yang Ling for being a fool and not knowing when to retreat. There were also some who gloated over Yang Ling’s plight.</p> <p>In the midst of their discussion, Yang Ling circulated the wizard powers in his body and suddenly accelerated, pouncing toward the arrogant Batiste, fast as lightning. The opening of his right sleeve was aimed directly at Batiste’s chest.</p> <p>Just as the crowd was certain that Yang Ling would die, an accident happened!</p> <p>The unfeeling Batiste shuddered, the flame-like red aura of his shield scattering like the tide. Then Yang Ling’s dagger struck forward, piercing through the sturdy shield.</p> <p>How could a royal Great Swordsman of the Banto Empire lose to a young man without any Battle Energy?</p> <p>Dumbfounded by such a sudden upset, the crowd struggled to come to their senses. They were quiet until Yang Ling placed the dagger beside Batiste’s neck. Then they broke into an uproar.</p> <p>“Kill him!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, chop off his head!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The crowd was shouting with all their might. The troops with wounds on their chests roared as they flailed the weapons in their hands. It looked like the arrogant Great Swordsman had long invited public fury.</p> <p>“You…”</p> <p>After being struck by three poisonous stingers of the Horned Bee Beast due to his carelessness, Batiste had turned numb. In shock, he started to call Yang Ling despicable when he felt a pain in his neck. A streak of blood flowed downward.</p> <p>“It looks like the throat of a Great Swordsman is the same as all of ours, he can bleed too!” Seeing the fearful Batiste, Yang Ling coldly said, “Should I slice open his throat with this dagger, or cleave off his entire head with an axe? Or maybe I chop you up into five pieces?”</p> <p>Seeing the cold light in Yang Ling’s eyes, then looking at the cold smile on his face, Batiste trembled. He did not dare say a word, nor did he dare move. As an experienced swordsman, he understood that the dagger on his throat was not a piece of useless steel. All Yang Ling had to do was move his arm, and Batiste could say goodbye to this world.</p> <p>Batiste was immensely remorseful. He was cursing Ymir and his ancestors in his heart. If not for his carelessness, boastfully using all of his protective Battle Energy on his shield, how would a royal Great Swordsman like him fall to a sneak attack by Yang Ling! If Ymir had provided him with accurate information, how would he have let down his guard and been reduced to such a pitiful state!</p>",
  "Chapter 21: Toad": "<p>Looking at the rowdy crowd, then looking at the pale Batiste, Yang Ling understood that this unlucky Great Swordsman was merely a chess piece, a lackey. The people who truly wanted his life was the Anca family, a despicable family whose primary source of income was slave trade.</p> <p>“Batiste, there is no animosity between us. I’ll spare your life if you tell me who the mastermind behind all of this is!” Yang Ling had an idea after thinking for a moment. He wanted to strike back at the Anca family.</p> <p>After falling into Yang Ling’s hands, the powerless Batiste had thought that he would definitely lose his life here. He had a glint of hope in his eyes after hearing Yang Ling’s words. He opened his mouth, intending to tell Yang Ling the whole truth, but he started to hesitate after he thought about how powerful the Anca family was.</p> <p>“Batiste, living is the ultimate luxury. You have unmeasurable money and power, good wine and beautiful ladies. Are you willing to leave just like that?” Yang Ling let out a smile as he continued tempting the hesitating Batiste. “You have to live every day as if it were your last, and you won’t get another opportunity like this in the future. Don’t regret not taking up my offer only after you arrive in Hell!”</p> <p>Batiste’s thoughts were running wild. He had killed many in his life, and he had used his powerful abilities to win the status and riches he had dreamt off. He had not expected to carelessly fall prey to Yang Ling, a person who had no Battle Energy at all.</p> <p>He knew that he was not an upright person, as one needed a certain level of scheming to survive in this world. But he had already lost his reputation now that he had lost to Yang Ling. If he was going to announce Ymir, the mastermind behind the operation to the world, it was most likely that he would no longer have a place in the Banto Empire even if he did not die today. At this moment, he was deliberating between keeping his life and his future chances.</p> <p>“Batiste, since you want to die so badly, I will send you on your way!” Yang Ling observed Batiste and noticed that he was still hesitating, thus he applied a little pressure on his right hand. At that moment, Batiste felt a sharp pain on his neck. His blood was flowing out like spring water.</p> <p>“I’ll tell, spare me, I’ll tell!” Seeing the cold Yang Ling, smelling the metallic stench of his blood, the hesitant Batiste finally broke down.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s mixture of temptation and threats, Batiste had no choice but to expose the Anca family’s scheme in front of everyone. “I have no animosity against Sir Yang Ling, but I was employed to cause trouble here. All of this was under the instructions of Young Master Ymir of the Anca family…”</p> <p>After hearing the ins and outs of the incident, the spectators understood why a Great Swordsman like Batiste would cause trouble on this day. Slowly, the crowd became more and more agitated, their anger pointing toward the evil Anca family. Some said they wanted to dismember Batiste, some vented their anger on the despicable Ymir. There were even others who loudly cursed the ancestors of the Anca family.</p> <p>After successfully igniting the fury the crowd had for the Anca family, Yang Ling decided to go on further, pushing the powerless Batiste to the front of the crowd before loudly saying, “Brave warriors, should we kill this arrogant bully of a man?”</p> <p>“Yes, dismember him!”</p> <p>“Burn him to death!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, mince his meat and feed him to the dogs!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>In their fury, the crowd glared at Batiste, who had been serving Ymir. They wanted so badly to kill him themselves. The limp Batiste was frightened, his body trembling.</p> <p>“I have heard rumors that the Anca family had done much evil, causing public dissent. It looks like this is indeed the case!” Michelle, who was riding on her tall white horse, creased her slender brows.</p> <p>“Hmph, that is the outcome of evildoers!” The knight let out a cold grunt. He saw a dried leaf caught in Michelle’s hair and extended his hand to brush it off. But the female spellcaster did not appreciate the gesture, instead turning her body to avoid him.</p> <p>Seeing Michelle intentionally widening the distance between them, the black armored knight said unhappily, “Michelle, do you not understand my feelings for you even after all these years? For you, I have stayed in the Divine Palace for a whole three years!”</p> <p>“Clause, a Knight of the Divine Palace has to have solid faith; if you are staying for your own personal feelings, I would advise you to leave while you still can!” The female spellcaster hesitated for a moment before continuing, “I am sorry. As a sacred spellcaster of the Church, there is only the God of Light and the devotees in my heart.”</p> <p>After being rejected once again, Clause was overcome with dejection. After becoming a Knight of the Divine Palace, he did indeed have more opportunities to interact with the beautiful Michelle, but he was unable to move her despite all his years of trying.</p> <p>“I am a merchant whose only wish is to engage in business peacefully. Also, we should be killing the despicable Ymir instead of Batiste!” Yang Ling once again pointed the vengeance of the crowd toward Ymir. He said loudly, “Even though I am not a fan of fighting, that does not mean that I am willing to be bullied like this. This person over here has escaped death, but that does not mean that he does not need to be punished!”</p> <p>Seeing a nearby metalsmith shouting with a rod in hand, Yang Ling had an idea. He grabbed the soot-covered rod from the man. While the crowd was confused, Yang Ling pulled Batiste’s pants down and wrote the word Anca on his buttocks.</p> <p>“Hehe, Batiste, I’ll spare your wretched life if you jump out of Wissen Town naked like a toad. Otherwise…” Yang Ling said as he moved the sharp dagger around Batiste’s private parts, causing him to tremble in fear.</p> <p>After seeing clearly the word on Batiste’s buttocks, the people around them first froze in fear, then instantly broke into an uproar. To think that Yang Ling would be this merciless, instantly thinking of a plan to humiliate the Anca family.</p> <p>At the same time, even though he did not know what Yang Ling wrote on his buttocks, Batiste felt that it was not appropriate after seeing Yang Ling’s faint smile and the joyful looks of the crowd. But he was powerless. All he could do was plead, “Sir, please spare me. Return my pants to me, I’ll pay you a thousand, no, twenty thousand Purple Crystal Coins!”</p> <p>Seeing the crowd staring at his buttocks, Batiste was incredibly humiliated. He pulled on his pink underwear. He wanted to ram into a wall or dig a hole into the ground. But his underwear was too small, unable to cover the words on his butt, nor the gazes of the crowd around him.</p> <p>“I’ll count to three; if you are not going to jump out like a toad, then you can go on a naked run in Hell!” Yang Ling raised his dagger and moved it against Batiste’s body. The cold steel frightened the pathetic Great Swordsman into a tremble.</p> <p>In order to preserve his life, Batiste had no choice but to jump out like a toad. After being taunted by Yang Ling to croak while he jumped, he had to fight the urge to commit suicide and follow orders.</p> <p>“Anca, toad!”</p> <p>“Toad, Anca!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Like a shouting group of children, a group of troops started chanting rowdily, spreading the chants all over the town.</p> <p>One more step further?</p> <p>Seeing the jumping Batiste, Yang Ling rolled his eyes and decided to spice things up even further. He summoned a Horned Bee Beast and ordered it to pounce toward Batiste and tear his underwear to shreds. In that moment, Batiste’s private parts were displayed to the world, once again inviting the laughter of the crowd. As for the pitiful Great Swordsman, all he could do was shamefully cover his privates as he jumped.</p> <p>Shame, embarrassment, humiliation…</p> <p>Batiste wanted to kill himself. If this incident were to spread, he would become the laughing stock of the world even if he did not lose his job. He would no longer have the prestigious title of a royal Great Swordsman. If he had known that this would happen, he would not have accepted this job for five hundred thousand, much less fifty thousand.</p> <p>“Gangster, pervert!”</p> <p>No one knew where the Horned Bee Beast came from, but Michelle could see clearly from atop her white horse. She knew that it was Yang Ling’s idea. She was angry, not expecting him to be such a mischievous person. At the same time, as she looked at the naked Batiste running away with his butt shaking, she could not help but break into laughter. The Knight of the Divine Palace was dumbfounded when he looked at her blushing fair skin.</p> <p>As the crowd was roaring with laughter, Ymir, who had been observing the situation while hiding on a slope, nearly vomited blood.</p> <p>“Ah… Yang Ling, you detestable Summoner! I want to skin you alive and drink your blood!”</p> <p>Ymir, whose plans had been foiled, scratched insanely on the giant stone beneath him, leaving behind countless dents and traces of blood. If he was in front of Yang Ling right now, he would have pounced toward him and bitten him to death.</p>",
  "Chapter 22: Just Who’s the Pervert?": "<p>After they were done shouting for vengeance, the group crowded toward Yang Ling and engaged in passionate conversation. In all these years, Yang Ling was the only one who had dared to humiliate the Anca family like that. This, coupled with the lavish decorations and alarming workers he had under him, convinced the crowd that Yang Ling was indeed a noble, a noble with powerful backing. He must not have much consideration for the Anca family.</p> <p>After the crowd scattered, more than a dozen mysterious people paid a visit to Yang Ling. Amongst them were the boss of a wood-processing company, the owner of the smithy, the owner of the bar… Basically every influential person and merchant with decent clout other than the Anca family in Wissen Town were all there.</p> <p>“Sir, welcome to Wissen Town. May I ask, how long are you going to stay here?” After the formalities, the boss of the bar, Andrew, asked nonchalantly. In the eyes of the crowd, opening a shop selling weapons made by dwarves here in the town might just be a whim to a powerful noble like Yang Ling.</p> <p>There’s more than meets the eye!</p> <p>Observing the situation, Yang Ling quickly understood why the group had visited him. The Anca family had committed many atrocities and harmed the civilians. Even the more influential people in the town could not take this any longer, much less an average civilian.</p> <p>“I am the same as all of you, just an ordinary merchant. I’ll probably go wherever is profitable for my business.” Yang Ling let out a mysterious smile.</p> <p>Ordinary merchant?</p> <p>The group looked at each other, understanding that this was merely Yang Ling’s excuse. If he was just an ordinary merchant, how could he have the money to set up a weapon shop run by dwarves, or employ guards and elves as servers?</p> <p>After finishing the rum in his glass, the dark-skinned steelsmith said loudly, “Sir Yang, you have publicly humiliated the Anca family today. They will definitely think of ways to exact revenge, so you have to be on guard!”</p> <p>“Yes, the Anca family is very powerful. You have to be careful. I wonder Sir, how many guards do you have by your side?” The owner of the bar Andrew looked nervously at Yang Ling, seemingly more nervous for him than Yang Ling was for himself.</p> <p>The reason the group had paid a visit to Yang Ling was to see how powerful Yang Ling really was. If his abilities ran deep and were enough to hold his own against the Anca family, he would definitely be a blessing to the people of Wissen Town. If his abilities were not powerful enough, or if he had come to Wissen Town on a whim, with no intentions of dealing with the Anca family, then the people of Wissen Town would be doomed.</p> <p>“Hehe, the Anca family? They are merely a bunch of clowns!” Yang Ling took a sip of the sweet rum before continuing, “I have come here this time with the hopes of creating an empire with my abilities. I do not wish to rely on the powers of my family!”</p> <p>Just as he had with the elf elder, Yang Ling allowed the group’s misunderstanding of his identity to continue. After all, no one would believe him even if he were to tell them how he had arrived in this world. Allowing the misunderstanding to continue might even have surprising benefits.</p> <p>He does not wish to rely on the powers of his family? Yet another rich kid who has never seen the world. The group was a little dejected. The Anca family was a powerful organization, so how would Yang Ling hope to deal with the Anca family without the help of his family?</p> <p>Looking at the dejected Andrew, Yang Ling understood what they were thinking. He feigned worry, “I have quite a few friends. I can deal with the Anca family without having to rely on my family, but unfortunately…”</p> <p>“Unfortunately what?” The dark-skinned steelsmith sensed a ray of hope as he directed a steely gaze at the hesitant Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Even though they are my friends, I am too embarrassed to get them to help me without giving them a little reward! But I just opened this shop and do not have much money left. Furthermore, this house is too small. There’s no way to accommodate too many warriors, even if I called them here!” Yang Ling feigned dejection as he sighed.</p> <p>“No problem! You can count on us; the more warriors you can invite the better!” The owner of the bar Andrew was elated as he patted his chest, promising to solve all of Yang Ling’s problems. Even though business in his bar was bustling, most of his earnings had to be given to the bloodsucking Anca family. If Yang Ling was able to get rid of the Anca family, he would give up a few years of his profit, much less a mere house.</p> <p>After coming to an agreement, Andrew and the rest of the group acted fast, quickly delivering presents to Yang Ling by the dozen. Other than tens of thousands of Purple Crystal Coins, they also gave him a chest of Magical Beast Essence Crystals and countless specialty items. Furthermore, they also got the townspeople around the weapons shop to move elsewhere, building a giant house for Yang Ling in the area.</p> <p>After all these favors, as well as to prevent Ymir from launching a full-powered attack on him, Yang Ling revisited the Barbarian tribe to prepare an elite Barbarian group. Barbarians were naturally powerful and fearless, making them the best candidates to take the frontline.</p> <p>The leader of the Barbarians got worried once Yang Ling said that the market for Magical Beast Essence Crystals and Dark Fire Crystals was not good lately. But this Ancient Summoner was powerful, and his background was even more alarming. He did not dare fight against him, nor could he get him to leave; after receiving the salt and foodstuffs brought over by Yang Ling, he had no choice but to quickly agree to his requests and send out a hundred of his most elite warriors.</p> <p>Yang Ling had just returned to Wissen Town for a few days when Sofia brought fifty elite elf archers to him. Rumi also brought over a full eighty brave dwarf warriors. Along with the hundred swordsmen they had gathered in Wissen Town, they quickly set up a powerful group of guards, allowing the bullied townspeople of Wissen Town to see a ray of hope.</p> <p>Perhaps having received some news, the lackeys of the Anca family were being more cautious, mostly hiding within the heavily guarded castle. But Yang Ling did not let his guard down as he understood that a powerful thunderstorm might be brewing under these peaceful times. He ordered the dwarf Rumi to quickly create armor and weapons for the guards.</p> <p>After handing the reins of the guards to Casey, Yang Ling became the person with the most time on his hands. He either spent his time training his own Magical Beast army or cultivating the mysterious Wizard Mantra. Other than that, he would spend most of his time enjoying the services of Alice.</p> <p>“Is it here?” Alice was blushing.</p> <p>“Yes, harder please!”</p> <p>“Do you want it faster?”</p> <p>“Mmhmm…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>With half his body submerged in his bathtub, Yang Ling closed his eyes as he enjoyed the massage Alice was giving him. He was so comfortable that even his pores were relaxed.</p> <p>Suddenly, Yang Ling creased his brows and caution filled his heart. He had just opened his eyes when he saw a black arrow shooting toward him. Following that, a slender black figure entered through the window. Looking at the figure, he noticed that it was the female assassin who had failed her sneak attack on him previously.</p> <p>“Ah…” Looking at the female assassin who had suddenly appeared and the gleaming dagger, Alice lost her voice in shock, leaning tightly against Yang Ling’s bare back.</p> <p>Swallowing a huge gulp of his saliva, Yang Ling looked awkwardly at his lower body. It was lucky that he was in the water; otherwise, he would have exposed himself. He had not expected Alice’s breasts to feel this supple even though they did not look particularly impressive.</p> <p>“Hmph, give me your life!” The female assassin held her dagger in front of her and charged toward him like the wind. Her ice cold gaze and the gleaming dagger caused Alice’s skin to crawl.</p> <p>“You’re asking for death!”</p> <p>Yang Ling was not afraid. He made a hand gesture and summoned a Horned Bee Beast. In the blink of an eye, the female assassin was forced to evade the attacks, almost falling to the three lethal, poisonous stingers.</p> <p>Seeing his opponent being kept busy by the Horned Bee Beast, Yang Ling could not miss this opportunity. He let out a low grunt as he stood up, preparing to subdue his opponent. In that moment, two shrill cries came from within the bathroom.</p> <p>After dealing with the detestable Horned Bee Beast, the female assassin felt a mixture of shame and anger when she saw Yang Ling’s naked body. She had wanted to charge forward with her dagger, but she saw Horned Bee Beasts appearing out of thin air. She also heard footsteps coming toward the bathroom. She understood that she had lost the best opportunity, and she had no choice but to escape through the window after letting out a cold grunt.</p> <p>At the same time, Alice covered her eyes with her hands, her ears turning red. She had not expected Yang Ling to…</p> <p>“Ah, Yang Ling, you’re such a gangster!”</p> <p>Yang Ling had not even had the time to react when the door to the bathroom was pushed open. Sofia, who had come to check things out after hearing the commotion, had just looked in when she immediately turned her head away.</p> <p>Ah…</p> <p>After three more shrill female shrieks, a powerful male voice came from Yang Ling’s bathroom, causing the Barbarians who were patrolling the vicinity to shiver. They had long heard rumors that the nobles of the human race had perverted ways of playing with each other. It looked like those rumors were true indeed!</p>",
  "Chapter 23: The Pie that Fell from the Sky": "<p>After the incident with the assassin, in order to keep up his guard, Yang Ling increased the frequency and manpower of the patrol squads and arranged for undercover guards. At the same time, he ordered someone to build a hidden beehive in the largest pine tree in his yard. He stationed a team of Horned Bee Beasts there. This way, even if assassins were able to avoid the patrol team and undercover guards, it would be hard for them to avoid the Horned Bee Beasts and their astute sense of smell.</p> <p>Ever since the lackeys of the Anca family retreated back into their castle, the townspeople had finally managed to enjoy a few days of peace. The flow of traffic on the streets had also gradually increased. Be it on the streets or in the bar, many people were cursing the Anca family and the evil deeds they had committed over the years. They were also praising the generous Yang Ling.</p> <p>Because of Yang Ling, people who lived with him were also treated with the utmost respect. They need not queue for their meals, as people would make way for them when it got too crowded. Sometimes, people would even treat them to drinks when they visited the bar, much to the fancy of the thief Fenlist. Fenlist would head out from time to time and brag about how generous and powerful Yang Ling was, making it such that many wanted to work in Yang Ling’s manor.</p> <p>Seeing the tall, sturdy Barbarians, the expert archers from the elf tribe, and the swordsmen in Yang Ling’s manor, the townspeople were joyful, feeling an unprecedented sense of safety. They believed that as long as Yang Ling was around, the Anca family would not dare try anything too brazen. Only Yang Ling understood that this was merely the calm before the storm. The slower Ymir was with his revenge, the more prepared he would be when he struck.</p> <p>The Anca family castle was heavily guarded, with a guard stationed every five steps leading to the castle. Since he could not charge into the castle for the time being, all Yang Ling could do was make good use of his time and increase his abilities. He instructed Casey to continue gathering powerful swordsmen and troops. After he settled all the miscellaneous stuff in the manor, he headed back into the Terras Forest to train.</p> <p>Yang Ling felt right at home in Terras Forest. The air was fresh there, the surroundings green. Of course, there were also countless Magical Beasts of varying levels. When he was lucky, he could even chance upon an ancient tree with spiritual qualities.</p> <p>For some reason, the spiritual energy within Terras Forest was especially rich. Whenever he meditated up on a tree at night, Yang Ling would feel a blanket of spirit energy wash over him. As a result, his wizard powers would improve drastically. Just like that, by hunting with his Magical Beast army in the day and cultivating his Wizard Mantra at night, he unknowingly went further and further away from the edge of the forest.</p> <p>One day, after killing a few Iron Lizards and obtaining a few lychee-sized Blood Orbs, Yang Ling leapt to the tallest pine tree in the vicinity and sat with his legs crossed. He consumed the Blood Orbs and started silently chanting the Wizard Mantra, slowly circulating the wizard power within his body.</p> <p>While his wizard powers were circulating, Yang Ling instinctively made mysterious hand signs, his speed getting faster and faster. Slowly, the wizard powers flowing within his body became richer and richer, from a mere streak of water to a winding stream, then a roaring river formed by the merging of thousands of streams.</p> <p>At the same time, more and more spiritual energy gathered around Yang Ling, causing the trees around him to sway without the wind. From far away, the place Yang Ling was at seemed to be enveloped by a large fog.</p> <p>Some time later, Yang Ling, in his daze, heard the sounds of roaring and a pathetic cry coming from nearby. He opened his eyes to see a group of warriors and an enraged Unicorn engaging in a fierce battle on the ground near him.</p> <p>“Gors, Ice Frost Technique, quick, freeze it!” A warrior in navy blue armor was shouting as he rolled on the ground, narrowly avoiding the lightning-fast impact of the Unicorn.</p> <p>After being hit by a purple lightning that had appeared out of thin air, the charred spellcaster spat out a mouthful of blood. “Hanks, I have already exhausted all of my Magical Energy. Leave, leave quickly, don’t worry about me!”</p> <p>The unlucky spellcaster had just said this when his brain was split in two by the Unicorn that had charged over, his blood and brain matter spilling out. Even Yang Ling, who was hiding on the trees, felt his skin crawl, much less the warriors around them.</p> <p>Referring to the memories of the Horned Bee Beasts he controlled, Yang Ling understood how powerful the Unicorn before him was. It was a high-level Magical Beast. It not only had immense strength, it was also incredibly adept at light magic. There was no way an ordinary spellcaster could catch up to it, not even with a horse.</p> <p>“Quick, get into the formation, create the Magic Shield, quick!”</p> <p>With the shout of a heavily armored warrior, the other frightened warriors quickly got into a circular defensive formation, surrounding the rest of the pale spellcasters. At the same time, the spellcasters raised their right hands. A brown defensive veil appeared in front of them.</p> <p>Great Spellcasters, Great Swordsmen?</p> <p>Seeing the Battle Energy radiating from the swords of the warriors, seeing the thick Magic Shield conjured by the spellcasters, Yang Ling’s heart shook, and he nearly exclaimed in shock. A full twelve Great Swordsmen, five Great Spellcasters—they could massacre a city, much less hunt. It was no wonder that they would dare fight the terrifying Unicorn.</p> <p>The Unicorn released a thunderous snort. In its anger, the Unicorn charged forward at high speed, sometimes releasing frightening bolts of purple lightning. Under its manic attacks, the protective veil around the warriors shook wildly, groaning with every impact.</p> <p>Seeing the manic Unicorn, Hanks could not help but wipe the cold sweat off his forehead. “Brothers, it has been almost thirty minutes; I think that Miss and the rest will have successfully returned to Wissen Town. We have completed our mission. The protective barrier won’t last much longer. Split up and run for your lives, then report back at Wissen Town!”</p> <p>“Hanks… Hanks, run with the rest!” An elder dressed in a black robe stood up slowly. He spat out a mouthful of blood before saying, “I am now old and useless; I can’t run. Furthermore, it’s about time for an old man like me to go visit my partner. The barrier won’t last longer; leave now, I will be behind you!”</p> <p>After letting out a loud shout, the old man gripped his staff and began reciting an incantation. Quickly, a massive amount of Magical Energy gathered beside him.</p> <p>After hearing the mysterious chants of the elder, the expressions of the people around him changed drastically, especially the rest of the Great Spellcasters. They understood the meaning of the old man’s actions, and their faces were laced with tears.</p> <p>“Brothers, run, run quickly, don’t waste this kind gesture of Master Gibson!” Looking at the elder who was halfway through his incantation, the heavily armored Hanks understood that there was no turning back now. He bowed with teary eyes, then started running away. Behind him, the rest of the spellcasters clenched their teeth and cast an acceleration spell on themselves and the rest of the warriors before following Hanks with tears in their eyes.</p> <p>The Unicorn felt uneasy when it saw the group charge out of the barrier. As a high-level Magical Beast, it understood that the elder in the barrier was charging up a terrifying spell. It did not dare act recklessly, but seeing the rest of the group escape farther and farther away, it felt like it was being robbed.</p> <p>After a moment’s hesitation, the Unicorn let out a roar before chasing after the group with full speed. But it had just started running when the brown barrier scattered into the wind. Following that, an incredible explosion tore apart that section of the forest, with the old man at the center.</p> <p>“Gibson…” Looking back at the magnificent explosion, Hanks led the group to kneel, tears covering his face. After clenching his teeth, he led the rest of the group to escape.</p> <p>A long time later, after the dust has settled, a meteor-like crater had been formed in the ground. Yang Ling searched hard, but he could not find any traces of the elder. He might have been obliterated by that blast. But unexpectedly, he found the Unicorn under a large tree, covered in blood, its eyes glazed and without life, its breathing shallow. It might not have much longer to live.</p> <p>Yang Ling cautiously looked at the heavily injured Unicorn. The Unicorn also tried its best to open its eyes to look at Yang Ling. They looked at each other silently for a few minutes. Slowly, two streaks of tears laced with blood began to fall from the eyes of the Unicorn. It might have been an illusion, but Yang Ling seemed to be able to sense a boundless sadness and anger, as well as a shred of injustice, from its eyes.</p> <p>Grief, sadness, injustice?</p> <p>Looking at the nearly dead, motionless Unicorn, then looking at its tears, Yang Ling understood that this was a high-level Magical Beast that possessed intelligence. After a moment’s hesitation, he bit his index finger and placed it gently on the creature’s head.</p>",
  "Chapter 24: A Thousand-Mile Pursuit": "<p>There were several tents set up in the northeastern corner of Wissen Town, near the edge of the Terras Forest. If any people had walked past the area, they would definitely have noticed the image of a golden chariot flying over a vast plain stitched into the top of each tent. The material of the tents was thick and shiny, all brushed with a layer of waterproof tree sap. From far away, the tents looked like individual green wooden houses.</p> <p>An average person would use the sky as their blanket and the ground as their bed when they went to the outdoors. It was a luxury just having a sleeping bag with them. Even the bosses of merchant organizations who were expanding toward other areas of the continent would only be able to afford one or two simple tents.</p> <p>The lifelike golden chariots and magnificent waterproof tents all alluded to the identity of the owner of the tents. He or she was either insanely rich or royalty!</p> <p>At this time, there were faint sounds of conversation coming from the largest tent. There were two fierce warriors guarding the door. If someone were to see this, they would definitely be shocked. Just who was inside the tent, for both the guards to be Great Swordsmen?</p> <p>“Harribell, it is time to move. If we do not leave now…” An elder dressed in a gray robe was worried, his face pale. There were traces of blood all over his body, as if he had just undergone a huge battle.</p> <p>“Master Grain, this thing is so little… Is its Essence Crystal really that useful?” A veiled young lady sighed, softly stroking the puppy-sized Unicorn in her embrace.</p> <p>The expression of the gray robed elder sank when he heard the young lady. He heaved a heavy sigh. No one could truly guarantee the usefulness of the Essence Crystal of the little Unicorn, but it was not easy to capture a fully mature Unicorn. They had already paid a heavy price in trying to capture the little foal. Seven or eight of their elite warriors had fallen in battle, and even Master Gibson had paid for their escape with his life.</p> <p>“Miss, it is all my fault. The ambush failed, and we even lost Master Gibson.” Hanks’s head was wrapped in a thick layer of bandages. After taking a sip of strong liquor, he lifted the heavy sword in his hands and said fiercely, “Even if I have to give up my life, I have to return to the Terras Forest and kill a mature Unicorn. My life was given to me by the Earl; without him, I would have been reduced to a pile of soil twenty years ago!”</p> <p>“Yes, for the Earl, we will go all out!”</p> <p>“Miss, give the order!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Under Hanks’s lead, the group of brave warriors stood up.</p> <p>Seeing the blood-covered warriors, then looking at the exhausted Great Spellcasters, the young lady shook her head. There were many Magical Beasts prowling deep in the Terras Forest. A Level Eight high-level Magical Beast like the Unicorn had terrifying abilities and a fleeting nature. The fact that Unicorns rarely staid in one place for a long time made them hard to capture, even when the hunters were at full strength, much less now, after suffering many casualties.</p> <p>“I, Harribell, accept the goodwill of all of you. But the Terras Forest is dangerous; how can I make you all take the risk and enter the forest once again?” The veiled young lady’s eyes were red. She continued, “My family is blessed for having the assistance of you brave warriors. I, Harribell, want to express my heartfelt gratitude for all of you, whether or not we are able to save my father’s life this time!”</p> <p>“Harribell, we must not tarry; let’s go, let’s leave now. Let’s hope to be able to return to Montson in three days!” The gray-robed elder had a gloomy expression. “If we cannot return before the illness inflicting your father acts up, then we might lose even this glimmer of a chance!”</p> <p>Hearing the gray-robed elder’s words, the veiled young lady became even more worried. She made a quick decision and instructed the group to move out immediately. But just as the group stood up, they heard a deafening roar coming from far away. Following that, the sounds of galloping could be heard, as if a fast horse was charging toward them.</p> <p>It was the middle of the night. Was it a knight passing by, or a Magical Beast searching for food?</p> <p>Hearing the sound become clearer and clearer, the group was confused. This was the outer perimeter of the Terras Forest, and there were not many Magical Beasts here. This place was also far away from the residential area of Wissen Town. Not many people came to these parts even during the day, much less in the middle of the night. Just what was going on?</p> <p>Neigh…</p> <p>After listening intently for a moment, the little Unicorn in the arms of the veiled young lady neighed loudly and struggled. At the same time, after hearing the cries of the little foal, the roars outside became louder, the hoofbeats more hurried, the sounds clearer.</p> <p>The gray-robed elder had a thought when he saw the struggling little foal. He shouted in worry, “Not good! A Unicorn has come here following the scent! Quick, charge outside, get into formation, quickly!”</p> <p>Hearing the shouts of the gray-robed elder, the group reacted instantly, charging outside without much hesitation. After experiencing these days of pursuit, everyone understood that only by getting into formation could they have a chance of escaping with their lives. Otherwise, they were going to get slaughtered by the terrifying Unicorn.</p> <p>“Miss, your sword!” In a fluster, a maid carried over the veiled lady’s sword. She shivered when she thought about the warriors whose heads were trampled on by the Unicorn.</p> <p>After handing the little Unicorn to the maid, the veiled lady withdrew her sharp longsword. She said with a deep tone, “Mary, do not be afraid, we have the advantage in numbers. After the battle is over, remember to stay by my side. Do not run away in a fluster!”</p> <p>As a Magical Swordsman, even though Harribell was extremely nervous, she was not as lost as the maid Mary, who did not have any Battle Energy. With Hanks’s help, she instructed the warriors to quickly get into a tight circle-like defensive formation.</p> <p>Wissen Town experienced heavy rainfall, and its nights were often cloaked in thick fog. The roars of the Unicorn came closer and closer, but the thick fog hid its figure, despite the fact that they could hear its cries clearly. Staring into the thick fog, the group became more nervous. The hurried hoofbeats of the Unicorn felt like the sounds of death, causing their nerves to be strung taut.</p> <p>“Miss, I…” Hearing the thunderous claps of the hooves, seeing the gleaming swords all around her, the maid nearly suffocated in her own nervousness. She stayed close behind the veiled young lady.</p> <p>“Hanks, if the situation gets too dire later on, leave first with Miss. You must not try to play the hero!” The gray-robed elder instructed softly as he stepped up beside Hanks. They had been unable to deal with the crazed attacks of the Unicorn even when they were at full strength; now that they were left with injured and exhausted fighters, how were they going to withstand its assault? They had no choice but to sacrifice themselves to protect their master.</p> <p>Neigh…</p> <p>The Unicorn suddenly stopped when it was a mere hundred steps away from them. It paused for a moment before taking small steps toward them.</p> <p>Thud, thud, thud…</p> <p>Hearing the heavy, powerful footsteps, feeling a soaring killing intent, the group began to drop cold sweat. They clenched the weapons in their hands tightly, not daring to breathe.</p> <p>Following a wave of footsteps, the Unicorn slowly closed in from the fog. Its red eyes, its lone horn covered in purple arcs of lightning, and the looming weight of its desire to kill all made the group incredibly afraid.</p> <p>“Hand over the little Unicorn, or else you will all die!”</p> <p>Just as the gray-robed elder and the Great Spellcasters were about to cast the Magic Shield, the figure of a young man slowly appeared above the Unicorn. He had a piercing gaze and an emotionless face. Even though they could not feel any ripples of Magical Power or Battle Energy coming from his body, they did not dare let down their guard.</p> <p>After successfully taming the heavily injured Unicorn, Yang Ling had quickly understood the situation through its memories. He understood why the Unicorn felt this much grief and injustice as it was dying. He had tried his best to heal the Unicorn as he followed the scent of its child.</p>",
  "Chapter 25: The Veiled Young Lady": "<p>A Sword Saint, or a Holy Magical Tutor?</p> <p>Only a Sword Saint or a Holy Magical Tutor could mask their Battle Energy or ripples of Magical Energy. Also, only an extraordinarily powerful fighter of those classes could easily capture a high-level Magical Beast like the Unicorn and use it as his battle pet.</p> <p>Looking at Yang Ling sitting coldly atop the Unicorn, the group sighed. They would have found it hard to deal with the might of a single Unicorn. Now that there was a Sword Saint or Holy Magical Tutor in front of them, his abilities powerful beyond imagination, leaving this place alive would be impossible.</p> <p>After swallowing hard, the elder in gray tried his luck and said, “Sir, this is the first time we have set foot in the Terras Forest. Could you have mistaken us for somebody else, or could there be some misunderstanding between us?”</p> <p>Even though the gray-robed elder could not sense any Battle Energy or ripples of Magical Energy coming from Yang Ling despite using a hidden detection spell, he noticed that there was a strange power coming from within the man’s body, preventing his mental powers from infiltrating any further. It looked like even if the other party was not a Sword Saint or Holy Magical Tutor, he would still be a troublesome foe.</p> <p>“Hmph, misunderstanding?” Yang Ling grunted, his ice-cold gaze sweeping past the faces of the group, finally landing on the struggling little Unicorn. “You trespassed into my territory and stole a newborn little Unicorn, yet you call this a misunderstanding?”</p> <p>They had accidentally trespassed into his territory?</p> <p>The group was immensely shocked. The Terras Forest spanned thousands of miles. Even though the outer parts of the forest were occupied by races such as elves, dwarves, and barbarians, they had never heard that areas deep within the forest had been occupied by someone. Could this young man be some old monster that could not die?</p> <p>Some Sword Saints and Holy Magical Tutors could live up to a thousand years. It was rumored that there were three such Sword Saints who had lived upwards of a thousand years guarding the Rossi Empire. For them, maintaining eternal youth or altering their appearances was not something that was particularly difficult.</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, the veiled lady said slowly, with her sharp sword in her hand, “Sir, we found this newborn Unicorn in an ordinary cave. We also did not notice any traces made by humans. Could there really be a misunderstanding between us?”</p> <p>Because of the terrifying Unicorn and the undetectable abilities of Yang Ling, the veiled young lady adopted a sincere attitude. She was afraid that she would accidentally offend the young man who had obviously come for revenge. Unless she had no choice, she was very unwilling to fight against such a mysterious person.</p> <p>There were multiple ways to approach such a situation!</p> <p>Looking at the perky breasts of the veiled lady, then at her slender thighs and her barely visible, beautiful face, Yang Ling could not help but steal another look. Unlike the understanding Alice or the friendly Sofia, the lady before him had a unique demeanor. She gave off a special aura. She was prim and proper, and she had a little trace of cold arrogance.</p> <p>“Hehe, what do you know about being one with nature?” Yang Ling had a thought. He secretly recited a verse from the mysterious Wizard Mantra, then said coldly, “Must I erect an opulent palace and hire a hundred servants to serve me to signify that the place is my territory?”</p> <p>After recovering in the Wizard’s Tower over the past two days, the powerful Unicorn had nearly regained all of its strength. Even though the other party had the advantage in numbers, Yang Ling believed that he could retreat successfully even if things went wrong, based on the powerful abilities of the Unicorn and his own Magical Beast army. That was the reason he was so composed. He deduced that the young lady and her group were either rich or from a noble family. He might be able to extort them for a sum of money after retrieving the baby Unicorn.</p> <p>Even though it was a little ridiculous, the veiled young lady paused after she heard what Yang Ling said. Rumors had it that many powerful fighters such as Sword Saints and Holy Magical Tutors were a little eccentric, many opting to live simple lives and become one with nature. Perhaps this was the case with the young man before them.</p> <p>“Oh lord, this is the Unicorn that pursued us all this time! It should have perished with Gibson when he used the explosion. How could it have recovered this quickly?”</p> <p>Just as the group was confused, Hanks lost his voice in shock when he noticed the scar on the Unicorn’s left foot. Even if the Unicorn were to be reduced to ash, he would definitely remember that deep wound. If not for his guard Burfack risking his life and slashing at the Unicorn’s hoof, he would definitely have been reduced to mincemeat under its rampant attacks.</p> <p>The Unicorn that should have perished with Gibson?</p> <p>The expressions of the group became even grimmer after the realization. If a Great Spellcaster was able to successfully cast the Explosion Spell before he died, the power of the explosion would often invite the caution of an average Sword Saint. They would never have expected the Unicorn, which was at the center of the explosion, to not only still be alive, but completely recover its health in the short span of just two days. This showed them the power of the abilities of the young man before them.</p> <p>“Hehe, that’s right, this was the Unicorn you people heavily injured!” Stroking the uneasy Unicorn, Yang Ling said coldly, “If not for my prompt arrival, this partner who has been through thick and thin with me would have died in your hands, hmph!”</p> <p>Since the other party had misunderstood his identity, Yang Ling decided to exaggerate the situation even more. The other party must have powerful abilities, since they were clearly not an ordinary group of troops or explorers. They should be nobles. If Yang Ling did not seize the opportunity to extort them, he would feel that he had let himself down.</p> <p>In his second year of college, Yang Ling was lucky enough to attend a seminar conducted by an expert in military defense. Before the expert ended the seminar, he had said something that stuck in Yang Ling’s heart. America was powerful not only because of its powerful military defense and economy; what was more important was that they used the art of psychological warfare perfectly, and they were usually able to achieve their goals on the negotiation table.</p> <p>Risks would have to be taken to acquire riches. Even though the other party had the numbers advantage, with many Great Swordsmen and Great Spellcasters in their group, Yang Ling was willing to take the gamble. He was gambling that they could not discern his abilities, gambling that they wouldn’t dare to act recklessly. He was gambling for the greatest returns.</p> <p>“Sir, this is all my fault, it has nothing to do with them!” Misunderstanding Yang Ling’s abilities, the veiled young lady understood that they did not stand a chance of winning against their opponent. She made the fast decision and said directly, “In order to cure my father’s illness, I had no choice but to employ such an evil tactic. I am not asking for your forgiveness, but please spare these innocent warriors!”</p> <p>After she said this, the veiled lady picked up the little Unicorn in the maid’s embrace and placed it softly on the ground. With its newfound freedom, the little foal immediately galloped toward Yang Ling, shoving itself against its mother’s legs.</p> <p>“Miss, what are we going to do about the Earl’s injuries now that you have released the little Unicorn?” Seeing the little Unicorn they had worked so hard to capture running back to its mother, the heavily armored Hanks’s eyes turned red. He lifted his sword high into the air and said fiercely, “Miss, leave now. I, Hanks, will not return to Montson without obtaining the Essence Crystal of a Unicorn!”</p> <p>“Miss, fight against him!”</p> <p>“Miss, you have to consider!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing the veiled lady release the little Unicorn they had worked so hard to capture in order to save their lives, the warriors all knelt. They understood that the lady carried a Teleportation Scroll on her and could move to safety whenever she wanted. What she did just now was for the safety of the warriors of her family.</p> <p>Calm and composed, swift and decisive!</p> <p>Yang Ling was surprised when he saw how decisive the veiled lady was. An average young lady would have lost their cool when faced with such a situation, but she had been able to deal with the situation with such composure. He had only seen such spirit in successful females on television. It looked like the identities of this group of people were not simple indeed.</p> <p>“Great, but unfortunately, you have done something foolish!” People of such a status would usually have a great deal of money, so how could Yang Ling bear to miss such an opportunity to fleece them? He said coldly, “Because of your foolishness, you have caused me to waste a bottle of Water of the Spring of Life. You have also interrupted my five-year meditation. How are you going to compensate me?”</p> <p>Water of the Spring of Life?</p> <p>The group was shocked. It was no wonder that the Unicorn had been able to fully recover in just two days!</p> <p>Recovering from her shock, the veiled lady charged forward in agitation. “Sir, my poor father’s life is hanging by a thread! As long as you are willing to give me a bottle, no, half a bottle of Water of the Spring of Life, I am willing to pay any price!”</p> <p>As per its name, consuming the Water of the Spring of Life would be able to cure the most serious of injuries. The reason Harribell had risked leading a group of warriors into the forest to hunt Unicorns and obtain their Essence Crystals was in the hope of saving her father’s life. Now that she heard that Yang Ling had the Water of the Spring of Life, how could she afford to miss this opportunity?</p>",
  "Chapter 26: Troubles Lie Ahead": "<p>He had gone too far with the lie!</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head and let out a bitter smile when he saw the group of warriors kneeling before him. The so-called story about saving the Unicorn with a bottle of Water from the Spring of Life was nonsense he made up. How was he going to find the Water from the Spring of Life for them?</p> <p>“Sir, our family controls the Boulade Merchant’s Association. Even though it is not the largest merchant’s association on the continent, we enjoy business from all around the world and have in our possession many crystal and gemstone mines. As long as you are willing to give us half a bottle of the Water from the Spring of Life, I, Harribell, would be forever in your debt!” Seeing Yang Ling hesitate and not say a word, the veiled lady’s eyes became teary from worry.</p> <p>She raised her hand and signaled for the elder, who seemed to be the housekeeper, to come over. Harribell then whispered instructions into his ear. The latter hesitated for a moment before muttering a few words. Quickly, he conjured a large amount of treasures from a magic space. There were crates of crystal coins, sacks of Dark Fire Crystals, and bags of sparkling gemstones.</p> <p>Rich people, and not just any ordinary rich people!</p> <p>There were many news stories about Arab millionaires and their spending habits on the television and the Internet. But this was the first time Yang Ling was witnessing someone willing to part with this many treasures in one transaction. The other party sure lived up to their reputation of having many crystal and gemstone mines under their control. Their eyebrows didn’t even crease when they conjured this obscene amount of money.</p> <p>“Sir, this is the Purple Orchid Badge of the Magic Association of the Livenza Alliance. With this, you can pass unobstructed throughout the fifteen countries in the alliance. You would even receive the support of the Magic Associations within the fifteen member countries!” After clenching his teeth, the gray-robed elder took out a Purple Orchid Badge from within his robes and continued, “I hope that you would be so forgiving as to overlook our mistakes and save Harribell’s father.”</p> <p>Seeing the teary veiled lady, then looking at the sincere gray-robed elder and the group of warriors, Yang Ling understood that they had all placed their hopes on him. Unfortunately, he had been lying through his teeth just now. How was he going to find the Water of the Spring of Life for them?</p> <p>Could he pass off a bottle of spring water as the real thing?</p> <p>Yang Ling had that idea when he recalled the sweet spring water near the elf tribe. But he hesitated when he met the red, swollen eyes of the pitiful veiled lady looking at him hopefully.</p> <p>“Sir, I am begging you. Please take pity on my father who has spent his entire life in toil. Even though he has built up an empire, he has not had the time to enjoy the fruits of his labor; instead, he was nearly assassinated by a despicable man. Sir, please save my father! Harribell is willing to pay any price!” Seeing Yang Ling’s silence, the veiled lady could not hold it in any longer. Her tears welled out in her anxiety.</p> <p>Looking at the crying Harribell, then thinking about their old master whose life was in danger, the eyes of the warriors also turned red, tears tracing down their faces. This was especially so for the rigid maid. She hugged the young lady she had served for all these years and broke into tears. Ever since the old master turned ill, the young lady had taken the helm of the association for three years now, but she had never seen the young lady break down or cry no matter how bad the situation got. Now that the young lady was crying so pitifully, one could see how sad the maid must have felt too!</p> <p>Willing to pay any price?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head, as if he was looking at fat sheep ready for slaughter. Unfortunately, he had already exhausted his supply of the Water from the Spring of Life. Otherwise, he would definitely extort these people. But it was not bad to be able to receive the pile of treasures before him.</p> <p>“Forget it, I shall not pursue things any further considering that you did this because of your filial piety. But there will be no next times!” After absorbing the treasures before him into his Space Ring, Yang Ling said coldly, “Because of your foolishness, I have exhausted all of the Water from the Spring of Life I had on me to heal the injured Unicorn. These things shall be my compensation!”</p> <p>Yang Ling had already successfully accomplished what he set out to do in saving the little Unicorn, and he had even received a small windfall. He instructed the Unicorn to turn away and leave in case there were any complications. Otherwise, it would become troublesome if the other party managed to guess his abilities.</p> <p>The larger the hope, the greater the disappointment!</p> <p>When they had captured the little Unicorn, the veiled lady had already been uneasy, wondering if the Essence Crystal of the little creature would have any effect. After knowing that Yang Ling possessed the Water from the Spring of Life, she finally saw hope that her father’s illness could be cured. But she did not expect to be let down again. The hope of curing her father’s illness instantly became slim and far away again.</p> <p>Just as the group became dejected again, Hanks suddenly lifted his sword and charged toward Yang Ling, blocking his path of escape. “Sir, if you do not have the Water from the Spring of Life, then leave the little Unicorn behind. I’ll fight you to the death! Everything is my fault. If I cannot save the old master, then I, Hanks, will have lost my will to live!”</p> <p>As the personal bodyguard of the old master, Hanks had always been incredibly remorseful that he had not blocked the poison-soaked dagger used by the assailant three years ago. Seeing the last shred of hope they had being broken just like that, he had decided to go all out.</p> <p>“Hanks, you must not act recklessly, come back, quick!” The gray-robed elder lost color in his face when he saw Hanks blocking the way of the mysterious person. If Yang Ling were to become furious and unleash a massacre, there was a possibility that no one here would live to see another day, much less successfully take back the little Unicorn.</p> <p>Despite the word of caution of the gray-robed Elder, Hanks remained unmoved. What was more unexpected was that the rest of the group of warriors also charged forward, surrounding Yang Ling, who was riding on the Unicorn. Without the Water of the Spring of Life, the Unicorn was the last shred of hope they had in reversing the old master’s condition.</p> <p>Seeing the warriors charging toward him, Yang Ling admired their loyalty, but belittled their foolishness. Because they had surrounded him recklessly, the lightning released by the Unicorn he was riding might be enough to turn them all into ash.</p> <p>“Brave warriors, don’t put him in a spot, come back!” Harribell allowed the cold wind to blow away the veil on her face. She wiped off her tears in despair. “Mary, let’s go, let us return home, return home…”</p> <p>As she was helped onto a Silver-winged Pegasus, Harribell looked back in despair at Yang Ling on the Unicorn. She moved her reins and prepared to leave. The abilities of the other party were deep beyond their understanding, and the abilities of the Unicorn was also terrifying. Risking it all would only pointlessly increase their casualties. Since that was the case, the best course of action would be to return to her ill father’s side and silently wait on him until his last days.</p> <p>The worst sorrow was not as bad as an uncaring heart!</p> <p>Just as Harribell looked toward him, Yang Ling’s heart shook. What kind of gaze was that? Grief, despair… Her delicate face was covered in tears, her slender figure slumped helplessly on the Pegasus, as if she had lost all her strength.</p> <p>Seeing Harribell about to leave, Yang Ling suddenly had an idea. He recalled that the elves from his tribe had asked for help from the neighboring tribes. Perhaps they might have brought back some Water from the Spring of Life.</p> <p>“Miss Harribell, wait a moment!” Yang Ling deliberated for a moment before continuing, “I really do not have any Water from the Spring of Life on me right now, but since your father is critically ill, I have decided that it is good karma to save someone’s life. I can help you ask my friends if they have any!”</p> <p>“Sir, is what you speak true?” In her surprise, Harribell jumped off her Pegasus instantly.</p> <p>“I have not seen them for a long time, and I do not know if my friends have any Water from the Spring of Life in their possession! If I have not returned in five hours, then you need not wait any longer!” After a pause, Yang Ling continued, “Of course, the Water of the Spring of Life is incredibly rare. If I am lucky enough to find any, then I hope that you will compensate my friends accordingly.”</p> <p>The other party was very willing to part with their money, and Yang Ling would never miss such a great opportunity to ask for treasure that was multiple times what he had received just now. The treasures he would ask for would be worth multiple bottles of the Water from the Spring of Life, much less one. Furthermore, they claimed to be the owners of the Boulade Merchant’s Association, which had business from all over the world. If he could get on friendly terms with them, he might be able to receive benefits in the future.</p> <p>After picking the little Unicorn up, Yang Ling did not say any more. He left quickly on his Unicorn. It was definitely worth the trip for the obscene amounts of treasure. The other party was willing to part with such a large amount of treasure at one time. He would definitely be able to extort them for even more.</p> <p>Yang Ling rushed to the elf tribe. At the same time, an unprecedented storm was brewing in a dark secret room.</p> <p>“Young master, why not wait for the master to come back before discussing this further!” Goode, who was dressed in a black robe, softly warned Ymir.</p> <p>“Hmph, wait, we would become tortoises if we wait any longer!” Recalling the humiliation Yang Ling gave to his family, Ymir clenched his teeth. “Even Sword Saints have to hide from the sharpness of this Divine Weapon passed on through the generations of the Anca family. Hmph, I’ll see where that lad can run to this time!”</p> <p>After a moment’s hesitation, Goode creased his brows and said, “Wouldn’t it be more troublesome if the envoy sent by the Church were to notice the secrets of this Divine Weapon?”</p> <p>“Hmph, I’ll just kill the envoy of the Church when the time comes!” Slicing open his wrist, Ymir clenched his teeth as he allowed the blood to drop onto a pitch-black magic spell. He said fiercely, “That blasted Summoner, I’ll definitely capture you and torture you slowly. When I’m done with you, you’ll wish that you were dead!”</p> <p>Under the faint light of the flames, Ymir’s ferocious expression looked even more frightening.</p>",
  "Chapter 27: Evening Primrose": "<p>The elves broke into a commotion when they saw Yang Ling return to the tribe on a Unicorn. The Unicorn was a high-level Magical Beast of the light attribute, rumored to be the ride of the Goddess of Nature, naturally blessed by her. Owning a Unicorn was the dream of every elf tribe.</p> <p>After engaging in the formalities with the elf elder, Yang Ling quickly approached the main question. Coincidentally, an elf from the elf tribe two thousand kilometers away had delivered a small bottle of Water from the Spring of Life.</p> <p>After obtaining the Water from the Spring of Life, Yang Ling grabbed a bunch of dates to alleviate his hunger and headed out, his movements hurried. He had just got on the Unicorn when he had an idea. He asked for a small empty bottle from the elf elder and carefully poured half of the Water of the Spring of Life into it. He only required half a bottle of the Water from the Spring of Life to save the young lady’s father. The rest of the water would be useful in the future. It could not only improve his own wizard powers, it could also boost the evolution of his Magical Beasts. It was not wise to waste it.</p> <p>The Unicorn was incredibly fast, much faster than the Gryphon. If the Gryphon was to be compared to the Boeing 737, then the Unicorn would be a rocket. Yang Ling had arrived at the edge of the Terras Forest in just a little over four hours.</p> <p>“Sir, did you get the Water of the Spring of Life?” Seeing Yang Ling return this quickly, Harribell felt ill with unease.</p> <p>Stroking the little Unicorn in his arms, Yang Ling let out a long sigh. He feigned hesitation, then took out half a bottle of the Water of the Spring of Life before slowly saying, “It was not easy to snatch half a bottle of this water from that old drunkard. Miss Harribell, take it!”</p> <p>“Sir, thank you for your generosity. Please tell me if you need anything!” As the acting leader of the Boulade Merchant’s Organization, Harribell had exceptional observational skills. She took the initiative and asked Yang Ling what he wanted as she took the Water from the Spring of Life.</p> <p>“Well, the old drunkard thinks that booze is more important than his life. Only good wine could allow him to part with a treasure like this. If it is convenient for you, then please get him a few expert winemakers!” How could Yang Ling miss such an opportunity? He continued, “Also, I have opened a small weapons shop in Wissen Town. If it’s possible, can you get me a few expert metalsmiths?”</p> <p>The other party was very willing to part with their money. Yang Ling understood that even if he did not explicitly say it, he would also receive a large amount of money and gems. He would rather get them to send him expert winemakers and craftsmen than a large amount of good wine and weapons. Ever since he arrived at the refreshing Terras Forest from the terrible environment that was Earth, he could not forget about the sweet spring water and rich resources he had found here. Setting up a distillery here, as long as he had his techniques right, would definitely produce wines of much better quality than whatever garbage they had back on Earth.</p> <p>Since he had no way of going back, there was no use grumbling about his fate. Ever since he had arrived in this foreign world, Yang Ling had hoped that he could enjoy a new life here. After all, even if money couldn’t solve every problem, it was not possible to live without money. Clearly, setting up a unique distillery in the town was not a bad business idea.</p> <p>Winemakers and metalsmiths?</p> <p>Harribell looked unexpectedly at the mysterious, powerful Yang Ling. But after having countless experiences handling the association, she was no longer the carefree young lady she was three years ago. She quickly came to her senses and said, “Do not worry sir, I will definitely make the arrangements. Please wait for our good news!”</p> <p>Time was of the essence. After quickly coming to an agreement, Harribell bade her farewells to Yang Ling and left on her Silver-winged Pegasus. Other than the heavily armored Hanks and the housekeeper, the rest of the warriors followed behind her on horses. Quickly, the group disappeared within the forest.</p> <p>After a few formalities, Yang Ling took Hanks and the housekeeper Murbaqi back to the dwarves weapon in town and settled them down. With them as his correspondence, Yang Ling was not worried. He believed that Harribell would send him his large present soon.</p> <p>Indeed, Harribell acted fast. A little over ten days later, Hanks and Murbaqi brought over a large group of people and horses. Other than the dozen crates of jewelry, they also brought a few hundred barrels of incredible wine, ten expert winemakers, and fifteen experienced metalsmiths. Amongst them, there was also a young man who called himself the royal winemaker of the Banto Empire.</p> <p>Glancing over at the pile of gifts, Yang Ling instructed Alice to put away the more precious items such as the crystal coins, jewelry, and Dark Fire Crystals. He then tasked the old housekeeper Murbaqi with the miscellaneous stuff such, as settling the people and the banquet.</p> <p>Following that, Murbaqi showed Yang Ling what true housekeeping was. Under his planning and instructions, the people took their positions in a quick and orderly fashion. Some people renovated the premises, some gathered ingredients in Wissen Town, and the experienced winemakers and metalsmiths also became busy.</p> <p>Quickly, the first distillery in Wissen Town had been set up. It had an area of about ten hectares and was situated not far from the weapons shop. The distillery took the back of the area, while the front was occupied by a bar. It also had a poetic name—Evening Primrose.</p> <p>The Evening Primrose Bar had two levels. The first level was mainly to entertain ordinary citizens and troops. The floor was paved with marble they found from the stone manufacturing plant nearby, the walls and ceiling were constructed from high-quality wood. Air circulated nicely in the building, and it had ample light. Other than that, there was also a small dance stage set up near the center of the hall for poets or performers who had come to the bar.</p> <p>Different from the first level, the second level of the bar was mainly targeted at the rich. The floors and walls were all made with Purple Sandalwood sourced from deep within the Terras Forest. The ceiling was dotted with crystals and gems of varying sizes. They would sparkle when the sky became darker, just like the stars in the sky, captivating and romantic. Accompanied by the evening primrose decorating the corner of the bar, Yang Ling believed that this would be tempting to young people and rich ladies who enjoyed a romantic atmosphere.</p> <p>There were only about twenty thousand people residing in Wissen Town, but because of its rich resources, the town also attracted many troops, explorers, spellcasters, and even dubious people like thieves. As the weather was comfortable here, the town also drew nobles from the Banto Empire and Livenza Alliance to hunt or take a holiday here from time to time.</p> <p>Yang Ling believed that with the natural advantage brought about by the Terras Forest, the population of Wissen Town would grow. As long as he managed the dwarves’ weapon shop and this bar carefully, he would definitely be able to earn a good income. Even though it would not reach the level of Harribell and her crystal and gemstone mines, it was much better than being a sales architect in a small company back on Earth, worrying about his day to day expenses.</p> <p>Under the old housekeeper’s efforts, the Evening Primrose Bar quickly opened for business.</p> <p>“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the opening day of the first distillery in Wissen Town, as well as the opening day of the Evening Primrose Bar. All the wine here will be on a fifty percent discount today!”</p> <p>Seeing the townspeople swarm toward his bar, Yang Ling excitedly raised the glass in his hands. Most of the townspeople in Wissen Town were hunters or wood gatherers, their personalities forthright. A good portion of them were also alcoholics. As long as the distillery and the bar operated normally, they would definitely be his gold mine.</p> <p>Even though they could not come up with any new wine for the time being, Yang Ling believed that with the rich resources in the Terras Forest, as well as his expert winemakers, he could one day discover whiskey, brandy, Maotai, and other delicious alcohols.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, this is good wine!”</p> <p>“Oh, Raphael Red Wine from the Rossi Empire, my god, to think that I get to drink Raphael Red Wine here!”</p> <p>“Tsk tsk, great wine. The wine is fragrant, the people even more so!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>After taking a sip of the free wine Yang Ling offered at the entrance, the people were shocked, all entering the bar to find a seat. They were afraid that there would not be any seats left if they waited.</p> <p>In order to attract attention, Yang Ling resorted to a strategy he had used before, getting a few slender elves from the elf tribe to act as the service staff. Indeed, the slender figures, beautiful faces, long legs… The crowd once again broke into a rowdy commotion.</p> <p>A few drunkards, in their drunken stupor, took sips of wine as they looked at the captivating elf beauties. They looked at one, then stole peeks at the other, but none of them dared try anything funny after they had witnessed Yang Ling’s abilities. No one thought that the two nearly-three-meter barbarians at the door were merely decorations.</p>",
  "Chapter 28: The Butt That Caused All the Trouble": "<p>“Get lost, get your boss out here!” Just as the crowd was at the height of their excitement, a loud shout came suddenly from outside the door.</p> <p>Could it be that there was another arrogant Great Swordsman here to receive humiliation?</p> <p>Doubtfully, the crowd gathered outside. They saw a black-robed warrior standing in the middle of the street, looking rather stoic. He had a heavy sword strapped beside his waist, and he was wearing leopard print boots. He stared at Yang Ling, who was walking outside slowly.</p> <p>“Hmph, under the orders of master Ymir, I am here to invite you to a duel to the death three days from now in the Ladoja Valley. Please come on time!” After tossing the written letter of challenge toward Yang Ling, the black-robed warrior turned to leave.</p> <p>A duel to the death?</p> <p>After understanding what was going on, Yang Ling let out a cold grunt and said coldly, “Haha, wait up, do you think you can leave just like that?”</p> <p>Yang Ling had just said this when ten heavily armored barbarians swarmed forward, blocking the path of the black-robed warrior. The tire-sized axes in their hands shone with a cold light. At the same time, the crowd also began to come to their senses.</p> <p>“Kill him!”</p> <p>“D*mn it, finish this shameless lackey!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, dig out his black heart and pickle it in wine!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Under the influence of alcohol, the crowd shouted rowdily, expressing their disdain for the Anca family, each fiercer than the last.</p> <p>Looking at the bloodthirsty barbarians, then at the furious townspeople surrounding him, the expression of the black-robed warrior changed faster than the weather. He no longer dared keep up his pretense, and instead said uneasily, “Sir, do you have any instructions for me?”</p> <p>Seeing the black-robed warrior growing pale, Yang Ling smiled and said, “Haha, you should take some presents back since you have already taken the time to come all the way here. Help me give my respects to your master Ymir. Tell him that I wish him good health and a long life, oh and a butt that grows plumper every year!”</p> <p>A butt that grows plumper every year?</p> <p>After freezing for a moment, the crowd broke into laughter as they recalled the Great Swordsman Batiste who had jumped out of Wissen Town like a toad. They could not contain their laughter once they recalled the word “Anca” written on his butt.</p> <p>“Haha, it’s better to have a perkier butt!”</p> <p>“That’s right, that darned Ymir is a natural dimwit!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Because of the alcohol, some of the troops who had been bullied by the Anca family scolded without a care in the world. Under their influence, the rest of the people started cursing Ymir’s ancestors using the vilest of expletives. They almost wanted to drag the bodies of his ancestors up from their graves and give them a good flogging.</p> <p>Looking at the unfriendly barbarians around him, listening to the people exposing his master’s violent ways, the expression of the black-robed warrior changed drastically. He instinctively took a few steps back in retreat.</p> <p>“Haha, look who it is!” Just as the black-robed warrior was about to flee for his life, the thief Fenlist suddenly charged forward, kicking him onto the ground. “I’ll kill a lackey like you! D*mn it, return my finger, and cough up the money you extorted from me over the years!”</p> <p>Fenlist was furious, his eyes red. A few years ago, this man had told on him to the Anca family, as well as talked Ymir into cutting his finger off. Some time ago, it was also this man who helped Ymir extort money from him, causing his family to starve for three days.</p> <p>Hesitating for a moment, then seeing that Yang Ling wasn’t stopping Fenlist, the soldier Gullit also charged forward, kicking the black-robed warrior in the chest. When the other people saw this, they all swarmed forward under the influence of alcohol, each kicking him a few times to vent their anger. Quickly, the previously arrogant black-robed warrior had been beaten to a pulp.</p> <p>“Sir, sir, save me, save me…” After spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, the black-robed warrior crawled toward Yang Ling. He knew that he had been accumulating bad blood with the townspeople over the years and that at this moment, only Yang Ling had the ability to save him.</p> <p>“Oh, I heard that your Young Master’s skin is fair and supple, especially his butt. It is just like…” Yang Ling paused dramatically, then continued when he saw the group’s eyes on him, “It is just like a monkey’s butt, a little red peeking out from the white. I wonder if that is true or not?”</p> <p>A monkey’s butt?</p> <p>The crowd once again broke into laughter as they looked at the dirt-covered warrior in black. It felt great, it felt really great! Ymir and his lackeys had been oppressing the people of the town for years. In the past, the townspeople only dared to be angry, yet they never dared to take voice against the oppression. Now that Yang Ling was backing them, they could finally voice their grievances.</p> <p>“Sir, this… I…”</p> <p>The black-robed warrior was conflicted. If he were to follow Yang Ling’s reasoning and elaborate, how would Ymir forgive him if he ever found out about it? But if he did not comment, the furious townspeople would kick him until he became mush. He didn’t want to think about what the heavily armored barbarians around him would do.</p> <p>After a cold grunt, Yang Ling secretly shot a glance at the leader of the barbarians. The latter understood, fiercely plunging his foot down onto the right fingernail of the black-robed warrior, smashing it into pulp. In that moment, the black-robed warrior wailed pathetically, like a pig in a slaughterhouse. He shouted loudly, “Yes, yes, my master’s… His butt is like a monkey’s butt, a little red peeking out from the white…”</p> <p>“Great, really great!” Yang Ling let out a cold laugh. He looked at the crying black-robed warrior and continued, “Go back and tell those lackeys you work with, the Anca family has committed much evil. The heavens will not forgive them. If they wish to live, it is best for them to surrender as soon as possible. Otherwise, after I kill that lad Ymir during our duel, do not blame me for being merciless and exterminating them!”</p> <p>He had to go the distance!</p> <p>What was fated for him would come sooner or later. Yang Ling had decided to eliminate the problem from its roots. He wanted to completely dissolve the stronghold the Anca family had over Wissen Town. After all, one had to tackle the source when dealing with any problem. Now that the black-robed warrior was speaking ill of Ymir in front of everyone else, considering Ymir’s sinister and evil personality, he would never forgive him after he found out.</p> <p>The black-robed warrior was fearful for his life. He did not look like a fool, so he would definitely plan for his survival when faced with Ymir’s evil ways. Since that was the case, Yang Ling might be able to shake the morale of Ymir’s forces and dismantle their unity through this black-robed warrior. It would be even better if Ymir killed this warrior to vent his anger. That would definitely shake the morale of his underlings. With a few more tricks, Yang Ling could make sure that Ymir would not have a good time preparing for the duel in three days.</p> <p>The rule of not killing an envoy during a war was too outdated. Yang Ling would never speak of such hypocritical kindness. He would never let go of an opportunity to defeat his enemy.</p> <p>After spitting out a few mouthfuls of blood, the black-robed warrior fled for his life like a defeated dog. He was afraid that he would lose his life if he staid any longer. Seeing his rapidly vanishing figure, Yang Ling whispered instructions into Casey’s ear. The latter was shocked, but he quickly nodded with determination.</p> <p>After the preparations were complete, Yang Ling returned to the Terras Forest riding his Unicorn. He wanted to take the next three days to train. Since Ymir had requested a duel to the death, he must have a trump card he was relying on. At this moment, the right course of action for him to take was to quickly improve his abilities. Perhaps the half-filled bottle of Water from the Spring of Life might be able to give him a surprise.</p> <p>Yang Ling prepared for the battle without worry, but Ymir in his castle was furious and flustered. Seeing the black-robed warrior return covered in dirt, seeing him squirm and his fearful eyes, Ymir wanted badly to cut him in half.</p> <p>“You b*stard, you crawled back like a dog. You have dishonored the face of the Anca family, now scram!” In his fury, Ymir kicked the kneeling black-robed warrior. But if he had known about how the black-robed warrior had talked about his butt being like a monkey’s in front of the townspeople, the warrior would not have escaped just after a few kicks.</p> <p>Seeing Ymir’s anger and nervousness, the tactician Goode shook his head. Ymir still had a long road ahead of him if he wanted to be compared to the experienced, scheming old master. After a moment’s deliberation, he had wanted to give Ymir a word of caution. But unexpectedly, a commotion broke out from outside the castle, followed by the sounds of deafening war drums.</p> <p>“Young master, this is not good. Yang Ling’s guards are attacking us!” A flustered soldier charged into the room.</p> <p>“What? That despicable lad, he is asking for death. Come, fight together with me, quick!”</p> <p>After the shock, Ymir became furious. He gathered his guards and charged out of the castle like the wind. Unexpectedly, when they saw his figure appear, the other party issued an order and quickly retreated faster than a rabbit. When Ymir and his army returned into the castle, the other party charged forward in attack once again.</p> <p>Just like that, the group led by Casey disturbed Ymir’s army continuously. They attacked fiercely when there were not many people guarding the castle, then quickly retreated when they saw the army led by Ymir charging out, much to the fury of Ymir. Soon after, Ymir would charge out of the castle all guns blazing when he heard so much of a rustle, much like a madman.</p>",
  "Chapter 29: An Increasingly Agitated Opening": "<p>The Ladoja Valley was located at the southernmost tip of Wissen Town. It was different from the forests of green. Here, tall stones of weird shapes dotted the landscape. There were basalt ores that were hard as steel, Flower Stones that were easy to sculpt, and even large slabs of marble that were cool to the touch. This place was a natural stone quarry. Unfortunately, Wissen Town was a little out of the way, its roads winding. That made it hard to transport the stone. Otherwise, the townspeople of Wissen Town would have made a windfall by selling these stones.</p> <p>After hearing Ymir issue Yang Ling a duel to the death, Wissen Town became empty. The people of the town had been waiting at the Ladoja Valley a few hours prior to the duel. Amongst them were various troops and explorers.</p> <p>After being oppressed by the Anca family over the years, the townspeople all wanted to see Yang Ling get rid of the thorn in their flesh that was Ymir. But they felt uneasy when they saw that Yang Ling did not have any Battle Energy, nor did he release ripples of Magic Energy. After all, Ymir’s abilities were about at the level of a high level Spellcaster. With his sinister and scheming personality, and the fact that he voluntarily issued a challenge for the deathmatch, they were sure that he had an even more powerful trump card to rely on.</p> <p>The Anca family had lorded over Wissen Town for many years. It was rumored that their ancestors were bloodthirsty pirates, once snatching for themselves a large fortune and strange treasures. The people of Wissen Town had always believed in this rumor. Otherwise, how could Ymir reach the level of a high level Spellcaster despite his young age? With their wealth and connections, it was not hard for them to obtain high level magical equipment.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling had won against the Great Swordsman Batiste previously, the people of Wissen Town had not exactly seen how it happened. They all thought that it was a hidden guard that his family had sent to protect him that attacked Batiste from the shadows. Now that Ymir was not afraid, it might be hard for the hidden guard to help under the eyes of this many spectators. Thus, many of the kind townspeople were even more nervous for Yang Ling than he was for himself.</p> <p>When the time came, Ymir led a large group of warriors into the valley. He was wearing navy blue heavy armor and holding a pitch black staff adorned with a dragon’s head. He was wearing blood red boots made for battle, and he was decked in magical gear. He was covered from head to toe, and even his teeth were armored. On the other hand, Yang Ling was empty-handed, walking freely as if he was on a shopping trip.</p> <p>“Kevlar Heavy Armor, a high quality armor made by the dwarves, able to hold up against a close-range attack from a Great Swordsman; Blood Elf Battle Boots, carrying within them a wind attribute Acceleration Spell, able to increase your agility by multiple times; a Ground Guardian Cloak, carrying within it an earth element barrier that can defend the wearer against high level spells and physical attacks, a high class piece of equipment. Oh Yiblis, where did that guy obtain so many topnotch pieces of equipment?”</p> <p>Seeing the confident Ymir approaching from far away, the Knight of the Divine Palace Clause lost his voice in shock. A battle between a Spellcaster and a person would often be decided not only based on personal ability, but also based on the various pieces of magical equipment that each contestant held. Having one piece of high quality equipment would allow an apprentice to triumph over a mid level Spellcaster, much less a beginner Spellcaster.</p> <p>With Ymir’s abilities as a high level Spellcaster, coupled with all his high quality equipment, he might even be able to slay the dragon in the Terras Forest, much less win a duel.</p> <p>“Clause, look closely!” The veiled female Spellcaster Michelle shook her head, then continued, “He has a Ring of Flames on his left hand that can continuously shoot out exploding fireballs. It is a treasure, even among high quality equipment. Also, on his right hand is a Water Spirit Ring that can defend him against the mental attacks of a Magical Tutor. It can also allow him to regenerate his Magical Powers at a fast rate!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, how shameless! To equip himself with this many powerful pieces of equipment against a young man without any Battle Energy or spells. He has disgraced the entire Spellcaster community!” Clause shook his head.</p> <p>Michelle had a thought when she saw the pitch black dragon head staff in Ymir’s hands, as if she had seen it somewhere in the past. She hesitated for a moment before saying, “Clause, the dragon head staff in Ymir’s hand looks a little weird. Have you seen that somewhere before?”</p> <p>Observing it closely for a moment, Clause shook his head. There were many staffs like that in the world. Even though the Church conducted specialized lessons regarding staffs, no one could remember much about them save for some old fogeys who spent their lives researching the staffs. But since Ymir was decked out in top quality equipment, then the all-important staff should be something quite extraordinary.</p> <p>At the same time, on a hill further away, a black-robed elder hiding within a ball of black light was in shock. He looked at the dragon head staff in Ymir’s hand and mumbled, “The Snake Demon Blood Staff? Oh god, it really is the Snake Demon Blood Staff that has been lost for thousands of years!”</p> <p>“Teacher, the Snake Demon Blood Staff? That is the rumored Dark Divine Weapon, the Snake Demon Blood Staff?” A beautiful lady looked at the black-robed elder in disbelief.</p> <p>“That’s right, Maryse, that is the Divine Weapon that every Dark Spellcaster dreams of obtaining—the Snake Demon Blood Staff!” The elder let out a long sigh. Suddenly, the dark glow around his body became stronger, blocking out the merciless sunlight.</p> <p>After coming to her senses, Maryse said nonchalantly, “Haha, teacher, you have already reached the holy level. What is a mere Snake Demon Blood Staff to you? Also, as long as we are willing, that treasure is ours to take!”</p> <p>“Hmph, Maryse, I have told you before that reaching the stage of Holy Magical Tutor is just the beginning of my journey into this new world. You are merely at the level of Great Spellcaster, and you must not be reckless in your actions!” The elder slowly closed his eyes after he let out a low grunt.</p> <p>After learning that the resting place of the Holy Dragon Ayrpaciro was in the Terras Forest, the black-robed elder had brought Maryse along with him. Ayrpaciro was the divine messenger of the dragon clan that existed five thousand years ago. It once led the dragon clan and the human army in an invasion against the undeads in the Tailun Continent.</p> <p>It was rumored that after defeating the undead army, Ayrpaciro sealed the equipment of the undead, including immensely powerful Divine Weapons. Over the millennia, Dark Spellcasters and Undead Wizards who had stayed in the Tailun Continent had always searched for the place where these weapons were sealed. How could the black-robed elder pass up such an opportunity when he received this piece of information?</p> <p>The black-robed elder closed his eyes and rested while the beautiful Maryse stared at the Snake Demon Blood Staff in Ymir’s hands, secretly coming up with a plan to snatch it from him. In her eyes, against the heavily armored Ymir, Yang Ling was basically a dead man without any chance of winning.</p> <p>Outside the arena, the crowd slipped into discussions, all shocked by the rare equipment donned by Ymir. In the arena, Yang Ling smiled as he looked at the confident Ymir.</p> <p>“Haha, Sir Ymir, it’s been a long time!” Looking at the confident Ymir, Yang Ling smiled. “Why are your eyes so red and swollen? Could it be that you have been trying to catch monkeys in the mountains over the past two days?”</p> <p>Catch monkeys in the mountains?</p> <p>Ymir felt a little confused when he heard Yang Ling’s words, but the spectators broke into laughter.</p> <p>“A monkey’s butt, red peeking through the white, come look, don’t miss it!”</p> <p>“Haha, this dimwit of a person, why come and embarrass yourself, go hope and wait on your father!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Hidden in the crowd, a few troops pointed at Ymir and jeered loudly. The latter’s expression changed in fury when he heard the jeers. After understanding the situation through the words of the crowd, he became even angrier. He regretted not killing the warrior that sent the letter of challenge three days ago.</p> <p>“You… I…” Ymir pointed at Yang Ling, livid.</p> <p>“Brother Ymir, don’t be too agitated. Don’t listen to his nonsense, and do what you love to do. Let him say what he wants. After all, your butt is more important than your face!” Yang Ling laughed evilly before continuing, “How could a famous person like you not want your butt just because of a few words from the crowd? Do not let one butt affect the reputation of the entire Anca family!”</p> <p>Do not let one butt affect the reputation of the entire Anca family?</p> <p>Ymir was livid when he heard the laughter of the crowd. Over these few days, the words “Anca” and “Toad” written on the Great Swordsman Batiste had already brought him much humiliation. Now that Yang Ling was adding fuel to the fire, he was about to go mad. His blood pressure rose, nearly causing him to vomit blood and die.</p> <p>“Ah… You b*stard, I’ll kill you!”</p> <p>Ymir let out a loud roar and charged toward Yang Ling without much consideration. He had long forgotten about the lines and spells he had prepared to deal with Yang Ling. At this moment, all he wanted to do was to strangle Yang Ling to death. He wanted so badly to skin him alive and drink his blood.</p>",
  "Chapter 30: Breaking That Shell of Yours": "<p>Seeing Ymir charge at him in anger, Yang Ling understood that he had already achieved his goal. He tilted his body and moved to the side, easily avoiding the attack.</p> <p>Ever since he consumed the half bottle of Water from the Spring of Life, he had broken through the last barrier between him and the level of Spirit Wizard. It was not only his Wizard Powers that improved drastically, he was also much faster than before. Even though the Blood Elf Battle Boots Ymir was wearing doubled his agility, his speed was still lower than Yang Ling’s.</p> <p>“Oh, why is Yang Ling so fast? Ymir can’t catch up to him even though he is wearing the Blood Elf Battle Boots. It sure is incredible!” the masked Spellcaster Michelle exclaimed in shock. She then continued softly, “Could he have cast an Acceleration Spell?”</p> <p>After closing her eyes and muttering some incantations, a faint white glow silently spread from Michelle’s staff in Yang Ling’s direction. But quickly, she opened her eyes and shook her head in confusion. She could not sense any ripples of Magical Energy coming from Yang Ling’s body. Yang Ling was clearly not using any Acceleration Magic, nor was he equipped with any high level equipment that could enhance his speed.</p> <p>“Hehe, that’s right, Yang Ling’s speed is high, incredibly high, but it is not good enough. Against the heavily armored Ymir, he would suffer defeat sooner or later!” The knight Clause shook his head. In his opinion, Yang Ling stood no chance of victory against the powerful Ymir.</p> <p>“No, Clause, Yang Ling’s ability is very weird. I feel as though he has many abilities up his sleeves. No one can know who exactly will have the last laugh!” Seeing the composed Yang Ling, Michelle had a bout of inspiration. Perhaps this young man would be able to bring an even larger surprise to the table.</p> <p>After tilting his body and avoiding Ymir’s manic attack, Yang Ling let out a cold smile. He took out the sharp dagger from within his Space Ring. At the same time, he secretly conjured a ferocious Horned Bee Beast and hid it within his sleeves.</p> <p>When he was careless, even the Great Swordsman Batiste had been unable to defend himself against the poisonous stingers of the Horned Bee Beast. Yang Ling believed that a Spellcaster, and one enraged to the point of irrationality like Ymir, would fare even worse. As long as Ymir were to fall for his attack, he would become a fish ready for capture. The battle would basically be over.</p> <p>“Die!” Letting out a loud roar, Yang Ling did not retreat. Instead, he charged forward with his dagger. At the same time, he instructed the Horned Bee Beast in his sleeve to fire three nearly transparent poisonous stingers straight at Ymir’s heart. Unexpectedly, after the clear sounds of contact, Ymir’s Kevlar Heavy Armor suffered no damage. The fatal poisonous stingers were all reflected by the armor.</p> <p>What was even more unfortunate was that Ymir finally came to his senses after Yang Ling avoided the attack. He retreated as he muttered incantations, quickly raising his hand and firing a string of exploding fireballs. The fireballs exploded like grenades upon contact, leaving Yang Ling no choice but to slide sideways to avoid them.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, you blasted Summoner, die!” Ymir’s morale was high. He covered the sky with fireballs with just a spell—Sky of Fireballs. The terrifying exploding fireballs danced in the sky, all raring to burn Yang Ling into ash.</p> <p>“Oh god, Sky of Fireballs?”</p> <p>Looking at the huge exploding fireballs, the troops and explorers who knew about the spell all lost their voices in shock. Even a Great Spellcaster would not be able to cast a spell like this, much less a high level Spellcaster. The Ring of Flames sure lived up to its name as a powerful fire element equipment. Its power was spectacular.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling being pushed around, Ymir’s supporters started to cheer as they flailed the weapons in their hands. At the same time, the ordinary citizens of Wissen Town became incredibly nervous, all fiercely cursing the arrogant Ymir. Some placed their hands on their chests in prayer, hoping that the gods would bless Yang Ling, seemingly more nervous for him than he was for himself.</p> <p>“To think that the Anca family has so many more treasures other than the Snake Demon Blood Staff. Haha, I’ll have to find a chance to pull all of his equipment from his body after the battle!” Staring at the Ring of Flames on Ymir’s finger, the mature, beautiful Maryse clenched her teeth, secretly planning how to strike.</p> <p>Opening his eyes to look at the battle, the black-robed elder did not say a word. Instead, he shook his head and once again closed his eyes in meditation. He was not interested in the victor of the match between Ymir and Yang Ling. All he was concerned about was the Dark Divine Weapon Snake Demon Blood Staff in Ymir’s hand. Other than that, there was the faint trace of a Magical Energy ripple coming from the other side of the valley, causing him to keep his guard up.</p> <p>The resting place of the Holy Dragon Ayrpaciro was no small matter, and naturally there would be many people interested. According to the information from the Underground Association of Dark Magic, it was not only the Church that had sent envoys, even a few lone immortals had also come over out of interest. It looked like the temptation of Divine Weapons had attracted the attention of many.</p> <p>After narrowly avoiding the exploding fireballs, Yang Ling quickly sliced toward Ymir, his dagger aimed directly at the man’s throat. In that moment, Ymir’s supporters became very nervous, not daring to take a breath. At the same time, the uneasy townspeople began to cheer.</p> <p>At the critical moment, Ymir let out a grunt. Suddenly, the Ground Guardian Cloak he wore turned into a brown barrier. The sound of impact could be heard, but the barrier protected Ymir against Yang Ling’s precise strike.</p> <p>“Haha, where else can you run to?” After the initial shock, Ymir poured all of his Magical Energy into the Ring of Flames. He muttered incantations as he shot out a wall of fire, completely surrounding Yang Ling.</p> <p>With the protection given to him by the brown barrier, Ymir concentrated on his offense. He shot purple exploding fireballs toward Yang Ling, who was still surrounded by the wall of fire. He believed that Yang Ling would soon be either blasted to death by the exploding fireballs or turned to charcoal by the high temperatures of the wall of fire.</p> <p>After shaking the flames off his sleeves and seeing the exploding fireballs covering the sky, Yang Ling knew that he could not hide any longer. The Horned Bee Beasts had proved ineffective against Ymir’s turtle-like barrier and Kevlar Heavy Armor, but the combined attacks of his Evil Eyes might bring about a pleasant surprise. After reciting an incantation, Yang Ling summoned an Evil Eye.</p> <p>A Summoner who has a contract with an Evil Eye?</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling dodging for his life, then looking at the weak Evil Eye, the eyeballs of the people spectating the battle nearly popped out of their sockets. They hadn’t expected Yang Ling to be hiding his abilities as a Summoner, nor did they think that he had a contract with a weak creature like the Evil Eye.</p> <p>Even a small child who had just learned to walk knew that Evil Eyes were rubbish, the weakest of the weakest of the Magical Beasts. If not for the fact that they were creatures that dwelled in groups and would appear in large numbers, they would not even be classified as a Magical Beast. As long as one could carefully slice off the two tentacles it used to gather energy under its chin, the creature wouldn’t even be able to release beams of light, completely losing the battle abilities they had.</p> <p>In Wissen Town, the lullaby mothers used to coax their children went something like, “Good child, I’ll catch an Evil Eye to play with you back at home.” It was evident the status of Evil Eyes had in the hearts of the people.</p> <p>But Yang Ling had entered a contract with a Magical Beast like the Evil Eye!</p> <p>Recovering from what they just saw, the supporters of Ymir laughed loudly while the ordinary townspeople became dejected. Even a fool would not think that a useless Evil Eye could defeat a heavily armored high level Spellcaster.</p> <p>Just as the crowd was having mixed reactions, something surprising happened!</p> <p>Just as Ymir stopped his attacks and began laughing, another Evil Eye appeared behind Yang Ling. One, two… Their numbers became larger and number. In the blink of an eye, there were more than two thousand Evil Eyes in the valley. It was a tightly packed group, quickly getting into a weird, three-layered crescent formation.</p> <p>Evil Eyes that knew how to get into a formation?</p> <p>Seeing the Evil Eyes’ three-layered formation, the crowd instantly froze. The Evil Eyes’ formation was incredibly strange, the first layer sprawled on the ground like dogs, the second squatting in a strange posture, while the third stood. Casey and the barbarians, who had seen the power of the Evil Eyes, quickly retreated, while the rest of the people could not come to their senses.</p> <p>Just as Ymir’s laugh stopped abruptly, the Evil Eyes struck under Yang Ling’s command. Light beams the thickness of eggs rained onto Ymir’s brown barrier, sparks flying upon impact.</p> <p>Under the shock of the people, under the startled cries of Ymir, the brown barrier conjured by the Ground Guardian Cloak creaked before scattering into the wind. A so-called impenetrable, indestructible high quality piece of equipment became history as the crowd watched.</p>",
  "Chapter 31: Unicorn vs Evil Demon Bartho": "<p>Looking at the horde of Evil Eyes, looking at the brown protective barrier scattering into the wind, the spectators were petrified once again.</p> <p>Shocking, it was too shocking!</p> <p>Other than the restraining incantations of a Magical Tutor, a strike from a Holy Knight, or a full-powered attack from a Sword Saint, the crowd did not know who else had offensive capabilities powerful enough to instantly destroy the protective barrier formed by the Ground Guardian Cloak. But the Evil Eyes summoned by Yang Ling did it. A bunch of Magical Beasts said to be even worse than trash did it easily.</p> <p>No one would have thought that the naturally lazy Evil Eyes could launch such an organized offensive. No one could have expected that the trash-like Magical Beasts that were the Evil Eyes had such a terrifying offensive and destructive capability.</p> <p>“Tsk tsk, an Ancient Summoner?”</p> <p>Looking at the horde of Evil Eyes, the black-robed elder within the black veil of light opened his eyes wide in surprise. “Interesting. Ancient Summoners have been missing for thousands of years, but one has shown himself once again. The ancient seal has once again seen the light of day. This town is getting more and more interesting!”</p> <p>Hearing the black-robed elder say this, the beautiful Maryse looked at Yang Ling with interest. Ancient Summoners had powerful abilities. They were rumored to be able to fight against an entire armored army alone. Whether they were in a forest, a swamp, or an ocean, any place could become the fountain of their powers as long as the location had plenty of Magical Beasts.</p> <p>There was something brewing on the continent. The Dark Spellcasters were under the full prosecution of the Church. If they were able to partner up with a powerful Ancient Spellcaster and form an alliance with the family backing him, it would undoubtedly be immensely beneficial to the Underground Association of Dark Magic which was currently in a disadvantageous situation.</p> <p>“Teacher, if there is a need, please allow me to act!” Maryse quietly sought the permission of the black-robed elder beside her. Dark Spellcasters like them were most aware of how terrifying the Snake Demon Blood Staff was.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling was an Ancient Summoner, it was clear that he was still inexperienced. Otherwise, he would not have summoned a large group of rubbish Evil Eyes to do battle for him. If Ymir were to give it his all, Yang Ling would definitely die.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, the black-robed elder silently nodded. Even though Yang Ling was weak, the family behind him might be extraordinary. Every family of Ancient Summoners was basically a terrifying army of high level Magical Beasts. Saving Yang Ling would mean that the family behind him would owe them a large favor. That way, it would be easier for them to enter an alliance.</p> <p>If the Ground Guardian Cloak was unable to defend against the intense attacks of the Evil Eyes, that would mean that the Kevlar Heavy Armor, which was at the same level as the cloak, would be unable to do so either. The ferocious and concentrated attack of the Evil Eyes hadn’t killed Ymir, but he had become immensely haggard and covered with blood.</p> <p>Ymir had used his Blood Elf Battle Boots to narrowly avoid the Evil Eye’s rain of fire. Ymir clenched his teeth and bit open his index finger, allowing a drop of blood to fall on the Snake Demon Blood Staff. Suddenly, the staff released a ball of black vapor. Along with Ymir’s murmuring, the black vapor became thicker and thicker, quickly expanding into a ball of light the size of a small pond. From within it came waves of alarming howls, as if some wild beast was roaring and preparing to charge out. It was incredibly strange.</p> <p>“Hehe, that lad couldn’t hold it in any longer!” Feeling the familiar dark magic, the black-robed elder suddenly opened his eyes and stared at the weird Snake Demon Blood Staff.</p> <p>At the same time, looking at the expanding black ball of light, listening to the faint howls, the spectators turned pale. A few experienced troops sensed an unprecedented danger in the air and instinctively retreated backward. The rest followed suit when they saw the troops. Even the black-robed tactician Goode was no exception. He commanded the warriors of the family to retreat.</p> <p>“My god, what strong dark magic. Could that be a Dark Divine Weapon?” The veiled spellcaster Michelle was shocked as she sensed the terrifying dark magic gather around the staff in Ymir’s hand.</p> <p>In his shock, the Knight of the Divine Palace Clause quickly raised the spear in his hands. “Michelle, you must not act recklessly. Quick, summon the warriors and spellcasters of the Church who are nearby!”</p> <p>Facing such an unknown danger, Clause instinctively circulated the rich Battle Energy within his body. In that instant, the spear in his hand glowed red. At the same time, Michelle quickly started her incantations. Soon after, a magical six-sided star formation appeared beside her, urgently summoning the warriors and spellcasters of the Church who were nearby.</p> <p>Outside the arena, the spectators were immensely fearful. Within the arena, Yang Ling felt an unprecedented pressure. A sinister wind blew over him. His Evil Eyes howled in fear and unease. They were able to sense an unprecedented danger using just their Magical Beast instincts.</p> <p>“Hehe, you blasted Summoner. This day next year will be your death anniversary. Die!” Clenching his teeth, Ymir waved his hand. In that instant, a monster covered in flames emerged from within the black fog.</p> <p>“My god, the Evil Demon Bartho!” Maryse stared at the monster covered in flames. The Snake Demon Blood Staff sure lived up to its name as a Dark Divine Weapon. It so easily summoned a terrifying monster like the Evil Demon Bartho.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>After a roar, the Evil Demon Bartho tossed out a large swath of flames, then charged toward Yang Ling like the wind. The scorching temperature, the swaying flames, and the soaring killing intent alarmed the spectators, their scalps turning numb.</p> <p>Unable to dodge, the slow Evil Eyes suffered heavy casualties. More than a hundred of them were burned to ashes in an instant. At the same time, even though the Evil Demon Bartho was tall and muscular, its movements were even faster than Ymir in his Blood Elf Battle Boots. It evaded from side to side, easily avoiding the Evil Eye’s rain of bullets. The Evil Eyes were completely ineffective.</p> <p>Seeing the Evil Demon Bartho press forward, Ymir let out a large laugh. The warriors under him were also cheering in joy. The townspeople were nervous, not daring to breathe. Their nerves were strung taut with every step the Evil Demon Bartho took.</p> <p>After commanding the Evil Eyes to retaliate several times, but seeing them suffer heavy casualties instead of posing a threat to the Evil Demon Bartho, Yang Ling clenched his teeth and recalled them all. He summoned the fully recovered Unicorn, then quickly dodged to the side.</p> <p>Neigh…</p> <p>After avoiding the scorching flames, the Unicorn bellowed, then released a thick bolt of purple lightning. It was accurate, landing right at the center of the Evil Demon Bartho’s head. Caught off guard, the Evil Demon Bartho shuddered, its red body hair standing after being electrocuted. From far away, it looked like a giant, fiery red porcupine.</p> <p>“My god, a level eight high level Magical Beast, the Unicorn!” Seeing the pure white Unicorn, the spectators all lost their voices in shock. Even Maryse, who had prepared to go save Yang Ling, was no exception. No one would have thought that Yang Ling had a level eight Magical Beast under his control.</p> <p>“Hehe, interesting, it’s getting more and more interesting!” Looking at the Unicorn which was doing battle with the Evil Demon Bartho, then looking at the brilliant Yang Ling hiding at the side, the black-robed elder nodded in admiration.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, the Unicorn unleashed a strong offensive against the flame-covered Evil Demon Bartho. Its swift body did not stop moving, creating a shocking web of electricity. It released lightning toward the head, eyes, heart, and other vital organs of its opponent.</p> <p>Even though the Evil Demon Bartho was nimble and fast, it could not possibly keep up with the Unicorn. It couldn’t keep up, it couldn’t land a blow, and it couldn’t dodge the Unicorn’s attacks. All it could do was take the thick bolts of purple lightning head-on, unable to retaliate against the Unicorn.</p> <p>Even though it had a thick hide and muscles, the head was the Evil Demon Bartho’s only weakness, as well as the source of its power. After continuously suffering the attacks of the Unicorn, it became dizzy and staggered. The flames on its body became dimmer and dimmer. Finally, following a powerful attack of the Unicorn, it slumped over and fell onto the ground.</p> <p>“Great, this is great!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, kill him!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing the Unicorn quickly turn the tides of the battle, the townspeople cheered in elation. At the same time, Ymir’s supporters became depressed and cowered. As for Ymir, his face turned a steely green. He clenched his teeth, his gaze wavering, as if he was scared silly. But it seemed as though he was hesitating.</p>",
  "Chapter 32: An Extraordinary Trauma": "<p>“Brother Ymir, why are your clothes so torn and tattered? Look, even your butt is showing!” Seeing Ymir clenching his teeth after the exchange of attacks, Yang Ling shook his head and continued, “Exposing your fair tender butt in front of this many people, it’s alright if you don’t feel embarrassed, but please don’t catch a cold. Why not you go back and get a change of clothes before we continue our battle?”</p> <p>Fair tender butt?</p> <p>Because of Yang Ling’s kind reminder, the crowd looked toward Ymir’s butt, finally coming to their senses. Indeed, holes seemed to have been burned into Ymir’s pants by the flames. His fair butt was faintly visible.</p> <p>“Haha, not bad, it really is a little red peeking through the fair white! It looks even better than a monkey’s!”</p> <p>“Hehe, doesn’t the Anca family like to force people into prostitution? Sell him to a brothel in the Banto Empire. His business would be booming just based on his fair tender butt!”</p> <p>“Hahaha, let’s get some Orcs to pleasure him, or perhaps we could have him mate with a female Sharo Beast!”</p> <p>“No, we should have him mate with a male Sharo Beast! We can’t just ignore such a wonderful butt!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>After a round of laughter, a few troops jeered to vent their frustrations. The rest followed their lead, causing Ymir to fume and his body to shiver. If not for the fact that he knew that he could not fight off the Unicorn, he would have immediately charged toward the culprit that was Yang Ling.</p> <p>“How unfortunate, he’s made so many mistakes. How unfortunate for all the premium equipment on his body!” Seeing Ymir get defeated so miserably, the Knight of the Divine Palace Clause shook his head.</p> <p>In Clause’s eyes, with his various pieces of premium equipment, Ymir could totally have ended things the moment the battle started. With the safety of the defensive barrier of the Ground Guardian Cloak, Ymir could have unleashed a strong offensive after trapping Yang Ling with the wall of flames. This way, Yang Ling wouldn’t even have had the chance to summon his Evil Eyes, much less turn the tide of the battle.</p> <p>Also, even though the power of the Evil Eyes Yang Ling summoned was high, they were very slow. Their defensive capabilities were also very weak, as evidenced by how they were completely helpless against the Evil Demon Bartho. If Ymir was experienced enough, he could have used a continuous flow of exploding fireballs to turn the Evil Eyes into ash before they even got into their formation.</p> <p>That way, Yang Ling would have instantly become a commander without any men under him. As long as Ymir took advantage of that, Yang Ling wouldn’t even have had the chance to summon his Unicorn. Unfortunately, Ymir made many mistakes, wasting the many opportunities he had to bring Yang Ling to death’s door.</p> <p>Clause believed that if he’d had that much high level equipment himself, he would have killed Yang Ling in a few rounds. The usefulness of a Summoner was obvious in a large scale battle, but they were not adept in close combat during a one on one. The time it took them to recite an incantation and summon a Magical Beast would cause them to receive a fatal blow from an expert Swordsman or Knight.</p> <p>Outside the arena, people were gossiping and jeering loudly. Within the arena, Ymir clenched his teeth, glaring straight at the confident Yang Ling.</p> <p>Facing the sarcastic remarks of the spectators, looking at the man he hated to the core, Ymir’s expression changed drastically. He’d had a carefree life growing up, feasting on meat every day and being taken care of by his servants. He was pampered every time he left the house; who in Wissen Town would dare to be disrespectful to a young master like him? Even those rowdy troops had to show him respect.</p> <p>But this all changed when he met Yang Ling!</p> <p>Back at the elf tribe, he was about to crush the elf warriors and capture the young, beautiful elf ladies, but the blasted Summoner Yang Ling had to charge out and interfere. He even commanded his Horned Bee Beast to take a chunk out of Ymir’s butt, causing him to be bedridden for a full month.</p> <p>He wasn’t even lying on the bed for a month; he was sprawled on the bed, facing downward! Recalling that jail-like experience, Ymir so wanted to grind Yang Ling’s bones into dust.</p> <p>After he contacted the assassin’s guild, he had wanted to drink himself into a stupor when he received the bad news that the assassination was unsuccessful. He fought back his anger for a few days and thought that he could finally kill Yang Ling through the hands of the royal Great Swordsman Batiste, whom the tactician Goode had contacted from the Banto Empire. But who would have known that his plan would backfire, giving Yang Ling the opportunity to write the word “Anca” on Batiste’s butt and humiliate him?</p> <p>He was ashamed to the point of fury. He felt unjustly treated. He hated Yang Ling to the core!</p> <p>Over these days, Ymir had deeply tasted these new, terrible feelings. Ever since he suffered heavy casualties at the elf tribe, he felt as though everything had changed.</p> <p>His father had written a letter and given him a good tongue lashing. The tactician Goode would frequently sigh when he saw him. Even his servants and lackeys who had always been obedient were talking behind his back.</p> <p>Some rumors called him unskilled and said that he could not do anything right without his father’s help. Other rumors claimed that Yang Ling was conducting a large-scale recruitment of soldiers, ready to invade Ymir’s castle. Rumors filled every corner of his home. Every time Ymir heard of these rumors, he felt his blood boil. He so wanted to pull the tongue out of the person who started spreading these rumors.</p> <p>He’d had enough!</p> <p>If he were to tolerate this any longer, Ymir suspected that he would become a lunatic, a lunatic who would bite anyone he came across.</p> <p>“Brother Ymir, are you alright? Could you really be as unfortunate as to prove me right, catching a cold just because your butt’s exposed!” Seeing Ymir furious and shivering, Yang Ling smiled. He had vented his frustrations.</p> <p>It feels good, it feels so good!</p> <p>When one was in love someone, wouldn’t that person do whatever was described in a love song and try any method to win their love? Similarly, when one hated someone, they must assault that person physically and mentally. They must kick him even after he fell and make him unable to stand up ever again.</p> <p>Seeing Ymir, his expression changing due to the jeering of the spectators, Yang Ling felt greater than he would have if he had stabbed Ymir in the chest.</p> <p>“Hehe, this lad is getting more and more interesting!” Hearing the crowd’s brazen jeers, seeing the furious Ymir, then seeing the hidden dagger in Yang Ling’s smile, the black-robed elder nodded approvingly.</p> <p>“Interesting?” Looking at the handsome Yang Ling, Maryse had a thought. “It is rare that you would think so highly of someone, but we would have to test him to see if he is truly useful or not!”</p> <p>“Maryse, he might be part of a powerful ancient family; pay attention to your limits, do not act recklessly!” The black-robed elder shook his head. He knew the type of person that Maryse was.</p> <p>It would have been fine if the black-robed elder did not speak, but now that he had said this, Maryse grew more interested in Yang Ling. Winning over a man that even her teacher admired was definitely more exciting than winning over a noble that had both wealth and status. She was very confident in her charms. There was no man who had avoided becoming smitten with her, not in the past, not in the present, and definitely not in the future.</p> <p>After giving some instructions, the black-robed elder slowly closed his eyes, cautiously observing the faint ripples of magic energy from the other side of the mountain. It was alright for a powerful fighter to not act, but if he did, he must do so with the force of a lion, killing with one blow. It paid to be careful.</p> <p>Outside the arena, the crowd was still discussing and jeering loudly. In the arena, Ymir was about to make a difficult decision. Looking at Yang Ling and his mocking smile, hearing the crowd’s increasingly offensive jeers, he felt as though he was becoming insane.</p> <p>Should I go all out against him?</p> <p>After a moment’s hesitation, Ymir clenched his teeth and slit his wrist. He allowed the red blood to shower onto the strange Snake Demon Blood Staff. In that instant, the weird staff started releasing a giant wave of magic energy.</p>",
  "Chapter 33: Ymir’s Insanity": "<p>“Hahaha, d*mn you Summoner, I’ll give you a fate worse than death!” Ymir looked insane, laughing maniacally as he allowed his blood to rain onto the weird Snake Demon Blood Staff.</p> <p>After devouring a large amount of fresh blood, the Magical Energy released by the Snake Demon Blood Staff became more and more terrifying. Soon, a pitch black ball of vapor had gathered around them. There were thunderous roars coming from within from time to time, even more frightening than when Ymir summoned the Evil Demon Bartho.</p> <p>“Oh god, why has the sky turned dark, what’s going on?” Looking at the weird Snake Demon Blood Staff in Ymir’s hands in shock, a soldier noticed that the sky was becoming darker and darker. Gray clouds seemed to have laced the sky, as if night had already descended upon them.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, it’s so cold!” After a sudden gust of cold wind, the troops hunched against the chill and said in terror, “The weather has changed! To think that b*stard Ymir could change the weather! Could it be that he is prepared to summon that hairy demon from the depths of hell?”</p> <p>“No, listen to those terrifying roars. It might not be just that hairy demon. He might have summoned the God of Evil!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Witnessing the terrifying change in the weather, the spectators lost their voices in shock, instinctively taking steps backward. Ymir had managed to summon the terrifying demon Bartho just by using a few drops of blood. Now that he was maniacally pouring his blood onto the staff and creating such a terrifying change in the weather, who knew what horrifying monster he was going to summon this time.</p> <p>The spectators lost color in their faces. The Knight of the Divine Palace Clause and veiled Spellcaster Michelle were no exception. Clause was in full defensive mode, the spear in his hands releasing a three-inch thick ray of red light after he infused it full of his Battle Energy; Michelle clenched her staff tightly, once again urgently summoning the warriors and spellcasters of the Church.</p> <p>After the magical formation shimmered a few times, five strong warriors and an elderly spellcaster appeared beside Michelle. After a few formalities, they all stared straight at the black ball of gas that was releasing a large amount of dark magic, their expressions serious.</p> <p>“Brother Ymir, it might not be too appropriate for you to be dancing with your butt exposed in front of everyone?” Seeing Ymir flailing his arms and chanting loudly, Yang Ling shook his head and said, “You can admit defeat if you really cannot beat me, I’ll spare you. There’s no need for you to dance butt naked in front of everyone to ask for mercy!”</p> <p>Dance butt naked in front of everyone?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, the crowd once again erupted into laughter. As for the chanting Ymir, he shuddered in fury and spat out a mouthful of blood. He nearly died before completing his spell.</p> <p>Despite his sarcastic words, Yang Ling wasn’t careless as he watched the dark ball of fog grow increasingly larger. He leapt onto the Unicorn and summoned a few Horned Bee Beasts. Ymir was fully concentrating on reciting his incantations. This was the best time to launch a sneak attack. Yang Ling would be a true fool if he were to miss such a good opportunity.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, a few Horned Bee Beasts charged forward, straight toward Ymir. But unexpectedly, just as Yang Ling was about to succeed, Ymir let out a shout. Following that, a terrifying monster charged out from within the black ball of fog.</p> <p>The monster was covered in black scales, and it was nearly a hundred meters long. It was thicker than a bulldozer, roaring loudly as it charged out. At first glance, it looked like an oversized Amazon Giant Python. But what made it even scarier were the nine ferocious looking heads that rose from its thick neck. Nine of its red tongues flicked in and out continuously, making the skin on everyone’s scalp begin to crawl.</p> <p>“My god, a level nine Magical Beast, the Nine-headed Snake Demon!”</p> <p>Looking at such a terrifying monster, the experienced troops staggered backward. The rest of the crowd saw this and started to flee in fear, afraid that the monstrous Nine-headed Snake Demon would devour them alive if they were too slow. Chaos ensued in that instant. Many people were crying for their daddies and mommies.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, a Great Swordsman who had practiced his Battle Energy for many years would only have abilities equal to a level six Magical Beast. Against a level nine Magical Beast, even a beginner or intermediate Sword Saint might not be able to deal with it easily, much less a Great Swordsman.</p> <p>It was rumored that five hundred years ago, the famous Sword Saint Savage and Magical Tutor Barzark arranged to meet and hunt the level nine Magical Beast Flame Phoenix deep within the Terras Forest together. In the ensuing battle, one died and one was injured. Barzark, who had been lucky enough to escape using his teleportation magic, died a few days later from his injuries. It was clear how terrifying a level nine Magical Beast was.</p> <p>A level nine Magical Beast?</p> <p>The crowd was fearful. Maryse, who was hiding further away, was also shocked. She hadn’t expected Ymir to be able to summon such a terrifying dark element Magical Beast. It looked like the Snake Demon Blood Staff was extraordinary indeed. Ymir had been able to summon the Nine-headed Snake Demon by forcefully tearing open a dimensional crack using his blood essence and an incomplete incantation.</p> <p>“Teacher, it looks like you’ll have to personally save that kid!” Overcoming her shock, Maryse shook her head. She had just reached the level of Great Spellcaster. Even if she had the best of equipment, she would not be able to win against a level nine Magical Beast.</p> <p>Observing the Nine-headed Snake Demon with his sharp gaze, the black-robed elder let out a sigh of relief. “This is merely a Nine-headed Snake Monster at the later stages of level eight. It has not fully evolved into a Nine-headed Snake Demon. But even so, Yang Ling is definitely no match for it. Maryse, escape quickly, and I will attack when you are gone. I’ll meet you back at the temporary outpost.”</p> <p>Compared to the Nine-headed Snake Monster at the later stages of level eight, the black-robed elder was more worried about the faint ripples of Magical Energy on the other side of the valley. He had unleashed several detection spells, but they had all been rendered ineffective. That meant that the other party’s abilities were the equal of his own. The lair of the Holy Dragon Ayrpaciro was an important place. It was expected that a few thousand-year-old freaks would also gather here. He had to be on guard at all times, in case he encountered an ambush.</p> <p>After coiling its body, the Nine-headed Snake Monster did not care about the few Horned Bee Beasts beside it. The first head from the right released a breath of frost, instantly freezing two Horned Bee Beasts into ice; the second head spewed a ball of flames, burning three Horned Bee Beasts into ash; the third pounced forward, instantly devouring the remaining two beasts.</p> <p>“Hahaha, you blasted Summoner, let’s see where you can escape to now!”</p> <p>Seeing the Nine-headed Snake Monster easily dealing with the Horned Bee Beasts he hated to the core, Ymir let out loud, manic laughs, his body shaking. In order to get his revenge, he had ignored the restrictions of the family and forcefully used the Snake Demon Blood Staff. He had not only lost a large amount of blood and vital life force, he might even have reduced his lifespan by ten years.</p> <p>Even though the tactician Goode had tried to stop him, Ymir had stubbornly gone forward with his plan. In order to finish Yang Ling, in order to humiliate the blasted Summoner, he was willing to pay any price. If he had to tolerate him any longer, Ymir might have gone insane.</p> <p>Under Ymir’s command, the Nine-headed Snake Monster unleashed a ferocious attack on Yang Ling. It sometimes shot out sharp ice spikes, sometimes spewed a column of flames, sometimes pounced forward and bit down speedily. Yang Ling was lucky that the Unicorn was insanely fast, allowing him to narrowly avoid the dangers time and time again.</p> <p>Even though they were both level eight Magical Beasts, the Unicorn was obviously weaker in Magical Energy, offensive capabilities, and defensive capabilities. In the blink of an eye, there were a few jagged wounds on the body of the Unicorn. Yang Ling was not in any better shape either, his legs numb from the cold, his eyebrows almost singed off.</p> <p>With its speed, the Unicorn dodged as it retaliated with thick bolts of purple lightning. After suffering from the attacks, the Nine-headed Snake Monster also became numb. It did not dare charge forward too recklessly after the Unicorn’s attacks. But with the Unicorn’s injuries becoming heavier and heavier, it could not retaliate any further. It also gradually became slower, while the ferocious Nine-headed Snake Monster became increasingly fiercer.</p> <p>The situation was getting worse for Yang Ling!</p> <p>“Sister Sofia, what are we going to do?” Looking at Yang Ling in such a dangerous situation, Alice’s eyes became red with worry.</p> <p>“Alice, it’s alright, Yang Ling will be fine!” Sofia consoled herself softly. She was also worried, her vision blurred from her tears.</p> <p>As a forest elf with a long history, Sofia had heard many stories about the Nine-headed Snake Monster when she was young, and she naturally understood how terrifying it was. In her worry, all she could do was nervously pray to the Goddess of Nature.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, that darned lad, how did he summon such a monster?”</p> <p>“Sigh, is a fine lad like that going to…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Both Sofia and Alice were worried. The crowd who had scattered in all directions also shook their heads. Some were cursing at the sinister Ymir, and some were nervously shutting their mouths, afraid that they would offend Ymir and feel the wrath of his revenge. There were even some silently praying, hoping that Yang Ling would be granted the protection of the gods.</p> <p>No one thought that Yang Ling would be lucky enough to escape with his life when faced against such the terrifying Nine-headed Snake Monster!</p> <p>But just as Ymir was laughing crazily, just as the crowd was certain that Yang Ling would die, something unexpected happened once again!</p>",
  "Chapter 34: A Crowd Beating": "<p>After avoiding a cluster of ice spikes on the Unicorn, Yang Ling realized that dodging like this was no longer an option. He clenched his teeth and decided to risk it all. He formed a hand gesture and summoned fifteen Withered Tree Warriors.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, the Withered Tree Warriors who had giant clubs in their hands pounced toward the Nine-headed Snake Monster with heavy steps, each step jetting up plumes of dust. They surrounded the Nine-headed Snake Monster and clobbered it, the ground shaking with every strike.</p> <p>Caught off guard, the Nine-headed Snake Monster became completely surrounded by the fifteen Withered Tree Warriors. The first to receive a beating were the nine heads that could use magic spells. They were beaten silly by the Withered Tree Warriors. Following that, the Nine-headed Snake Monster felt a sharp pain traveling up its spine. It had been assaulted by the wandering Unicorn.</p> <p>A Giant Summoner?</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling summon a full fifteen ten-meter tall giants, the crowd slipped into shock once again. They had thought that Yang Ling would have certainly died, but no one could have expected the tides of the battle to turn once again. Now it was Ymir’s turn to shiver in fear.</p> <p>“Clobber it to death, clobber it to death!”</p> <p>“D*mn it, bash in its snakehead, step on its body!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling turn the tables, Casey and the rest were elated. The troops that had retreated far away also shouted in excitement. Being able to witness someone kill a level nine Magical Beast was already a lucky sight. Other than the powerful black-robed elder who had seen many things, an average person wouldn’t even be able to tell the difference between the Nine-headed Snake Monster and the Nine-headed Snake Demon.</p> <p>The Ring of Flames, Ground Guardian Cloak, a large number of Evil Eyes that could get into a formation, the Evil Demon Bartho that was covered in flames, the fabled level nine Magical Beast, giants that were ten meters tall… The crowd was excited. They have never seen such an exciting duel. It was hard to tell who would have the last laugh.</p> <p>Seeing the group of Withered Tree Warriors appear out of thin air, seeing Yang Ling close in on him, Ymir’s mind went blank. He had exhausted a large amount of blood essence and ten years of his life to forcefully summon the Nine-headed Snake Monster, expecting to humiliate the blasted Summoner Yang Ling, then personally slice his throat open. But to think that he was a Giant Summoner.</p> <p>Must he use his final trump card?</p> <p>Seeing the Withered Tree Warriors surrounding the Nine-headed Snake Monster and giving it a beating, Ymir hesitated. The Snake Demon Blood Staff was a secret treasure passed down by his ancestors. It was rumored that his ancestors had pillaged a seaside tribe and excavated the tribe’s treasure from under their sacrificial altar.</p> <p>After receiving the Snake Demon Blood Staff, the ancestors had left behind a fragmented, incomplete incantation and a lesson, highlighting the fact that forcefully using the Snake Demon Blood Staff would exhaust a large amount of blood essence and might even bring about an unpredictable disaster. One should not use it unless there was no other option.</p> <p>“Tsk tsk, Brother Ymir, I sure couldn’t tell that you have so much blood within you. To be so energetic despite having bled so much. It must be because you grew up drinking blood. Hehe, how powerful; you sure live up to your name as the b*stard spawn of the Anca family!”</p> <p>Yang Ling gave a cold laugh when he saw the depressed Ymir. He raised the sharp dagger in his hand and prepared to humiliate him once more before slicing his throat open. But if he knew what Ymir was hesitating about, Yang Ling would have struck immediately. He would not have taken the time for such leisurely chatter.</p> <p>“Hahaha, great, great, great! Yang Ling, one of our lives will end here today!” Agitated by Yang Ling, the rash Ymir pushed aside the lessons of his ancestors in his fury.</p> <p>Inflicting three cuts on his wrist, Ymir placed his wound directly on the strange Snake Demon Blood Staff, then started chanting loudly. Ymir quickly turned pale, as if the Snake Demon Blood Staff had absorbed all the blood essence in his body; His muscles shriveled, his eyebrows and hair turning from black to white. His head became bald after a sinister wind blew.</p> <p>A mummy?</p> <p>Seeing Ymir wither instantly, Yang Ling felt his scalp turn numb. Every hair on his body stood on end. He instinctively thought about the mummies he had once seen on the television; the empty eye sockets, the withered skin…</p> <p>Yang Ling was incredibly shocked, but the surrounding crowd even more so. They did not know what Ymir was trying, and they were worried that Ymir would summon a more horrifying monster. It was rumored that the Anca family were the incarnations of devils. It sure looked true at this moment.</p> <p>Ymir looked neither like a human nor a ghost. With his final shout, a soaring black fog erupted from the Snake Demon Blood Staff. At the same time, the Nine-headed Snake Monster that was getting clobbered shuddered. After a roar, its body seemed to expand, a black light pulsing through its scales. A metallic clank could be heard when the Withered Tree Warriors bashed its body, as if they had come into contact with a sturdy metal.</p> <p>After absorbing the black fog released by the Snake Demon Blood Staff, the power of the Nine-headed Snake Monster increased. With a strike, it managed to repel several Withered Tree Warriors. It moved its nine heads in unison, and in that instant, a purple flame covered the sky.</p> <p>Purple Heavenly Fire?</p> <p>Sensing the pulsing ripples of Magical Energy, the black-robed elder became shocked. He rapidly opened his eyes. He did not expect the cultivation level of the Nine-headed Snake Monster to increase this drastically after absorbing the black fog released by the Snake Demon Blood Staff. It was now only one step away from evolving to become a level nine Magical Beast that was the Nine-headed Snake Demon. It looked like the Snake Demon Blood Staff was powerful indeed, living up to its reputation as a dark element Divine Weapon.</p> <p>The Withered Tree Warriors were tall and powerful and had immense strength. But unfortunately, the Purple Heavenly Fire was their nemesis, and their bodies blistered under the flames in the blink of an eye. Seeing this, Yang Ling did not worry about killing the mummy-like Ymir. Instead, he clenched his teeth and summoned all of his Evil Eyes.</p> <p>“Hahaha, burn, burn, burn. Burn all of these people into charcoal!” Seeing the Nine-headed Snake Monster display its godlike power, Ymir laughed insanely, still holding the eerie Snake Demon Blood Staff. Under his command, the Nine-headed Snake Monster glared at the Withered Tree Warriors, completely oblivious to the horde of Evil Eyes behind it, ready to attack.</p> <p>“D*mn it, I do not believe that I cannot put a hole in your scales!”</p> <p>Commanding the Evil Eyes to quickly get into formation, Yang Ling gave the order to attack. At that moment, thousands of Evil Eyes fired at the same time. The pellets of light rained down on the Nine-headed Snake Monster that was caught off guard.</p> <p>There was no unstoppable spear or unbreakable shield in this world.</p> <p>The scales of the Nine-headed Snake Monster were hardy, able to withstand even blows from the mighty Withered Tree Warriors. But the Evil Eyes did it. The so-called trash of the Magical Beasts, under Yang Ling’s command, once again shocked the crowd. They saw the true meaning of strength in numbers.</p> <p>An Evil Eye alone was nothing to be scared of. Its slow attacks, lazy nature, and snail-like speed were all enough for it to be defeated in one strike by its enemies. But when their numbers amounted to more than two thousand, and they were able to release a continuous net of firepower, their destructive capabilities were rather alarming. Quickly, the Nine-headed Snake Monster’s scales had been blasted full of holes, its flesh ripped open in many areas, revealing its pale white bones.</p> <p>Under the intense pain, the Nine-headed Snake Monster released its beast-like instincts, moving its nine heads at once and covering the sky with flames. It charged toward Yang Ling. With the Unicorn’s speed, Yang Ling managed to avoid being hit time and time again, but the slow Evil Eyes suffered heavy casualties. Some were burnt and rolling on the ground; others were turned to ash, incinerated in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>Seeing the ravaging Nine-headed Snake Monster, Yang Ling had an idea. He recalled the story of Sun Wukong and the iron fan, and he decided to risk it all. He clenched his teeth and summoned over two thousand Horned Bee Beasts, then commanded them to dig into the exposed wounds of the Nine-headed Snake Monster and tear apart its internal organs.</p> <p>Hiss…</p> <p>Suffering from this attack, the Nine-headed Snake Monster rolled on the ground, trying its best to twist its body, hoping to shake off the terrifying Horned Bee Beasts. But it was to no avail. Quickly, it felt the sensation of thousands of ants devouring its body. It shuddered in pain and let out pathetic cries.</p> <p>Seeing the Nine-headed Snake Monster tired from putting up a fight, the Unicorn and various Withered Tree Guardians who had spiritual qualities joined in the fight without Yang Ling having to command them. This was especially so for the few Withered Tree Warriors that had been burned. They seemed to be furious, hitting the struggling Nine-headed Snake Monster especially hard. After they snapped their giant clubs, they picked up large rocks and slammed them down on the monster repeatedly.</p> <p>Under the combined attacks of the Evil Eyes, Horned Bee Beasts, Withered Tree Warriors, and the Unicorn, the Nine-headed Snake Monster quickly became covered in blood and wounds. Fresh blood and brain matter flowed out of the snake, and even its intestines spilled out. Its howls became softer and softer, its struggles increasingly less powerful.</p> <p>After freeing himself from the threat of the Nine-headed Snake Monster, Yang Ling rode on his Unicorn and charged toward the dumbfounded Ymir, fast as lightning. This time, he did not waste his breath on any nonsense. The staff in Ymir’s hands was too strange, and who knew what terrifying monster he could summon next if he was given time.</p> <p>Yang Ling had fast reactions, but the mummified Ymir only snapped out of his shock after the Nine-headed Snake Monster became motionless. It was too late. Without giving him time to turn and run, Yang Ling’s sharp dagger had already pierced into his Ymir’s heart, killing him with one strike!</p> <p>“You…”</p> <p>Ymir looked in disbelief at the dagger, his eyes bulging. He would not rest in peace. Even when he let out his last breath, he could not believe that the plan he had put together for such a long time wasn’t able to grant him revenge. Instead, he was going to die by Yang Ling’s hand.</p>",
  "Chapter 35: We’re Getting Drunk Tonight": "<p>After rapidly dealing with Ymir, Yang Ling casually picked up the strange staff and tossed it into his Space Ring. Even though the staff looked incredibly eerie, it was obvious that it was a rare treasure. At the same time, he did not miss the loot on Ymir’s body, such as the Blood Elf Battle Boots and the Ring of Flames.</p> <p>Looking at the massive corpse of the Nine-headed Snake Monster, Yang Ling clenched his teeth and absorbed the entire body into the Space Ring. A monster this terrifyingly large would most likely give him many valuable Blood Orbs. He might gain more from this single beast than if he were to hunt in the Terras Forest for months.</p> <p>“D*mn it, burn this devil!”</p> <p>“Drag his corpse and parade through the streets!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The crowd only came to their senses after Yang Ling stored the massive body of the Nine-headed Snake Demon. Some of them suggested burning the zombie-like Ymir. Some were still indignant about the grievances they suffered under the Anca family and wanted to drag his corpse along the streets.</p> <p>Seeing the agitated townspeople, then thinking about the magnificent castle of the Anca family, Yang Ling had a thought. He decided not to stop with defeating Ymir. He might as well eliminate the problem from its source. He said loudly, “Brave warriors, I’ve taken down Ymir, but his lackeys are still occupying the castle. What shall we do?”</p> <p>“Invade their castle and kill all their lackeys!”</p> <p>“Charge in and use their heads as a sacrifice to appease the vengeful souls of the dead!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s provocation, the people’s pent-up hatred for the Anca family erupted like a volcano. They were in high spirits. Ymir was dead, and with the powerful Yang Ling backing them up, the people wanted to bathe the Anca family castle in blood immediately.</p> <p>“Hehe, smart! He knows how to incite public fury at such a young age!” Seeing Yang Ling wishing to eradicate the problem at its source, the black-robed elder once again nodded his head in admiration.</p> <p>“Hmph, d*mn it, to think that he kept all of the spoils of war. He did not leave anything behind!” Maryse could not get over the high level magical equipment on Ymir’s body, especially the Snake Demon Blood Staff hailed by Dark Spellcasters as a Divine Weapon.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, the black-robed elder said slowly, “Maryse, he has many Magical Beasts and his background is unknown. You must not act recklessly, remember that! Perhaps it is not a bad thing that the Snake Demon Blood Staff is in his hands!”</p> <p>After that chilling battle, the Snake Demon Blood Staff must have caught the attention of the Church. Given how many important eyes were undoubtedly watching these events, the black-robed elder did not want to invite trouble. After all, compared to the large numbers of Undead Divine Weapons sealed by the Holy Dragon Ayrpaciro, the Snake Demon Blood Staff was secondary.</p> <p>“Yes, your disciple understands!” Seeing how seriously the black-robed elder took this matter, Maryse lied. She was secretly thinking about how she could get her hands on the legendary Snake Demon Blood Staff. If she could obtain that item, she believed that she could immediately advance to the level of a high level Great Spellcaster from a beginner Great Spellcaster. She might even achieve a breakthrough to become a beginner Magical Tutor.</p> <p>As the black-robed elder’s disciple, coupled with the power of her family, Maryse had gotten everything she set her eyes on since she was young. She believed that even if she did not attack, she could definitely get Yang Ling to obediently hand her the Snake Demon Blood Staff. Before her charms, no man had been able to resist falling head over heels for her. Even the young Yang Ling would be no exception.</p> <p>Maryse was secretly coming up with a plan. Yang Ling, on the other hand, was quickly strategizing the best way to invade the Anca family castle with the least amount of effort. After the necessary preparations, he led the large army and charged for the castle.</p> <p>Surround the castle and strike at the heart!</p> <p>The Anca family castle was surrounded by mountains and rivers. It was easy to defend and hard to invade. It was the most magnificent castle within a few thousand kilometers. Yang Ling understood that there would be heavy casualties if he attacked the castle head on. Hence, he came up with the idea of surrounding the castle.</p> <p>Ymir had already fallen in battle, so the warriors in the castle were without a leader. This, coupled with Yang Ling’s numbers advantage and high morale, meant that the warriors in the castle would not be willing to battle. Their morale would be low. Yang Ling believed that by surrounding the castle from three directions and engaging in a ferocious offensive, a large number of their warriors would flee in fear from the last castle gate. They might even surrender without putting up a fight.</p> <p>The Anca family castle was originally called Wissen Castle, and its land was about the size of a dozen golf courses. The walls of the castle were built using black, sturdy basalt, and the ground was tiled with marble. It was magnificent and opulent, and everyone within a few thousand kilometers knew about the castle. This was also how the town came to be named Wissen Town.</p> <p>It was rumored that the Wissen Tower was an ancient castle left behind from long ago. Some said that this was one of the traveling palaces used by a king in the past. There were many carvings of troops and horses in random corners of the castle. Others said that this used to be the vacation home of a wealthy man whose assets could rival kingdoms. The servants would sometimes uncover exquisite art pieces.</p> <p>There were also some who claimed that this was a gathering place for many Dark Spellcasters or Undead Wizards. Many people had heard the wails of dead spirits in the middle of the night or spotted ghostly figures floating within the gardens. No one knew who built this opulent castle, nor did they know how many years of history this castle had.</p> <p>Instructing the crowd to barricade the north, east, and south gates heavily, Yang Ling intentionally left the west gate unguarded. He then instructed Casey to lift Ymir’s head and attack the east gate.</p> <p>Indeed, when they saw the numbers that Yang Ling brought with him, as well as Ymir’s severed head, the warriors in the castle lost the will to fight. Some walked out with hands in the air to surrender, while others fled hurriedly through the west gate, hoping that they could avoid disaster by escaping into the Terras Forest.</p> <p>The warriors who fled did not know that even though the west gate seemed to be a pathway to survival, it was actually the place they would die. Yang Ling had already set a trap there. In the face of the mountain barbarians, the expert archers of the forest elves, and Yang Ling’s Magical Beast army, the warriors did not have any means of retaliating.</p> <p>A complete victory!</p> <p>In just half a day, Yang Ling had successfully taken down Wissen Castle and captured nearly all of Ymir’s lackeys. Amongst them was the black-robed tactician Goode, who had hoped to escape by disguising himself as a servant.</p> <p>After controlling the situation, Yang Ling gathered all of the townspeople and began publicly judging the criminal activities of the Anca family’s lackeys. The females were sent to the noose while the males were sent to the guillotine. Other than the tactician Goode who was imprisoned in a secret location, the rest of the evil lackeys were executed, much to the joy of the townspeople.</p> <p>Seeing their former tormentors getting executed, the crowd cheered, and some even wept in joy. Over the years, many of the townspeople had their families broken apart by the bloodsucking Anca family. Many of the people even had to witness the deaths of their family members!</p> <p>That night, waves of excited townspeople flooded the streets, making their way to the Evening Primrose Bar where Yang Ling resided. They all presented Yang Ling with gifts of their own.</p> <p>Merchants gave him crates of crystal coins, hunters gifted him precious Essence Crystals of Magical Beasts… In fact, there was even a poor lady who baked a whole plate of pastries for Yang Ling. To her, pastries with a thin layer of meat filling were the most delicious thing in the world.</p> <p>In the eyes of the townspeople, Yang Ling was not only a benefactor who had taken revenge for them, he was also the man they would rely on for their livelihoods in the future. As long as he was in Wissen Town, the townspeople didn’t need to worry about the Anca family seeking revenge. They didn’t need to worry about a bully like Ymir emerging in Wissen Town again.</p> <p>Seeing the sincere merchants and the simple townspeople, looking at the elderly and ladies weeping in joy, Yang Ling did not say anything more. He instructed his servants to hand a cup of delicious rum to everyone present and announced that all of the alcohol that day would be on a fifty percent discount.</p> <p>It was a party, an all-out party!</p> <p>Under the influence of cheap, good alcohol, the crowd partied through the night, bustling the entire Wissen Town. Yang Ling’s name spread throughout every corner of the small town like a warm breeze at the end of spring.</p>",
  "Chapter 36: Gains": "<p>After the victory, Casey led the warriors and found the hidden treasury of the Anca family, obtaining many spoils of war. Not only were there many crystal coins, there were also various rare art pieces and antiques, amongst which were works of the famous painter Laiska. It was assumed that those treasures came from the Anca family robbing a certain noble.</p> <p>Laiska had been the most famous painter from the Banto Empire two thousand years ago. In many small towns, nobles there might not know how many sons the king had, but they would definitely know of the art piece that propelled Laiska to fame, the portrait of Pope Aynrosen the Tenth.</p> <p>In the painting, Pope Aynrosen the Tenth was sitting on an opulent high chair, his body leaning to the left. His lips were shut, his brows locked tight together. His sullen face carried a thick, eagle-like nose. His stern appearance was laced with a shred of ferociousness. One could respect him, but not become friendly with him. One could honor him, but not get on close terms with him. The exquisite painting displayed the Pope’s authority, and it was praised highly by Pope Aynrosen the Tenth himself.</p> <p>Ever since it was finished, Laiska’s painting had been regarded as the best portrait to have ever been produced. Be it nobles or artists, all of them had the highest of admiration for the painting. They all claimed it as a miracle and a model for all artists to follow. Thus, an endless number of nobles started asking Laiska to do portraits for them.</p> <p>Those who did not know of Laiska were not fit to be nobles!</p> <p>That was one of the ways nobles compared with one another. Whoever could get Laiska to do a portrait of them would have the right to boast in front of the others.</p> <p>Casey and the rest found many of Laiska’s famous works in a purple sandalwood crate. There were portraits of the wives of nobles, portraits of kings, and even a few paintings of popes, all incredibly lifelike.</p> <p>It was a full crate!</p> <p>With this many precious works of art, the prices would definitely be exorbitant if they were to auction them. After the explanation of the old butler Murbaqi, Yang Ling understood the value of these portraits.</p> <p>“Murbaqi, do you have a way to quickly cash in on these antiques and pieces of calligraphy?” Yang Ling was not particularly interested in the so-called famous portraits. He would rather have a few crates of crystal coins.</p> <p>The old butler was a little surprised when he heard Yang Ling say this. He had been a butler for Harribell’s family for many years. He had only heard of nobles trying their hardest to collect these valuable paintings. He had never seen someone who did not care at all for them. After a daze, he reacted, “Sir, we can get Boulade Merchant’s Association to auction the paintings, but it might take some time. In order to advertise it, we will probably need at least two months!”</p> <p>“No problem, I’ll give you free rein on that. Also, tidy up the castle as soon as possible; we relocate here in two days!” After giving a few instructions, Yang Ling turned to leave.</p> <p>After all these times of observation, Yang Ling understood that the old butler was an assistant he could not have too many of. No matter how troublesome the situation was, it would become orderly in the hands of the butler. Also, the butler was experienced, knowing what he had to say and do. Whenever Alice would give him a massage in thin clothing, the dwarf Rumi would often shout in shock while the butler would pretend that he did not see anything.</p> <p>Professionalism!</p> <p>Seeing the capable Murbaqi, Yang Ling could not help but recall his female superior they called a superwoman. She was calm and logical, and she possessed years of experience!</p> <p>The Anca family castle was called Wissen Castle. It was sturdy and magnificent, easy to defend and difficult to invade. There were many secrets within the castle, while the outside was surrounded by mountains and rivers. It was much better than being cooped up in the dwarf’s weapon shop. Yang Ling would not let go of the opportunity to live in such a magnificent mansion.</p> <p>Even though Wissen Tower had many eerie legends, Yang Ling did not pay much heed to them. Rumors spread quickly in this world, each version becoming more ridiculous than the last.</p> <p>There might have been nothing going on, but incapable people tended to worry incessantly!</p> <p>In Yang Ling’s eyes, those rumors were mostly baseless. If he had the time to contemplate such flimsy legends, he might as well use that time to cultivate his Wizard Mantra or tame a few Magical Beasts in the Terras Forest.</p> <p>After the battle with Ymir, Yang Ling felt that he was not powerful enough. If Ymir had not lost his rationality in his fury, or if Ymir had more battle experience, Yang Ling might have been reduced to ashes. Thinking back to the terrifying Nine-headed Snake Monster, Yang Ling could still feel his scalp crawl.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts were incredibly fast and even able to shoot out poisonous stingers after they have evolved, but as low level Magical Beasts, they were helpless against higher level beings like the Evil Demon Bartho. The Evil Eyes had immense power when attacking together, but their movements were slow and their defensive capabilities were a mess. The Withered Tree Warriors had powerful offensive capabilities, but their movements were also too slow. If they were pitted against a speed type Magical Beast, they would not be able to keep up. The Unicorn was quite good, adept in offense and defense. It was also incredibly speedy, but Yang Ling only had one.</p> <p>Did he have to take the risk and enter deeper into the Terras Forest to tame higher level Magical Beasts?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head. He had tamed the Unicorn through utter coincidence. He would not be that lucky every day. After entering the deeper regions of the forest, even Harribell and her team suffered heavy casualties. Yang Ling was not willing to be torn to shreds by hordes of high level Magical Beasts.</p> <p>Thinking about high level Magical Beasts, Yang Ling had an idea. He remembered the corpse of the Nine-headed Snake Monster he had absorbed into his Space Ring. If a low level Twin-headed Deer could yield him two Blood Orbs, Yang Ling did not dare imagine how many Magical Beast Blood Essences a terrifying creature like the Nine-headed Snake Monster would give him.</p> <p>Even though he had received another two small bottles of Water from the Spring of Life from the elf elder, Yang Ling was not willing to consume it all. After all, the forest elves could only obtain a few drops of the Water from the Spring of Life from an ancient tree every year. The water was a precious and scarce resource.</p> <p>But Magical Beast Blood Essences were different. The Terras Forest spanned tens of thousands of miles. No one really knew how many Magical Beasts there were within. Even though the Blood Essence of low level Magical Beasts wasn’t as good as the Water from the Spring of life in terms of enhancing Wizard Powers, it won in terms of availability.</p> <p>In order to prevent sneak attacks from enemies while he was extracting the Magical Beast Blood Essences, Yang Ling instructed Argus to lead a team of barbarians to heavily guard the door.</p> <p>Through the warriors and servants of the Anca family who surrendered to him, Yang Ling had learned that Ymir’s father had gone away leading a group of elite warriors. That allowed Yang Ling to gain the advantage and easily topple the heavily defended Wissen Castle. Yang Ling had destroyed the Anca patriarch’s lineage and leveled his stronghold. How would he forgive Yang Ling?</p> <p>It was said that a barking dog would not bite, while a dog that would bite would not bark. The enemy in the darkness was always the most terrifying! Yang Ling did not wish to be stabbed in the back while he was concentrating on obtaining the Blood Orbs.</p> <p>Releasing the corpse of the Nine-headed Snake Monster, Yang Ling looked at its massive body and stroked its hard, pitch-black scales. He then looked at the nine heads that could release different spells at the same time. Yang Ling felt fortunate. Thinking back to the fight, if he had hesitated for even a moment, he would have died horribly.</p> <p>The lantern-sized eyes of the Nine-headed Snake Monster were bulging. It looked like, even in death, it couldn’t believe that it had fallen to a human who knew neither Battle Energy nor magical spells. It certainly wasn’t resting in peace!</p> <p>Without any more delays, Yang Ling sat cross-legged and took a deep breath. He placed his right hand on the Nine-headed Snake Monster and circulated the Wizard Power within his body. Quickly, streaks of red blood vapors were released from the body of the Nine-headed Snake Monster, gathering in his palm.</p>",
  "Chapter 37: Spirit Wizard": "<p>Streaks of red blood vapor quickly emerged from within the body of the Nine-headed Snake Monster and crystallized to form a red orb on Yang Ling’s palm. From far away, it looked like Yang Ling’s hand was a machine that could absorb smoke, drawing the blood from within the body of the Nine-headed Snake Monster.</p> <p>Condense, condense it further!</p> <p>Yang Ling had emptied his mind and was trying his best to circulate the Wizard Power in his body. The smaller the volume of the blood orb, the more Blood Essence of the Magical Beast was condensed inside, making it more valuable. In normal circumstances, the higher the level of the Magical Beast, the more energy its Blood Essence would contain. Since the Nine-headed Snake Monster was a high level Magical Beast, Yang Ling was excited to see how different its Blood Essence was.</p> <p>Back when he commanded his army of Magical Beasts to injure the Nine-headed Snake Monster severely, Yang Ling had wanted to tame it with his blood. But taming a dying Unicorn had already exhausted all of his Wizard Power and Blood Essence, so he did not dare imagine how much Wizard Power and Blood Essence he would need to successfully tame the Nine-headed Snake Monster, given that the Nine-headed Snake Monster was more powerful than the Unicorn. After some deliberation, he had decided to give up on that notion, just in case that he might lose his life if he was too careless.</p> <p>Following the removal of the Blood Essence from its body, the corpse of the Nine-headed Snake Monster started to shrink. In the end, all that was left was a sheet of thin skin draped over its skeleton, as if all of the moisture in its body had been sucked out.</p> <p>Some time later, Yang Ling sensed that he could no longer absorb any more blood. He slowly opened his eyes, only to see that there was a large pile of red Blood Orbs beside him.</p> <p>Severing the heads of the Nine-headed Snake Monster with his sharp dagger, Yang Ling extracted nine Essence Crystals of varying colors from within. The Wizard Mantra had mentioned that cultivating it to the highest level would allow him to absorb the energy of all matter. Currently, Yang Ling was unable to absorb the energy within the Essence Crystals directly, but that didn’t mean that he would still be unable to do it in the future. Keeping the Essence Crystals with him might prove useful in the future.</p> <p>After a brief count, Yang Ling realized that he had about five hundred Blood Orbs. What he gained here was worth much more than what he got when he was in the Terras Forest for a month. Under normal circumstances, an ordinary Magical Beast could only create one Blood Orb, but the Nine-headed Snake Monster had produced five hundred. It sure lived up to its name as a high level Magical Beast. There was a massive amount of energy within its body.</p> <p>Grabbing and observing a handful of red Blood Orbs, Yang Ling did not hesitate to consume them. He was now at the later stages of the Blood Wizard, merely a step away from advancing to the stage of Spirit Wizard. With this many Blood Orbs, he might be able to achieve a breakthrough.</p> <p>Yang Ling had just swallowed the Blood Orbs when he felt a wave of heat spread through his body. Wherever the wave of heat passed, the muscles, bones, and nerves in his body became fortified. The Wizard Power circulating within his body also ballooned, and the speed with which it circulated became faster and faster.</p> <p>Elatedly, Yang Ling instinctually continued consuming the Blood Orbs. One by one, slowly but surely, the Wizard Power within his body became increasingly massive. If his Wizard Powers were a small stream at the start, then they had become a raging current, circulating within his body through a mysterious track.</p> <p>Wherever the expansive Wizard Power passed, Yang Ling felt a fiery pain, as if he had been burned. It was as if every bone in his body was broken, mended, then broken again in a cycle. Slowly, the pain gradually turned to numbness, and his consciousness became more and more hazy.</p> <p>Some time later, Yang Ling slowly opened his eyes. Concentrating, he noticed that a large portion of the Blood Orbs beside him had disappeared, leaving him with a little more than two hundred orbs. At the same time, there was a massive amount of Wizard Power within his body, raging without rest. It was completely different from the Wizard Power he had before. There was a thick layer of black stains on his body.</p> <p>Destruction and regeneration?</p> <p>Thinking back to the pain that sunk right into his bones, Yang Ling had a thought. He sent his consciousness into the mysterious space where the Wizard’s Pagoda was.</p> <p>Within the space that housed the Wizard’s Pagoda, a large group of Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes were devouring the mist released by the Wizard’s Pagoda. Withered Tree Warriors all turned into giant trees, manically absorbing the mysterious fog that was releasing a pale green glow. Wherever the green light passed, the bodies of the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes expanded slowly, as if the green glow brought them immense benefits.</p> <p>Quickly, Yang Ling noticed that his two thousand and some Horned Bee Beasts had all evolved to the second level, gaining the ability of the poison stingers. As for the hundred Horned Bee Beasts that had evolved to the second level after consuming the Water from the Spring of Life, they had all evolved to the third level, growing another pair of wings. Not only had their speed been doubled, they could also now fly without leaving behind traces or sounds, easily catching their enemies off guard.</p> <p>Furthermore, the injured Evil Eyes were not only fully healed, they had also evolved to the second level. They could now release a bolt of blinding light once every day, temporarily robbing the sight of their enemies. Yang Ling believed that making use of this new ability that the Evil Eyes had gained would make his army of Magical Beasts even more powerful.</p> <p>After walking around the Wizard’s Pagoda, Yang Ling realized that the green sprouts on the bodies of the Withered Tree Warriors had grown to become leaves. He understood that the warriors had also evolved, their abilities becoming more powerful. Regrettably, the most powerful creature in his arsenal, the Unicorn, did not show any obvious transformation. It might have been because it needed more energy to undergo an evolution. After all, compared to low level Magical Beasts like the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes, the battle capabilities of the Unicorn were many times more powerful.</p> <p>Even though it was a little regrettable, Yang Ling was still incredibly excited. Just based on the evolution of the Horned Bee Beasts, Evil Eyes, and Withered Tree Warriors, his abilities were now much more powerful than they had been. Also, he believed that with the improvements to his Wizard Power, the Unicorn would also one day undergo an evolution. As long as he had enough Water from the Spring of Life and Blood Orbs from Magical Beasts, he believed that day would not be far off.</p> <p>After taking in a few breaths of the fog, Yang Ling felt refreshed. The Wizard Power in his body quickly started to circulate. Through the explanation on the stele, Yang Ling understood that the fog released by the Wizard’s Pagoda was useful for boosting the evolution of the Magical Beasts. The deeper his Wizard Powers, the thicker the fog, and the denser the energy it contained.</p> <p>After circling the space that housed the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda, Yang Ling did not stay any longer. With a thought, his consciousness slowly exited the space. Standing up and testing his movements, Yang Ling was surprised to realize that his body felt as light as a feather. He could now leave a deep imprint of his fist on the sturdy basalt wall with just a punch. At this point, he could finally confirm that he would successfully advance to the level of Spirit Wizard after he absorbed all of the energy in the Blood Orbs.</p> <p>Absorb the blessings of heaven and earth, grab the essences of the sun and moon!</p> <p>There were two large differences when he advanced into the level of Spirit Wizard. The first was that he could now set up a spell to rapidly absorb the spiritual energy in his surroundings, accelerating the speed of his cultivation. The second was that he could now attack by using incantations.</p> <p>Blood Wizards, other than their ability to tame Magical Beasts with blood and crystallize Blood Essences, had no means of direct attacks. But after cultivating to the level of Spirit Wizard, this problem had been solved. According to what was written on the stele, high level Incantation Techniques could not only attack the physical body of an opponent, they could also directly hit the mind and soul of the other party. The ability was incredibly powerful.</p> <p>Chaos Incantation Technique?</p> <p>Thinking back on the various weird Incantation Techniques on the stele, Yang Ling could not help himself. He was raring to give them a try. He took large steps outside and was prepared to instruct the old butler Murbaqi to gather various materials for him. Unexpectedly, he had just stepped out of the secret chamber when he saw a group of people pacing anxiously outside the door.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, are you okay? There were no signs of you for a good half a month, and we were all so anxious!” Sofia pounced forward without care when she saw Yang Ling’s figure, her eyes red.</p> <p>It’s been half a month?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head. He had not expected half a month to have passed while he was unconscious. There writing on the stele said that cultivating the Wizard Mantra at the later stages would require sessions of half a month, sometimes even a few years. He had not believed that before, but it looked like those claims were true.</p> <p>“Haha, my beautiful lady, you’re missing me so much even though we haven’t seen each other in just half a month?”</p> <p>“Miss you, my foot!” Sofia blushed, shy. Seeing that no one was noticing her, she extended her hand and pinched Yang Ling’s back before walking hurriedly to the side.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, I would have run out of wine to drink if you had come out any later!”</p> <p>After charging forward with large steps, the dwarf Rumi had wanted to pat Yang Ling on the shoulder. But he was too short, even though he was tiptoeing. All he could do was pound Yang Ling’s chest. Unexpectedly, a thump could be heard, as if the dwarf had struck a hard slab of stone. Yang Ling was nonchalant, but the dwarf’s hand had become red and swollen.</p> <p>“You drunkard, are you looking for death!” Seeing Rumi grimace in pain, Yang Ling laughed. After advancing into the level of Spirit WIzard, his body seemed to have improved in all aspects. Furthermore, he had intentionally circulated his Wizard Power at his chest just now. It would be weird if the touchy dwarf had not been injured.</p> <p>Seeing Rumi fall silent and gasp in pain, Sofia broke out into laughter. “Yang Ling, if you had come out any later, Rumi would have finished the last bottle of the Raphael Red Wine, that drunkard!”</p> <p>“All I did was take a small sip. I’m not working for you for free! Hey Sofia, when did you become so petty?” Rumi denied loudly. He blinked, then said, “You forget about your friend now that you have a lover. I’m so pitiful!”</p> <p>After saying this, Rumi ran away. Sofia was an expert in Natural Magic, and Rumi did not want to find himself hung from a bunch of branches. Rumi did not notice that Yang Ling had silently summoned a Withered Tree Warrior. Rumi did not come across any branches, but ran head first into the leg of the Withered Tree Warrior. He fell flat on his back, groaning continuously.</p>",
  "Chapter 38: Spirit Gathering Spell Formation": "<p>The next night, the townspeople saw a large notice placed outside the Evening Primrose Bar. The bar was purchasing the Blood Essences of Magical Beasts for a high price, over a hundred Black Crystal Coins per bottle. The higher the level of the Magical Beast, the more they would pay, with no upper limit! Other than that, the bar was also buying Essence Crystals of Magical Beasts and various other crystals at a good price!</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, I have heard of people buying the Essence Crystals of Magical Beasts, but I have never seen someone who would buy the Blood Essences of Magical Beasts. What is going on?” A bearded hunter shook his head as he read the notice, unable to understand why anyone would want those particular crystals.</p> <p>After staring at the bearded hunter, a hunter carrying a bow and arrow said, “Why do you care what Sir Yang wants the Blood Essences of Magical Beasts for? As long as he says he wants them, then we shall gather them for him in the forest. What’s more, he is offering such a high price!”</p> <p>“That’s right. We could buy enough food for the winter if we sell him a few bottles of Blood Essence!”</p> <p>“You’re right. We have to hurry home and make preparations. Even if we are unable to capture Magical Beasts, the reward for picking up a few Dark Fire Crystals in the forest is not too bad either!”</p> <p>“Haha, wouldn’t it be better if we captured a Magical Beast and harvested a bottle of blood from it to sell every day?” Seeing the excited hunters, an unemployed lad was also raring to go.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Slowly, the number of townspeople gathering to look at the notice increased. In the end, even a few troops and adventurers crowded over to see what was causing the commotion. Even though they did not understand the rationale behind Yang Ling’s actions, the townspeople were still rather happy. Winter was upon them. If they didn’t earn more money to purchase provisions, it would be hard for them to get through the cold months.</p> <p>“Sir, a hundred Black Crystal Coins for a bottle, isn’t that price a little high?”</p> <p>Murbaqi stood on the second level of the Evening Primrose Bar, watching the excited townspeople going home in preparation to hunt Magical Beasts. He had a worried look on his face. He did not understand why Yang Ling wanted to purchase such a large amount of Magical Beast Blood Essence. In his eyes, the useless Magical Beast Blood Essence was not even worth one crystal coin, much less a hundred Black Crystal Coins.</p> <p>Taking a sip of the rich Raphael Red Wine, Yang Ling smiled. “It’s not expensive, not expensive at all. It’s better to have more, be it the Essence Crystals or Blood Essence of Magical Beasts, or even the various other crystals!”</p> <p>Ever since he moved into Wissen Castle, Yang Ling had decided to go all out. He intended to set up a giant Spirit Gathering Spell Formation within the inner areas of the castle in order to accelerate the speed of his cultivation. Under normal circumstances, various high grade crystals were the most optimal materials needed for the spell formation. But since he could not gather them in such a short span of time, he had to use the Essence Crystals of various Magical Beasts as replacements.</p> <p>In addition to the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation, Yang Ling also wanted to create various Wizard Amulets. Until he advanced to the level of Earth Wizard, Wizard Amulets would be the best offensive and defensive weapons in his arsenal. After repeated experimentation, Yang Ling found that the Blood Essences of Magical Beasts were the optimal items for drawing amulets. The higher the level of the Magical Beast, the more powerful the Wizard Amulet.</p> <p>Time was money, and efficiency was of utmost importance!</p> <p>After finding the riches that the Anca family had accumulated over the years, Yang Ling no longer saw money as a problem. The most important thing to him now was rapidly improving his abilities in order to deal with any revenge attempts by the survivors of the Anca family. On this continent where the strong survived, the best course of action was to improve his abilities. Of course, he could also sell the Wizard Amulets after he succeeded in making them. He was guaranteed profits.</p> <p>“Murbaqi, inform me if there is any good news!” After giving some instructions, Yang Ling left with large steps. He wanted to think about the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation and the Wizard Amulets.</p> <p>Wissen Castle occupied a wide area. Yang Ling intended to first set up a Spirit Gathering Spell Formation in his living quarters before expanding it to cover the entire castle when he gathered enough ingredients. He believed that at that point, even Sofia and Casey’s training would yield doubled results, much less his own.</p> <p>Money could get people to do anything. That night, there were many people who brought the items he wanted in exchange for coins. Some troops even worked together and used spells to freeze the corpses of the Magical Beasts to avoid wasting even a drop of blood. Of course, these were all low level Magical Beasts. Without enough confidence, no one would dare hunt in the deeper parts of Terras Forest.</p> <p>Also, the townspeople had spread the news far and wide, even getting their friends and relatives to search for Dark Flame Crystals and various other crystals. Even though the quality was not very high, they could still be used.</p> <p>That night, the old butler Murbaqi spent close to five hundred Purple Crystal Coins just to purchase the Blood Essence of Magical Beasts. He felt the pinch. But Yang Ling did not mind that. A few hundred crystal coins were nothing compared to the Anca family’s alarming amount of riches.</p> <p>The townspeople were elated after successfully obtaining the crystal coins. They had not expected to really be able to sell the Magical Beast Blood Essences. Troops and adventurers who were not on missions for the time being banded together to hunt. After they collected their crystal coins, they either went to the dwarf weapons shop to get weapons fitted for them or drank at the Evening Primrose Bar. In the end, the crystal coins still ended up in Yang Ling’s hands.</p> <p>After three days of preparation, Yang Ling decided to set up a small scale Big Dipper Spirit Gathering Spell Formation in his yard. Yang Ling sorted out the various Essence Crystals of the Magical Beasts and buried them in the respective positions of the Big Dipper. In order to enhance the effect, he even buried all of the Essence Crystals he obtained from the Nine-headed Snake Monster.</p> <p>According to the stele, the Big Dipper Formation was the most commonly used Spirit Gathering Formation, its size varying. If the formation was large, it would need upward of 400 million high grade crystals. A smaller one usually only required a few hundred crystals.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling knew that Essence Crystals of Magical Beasts could to some extent take the place of crystals, he was not sure how effective they would be. Thus, he decided to bury all eight hundred of the Magical Beast Essence Crystals he had. He buried one of the Essence Crystals of the Nine-headed Snake Monster in each of the seven spell points required in the Big Dipper.</p> <p>Compared to a low level Magical Beast like the Twin-headed Deer, the Essence Crystal of the Nine-headed Snake Monster harbored a massive amount of energy. Yang Ling believed that even if the effects of the spell formation were less than desirable after he set it up, he would still be able to match the speed of cultivation he had when he was in the Terras Forest. This would save him the time of traveling to the Terras Forest every time he wanted to train.</p> <p>After setting up the spell formation, Yang Ling checked it several times. It paid to be cautious. Who knew what accidents might occur if he made a mistake. He did not want to be like the chemist Nobel, injuring himself every time he conducted experiments with explosives. Sitting cross-legged under the moonlight, Yang Ling took in a deep breath as he infused all of the Wizard Power in his body into the spell points of the Big Dipper Formation. Without the activation of Wizard Power, the Big Dipper Spirit Gathering Formation was merely an empty shell.</p> <p>Even though he knew that there were people spying on him from far away, Yang Ling did not really mind. On this continent, only he possessed this unique Wizard Power. If someone else tried to forcefully activate the spell formation using Magical Energy or Battle Energy, they would only face the terrifying devouring force of the Spirit Gathering Formation. Even a Magical Tutor would not be able to avoid it.</p> <p>Yang Ling had just infused his Wizard Power when the Big Dipper Spirit Gathering Formation let out a light hum. The spell formation then radiated a circle of rainbow-colored light, manically absorbing the spirit energy in the surroundings. The trees in the yard swayed despite there being no wind.</p> <p>Calm your senses and empty your mind!</p> <p>After successfully activating the spell formation, Yang Ling was elated when he felt the thick spirit energy in the surroundings. He immediately started his training, devouring the spirit energy, which seemed to have become tangible. In the fog, it felt as though the sky full of stars was releasing bolts of pure, ice cold energy.</p> <p>“Teacher, what is going on? Is this another way of using the Snake Demon Blood Staff?” Standing on a faraway hill, Maryse looked at the black-robed elder beside her, confused.</p> <p>“No, this is not the Dark Energy released by the Snake Demon Blood Staff!” Opening his eyes, the black-robed elder shook his head and said slowly, “Powerful. Even my detection spell is unable to penetrate it. Maryse, that young man is not simple. You must not act recklessly!”</p> <p>Hearing her teacher say this, Maryse’s interest in Yang Ling grew. She had never seen her teacher admire a young man this much. He had only said that it was decent that she was able to go from an apprentice to a Great Spellcaster in a mere ten years. She did not understand where Yang Ling came from to have such a mysterious ability.</p> <p>At the same time, on a giant stone in the northwest area of Wissen Town, a white-haired elder slowly opened his eyes. He looked in Yang Ling’s direction in disbelief. The Knight of the Divine Palace Clause and veiled Spellcaster Michelle were standing respectfully behind him, silent. Around the giant stone were a group of ferocious, heavily armored warriors and spellcasters in white robes.</p>",
  "Chapter 39: Tactician": "<p>After silently training for a night, Yang Ling felt that his Wizard Power had improved by leaps and bounds, his body brimming with energy. He could clearly see the Terras Yellow-tailed Bird perched on a branch far away through the fog. After a breeze blew past, he could clearly hear the gossip of two ladies picking wild vegetables on a hill.</p> <p>“Giana, I heard that you are going to get engaged with Argus in two days?” A lady wearing a rough blue skirt asked her friend after slicing off a bunch of green maize.</p> <p>“Yes, Argus and I are getting engaged the day after tomorrow.” Giana smiled sweetly, blushing under her fair skin. She rubbed her aching sides and said in excitement, “In just two more months, Argus will be able to clear the debt he accumulated to treat his mother’s illness. He might also purchase the house he mortgaged, if he can get an advance of half a year of pay from the butler. We would be able to get officially married then!”</p> <p>Seeing Giana’s sweet smile, the lady in the rough skirt was rather jealous. She sighed. “Giana, I really envy your Argus for being able to work for Sir Yang and earn a good sum of money every month. He sure is different from the bum I have back home, only knowing how to waste his life!”</p> <p>Giana swept her hair back, then said, “This is all possible due to Sir Yang’s benevolence. Otherwise, Argus would have died back in the forest. My mother has said that Sir Yang is the great benefactor of our household. I must get him to come celebrate with us on the day of our engagement!”</p> <p>“Yes, Sir Yang is truly a good person. He is so powerful and handsome, the woman who married him would definitely be happy!” Talking about Yang Ling, the lady in the short skirt became more energetic.</p> <p>“That’s right, what woman in town is not jealous of Alice? To be able to stay with Sir Yang all day long, how blissful!”</p> <p>“Giana, if you were given a choice, would you choose Argus or Sir Yang?”</p> <p>“D*mn you, all you think about is nonsense like that!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Placing their scythes in their baskets, the two young ladies started chasing each other and playing on the hill. In the end, they even bet to see which of them could kiss Yang Ling on the cheek first. Yang Ling shook his head when he heard this.</p> <p>Am I a good person?</p> <p>When he was little, others would hand over the five cents they picked up on the floor to the teacher while he would first think about using the five cents to buy himself a popsicle. When he was in college, the professor would often tell students to help each other, while he would always be thinking about how he could get his classmates to buy more telephone cards from him. He had never thought of himself as a good person.</p> <p>He only humiliated the Anca family after defeating the Great Swordsman Batiste because he realized that Ymir would never forgive him after losing to him in the battle at the elf tribe. Thus, he thought he might as well meet Ymir’s challenge, and he unknowingly helped the townspeople vent their frustrations in the process. After that, he had taken the opportunity to get rid of Ymir and keep the Anca family from continuing to bother him, but his methods seemed to make the people happy.</p> <p>Yang Ling knew that he was not a good person, and he would not restrict his actions because of this title given to him. The term “repay kindness with kindness” was nonsense to him. In this world, there was only eternal profit, not eternal friends.</p> <p>Thinking about this, Yang Ling suddenly remembered the tactician Goode that he had locked away in a secret place. According to the thief Fenlist, many of the schemes of the Anca family originated from this low profile person. Even though he did not care about his reputation, it was better to use someone hidden in the darkness to take care of some things that should not be exposed to the general public. Clearly, this Goode was a decent candidate.</p> <p>Wissen Castle was large. In addition to the buildings on the surface, there was also an underground palace. The jails within that palace had an area of two standard sized football fields. Ymir’s tactician, Goode, was locked away deep within the underground jail.</p> <p>In order to prevent the criminal from escaping or someone from infiltrating the jail, Yang Ling had sent his most elite barbarians to guard the underground prison. These barbarians would only listen to his orders and nobody else’s, not even the leader of the guards Casey.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s instructions, the leader of the barbarians, Jarlock, personally led the way. They made their way past many oil lamps, stepping on the cold basalt ground to an eerie underground cell.</p> <p>The surroundings were covered in darkness, the air dank. One could even hear the sound of a mosquito flying past them. It was terrifyingly silent. An average person might break down if they were kept here, only able to look at the orange light from the oil lamp and the pitch black walls.</p> <p>“Get up, get up, don’t pretend to be dead!” Seeing the black-robed Goode curled motionlessly in the corner, Jarlock shook the thick steel bars of the jail cell.</p> <p>Hearing the sudden sounds of the shaking door, Goode looked up in confusion. His face was haggard, his eyes dull. He looked like he did not have any strength in him, as if he had suffered greatly over these past days.</p> <p>“Water, I want to drink water, water…” Rubbing his eyes and confirming that this wasn’t a dream, Goode pounced forward, a little crazed. His lips were cracked and dry. It looked like he had not had any food for a few days now. After all, barbarians were barbarians. Being polite to prisoners wasn’t high on their priority list.</p> <p>When Jarlock looked at him, Yang Ling nodded his head. Jarlock understood and took out his water bottle, handing it through the steel bars. Ever since they had increased their number of blacksmiths and smithies, Yang Ling had ordered the dwarf Rumi to upgrade the gear of all the guards. Even though they were still unable to fit them with personalized armor and weapons, the guards at the very least had their own simple water bottles.</p> <p>Gulp, gulp…</p> <p>Finishing the sweet, cold spring water from the bottle, Goode exhaled deeply. He looked skeptically at Yang Ling, who was standing beside the barbarian Jarlock. His eyes darted sideways from time to time, seemingly more energetic than before.</p> <p>“Jarlock, guard the door of this underground cell. No one is to enter without my orders!” Yang Ling sent the barbarian Jarlock out of the cell. There were things that were better known by the fewest people possible.</p> <p>Silence, dead silence!</p> <p>After the barbarian Jarlock made his way out, Goode silently looked at Yang Ling, his intentions unknown. Yang Ling also did not make a sound as he watched Goode fight to remain calm. Even though the other party was suppressing it, Yang Ling could still see streaks of unease in his eyes.</p> <p>“You are Yang Ling?” After hesitating for a long while, Goode could no longer hold it in any longer and asked an obvious question.</p> <p>“That’s right, I am the Yang Ling who killed Ymir and leveled the Anca family. I am the blasted Summoner that you tried time and time again to kill.” Seeing the other party speak first, Yang Ling let out a cold laugh.</p> <p>“Haha, what a joke! Leveled the Anca family?” Goode wiped the water from his chin and said coldly, “Ymir’s father took away a large portion of our elite warriors and spellcasters. You killed his only child. You won’t have a happy ending!”</p> <p>Seeing Goode quickly collect himself, his thoughts clear and words sharp, Yang Ling was secretly impressed. He knew that he had found the right person. Yang Ling had only been able to survive till this day because of Ymir’s rash behavior. If Ymir was flexible enough to listen to the tactician Goode’s advice, tolerating it until his father returned with the elite troops and spellcasters, Yang Ling might have fled in fear.</p> <p>“I do not know how my life will end, but as for yours…” Yang Ling went straight to the point, poking Goode’s weak spot.</p> <p>Indeed, hearing Yang Ling say this, Goode’s expression changed. He had not expected Yang Ling to turn defeat into victory and triumph over the terrifying Nine-headed Snake Monster. He also hadn’t expected Yang Ling to act this fast, leading the people and attacking Wissen Castle that the Anca family had occupied for almost a century. He had not had the time to escape.</p>",
  "Chapter 40: Tempting Rewards": "<p>Seeing Goode’s expression change almost to a grimace, Yang Ling confirmed that he had hit his weak point. The plan to recruit Goode was already fifty percent successful.</p> <p>In order to recruit a person with Goode’s abilities, Yang Ling had to take the initiative and attack his morale. To attack his morale, Yang Ling had to target his weaknesses! As long as he could toss out a sufficiently tempting reward at the opportune moment, the carrot and stick technique would definitely motivate Goode to jump on board.</p> <p>“Hmph, you’re right. I have indeed overestimated the power of the Snake Demon Blood Staff, or should I say that I underestimated your abilities!” Goode stared icily at Yang Ling after letting out a cold grunt, as if already coming to terms with his death.</p> <p>“Haha, you lost the game because of one wrong move! Unfortunate, how unfortunate!” Looking at the desolate Goode, Yang Ling understood that he had resigned himself to fate and lost the will to survive. He feigned pity and shook his head. “Ymir committed many evils and deserved to die. But the crimes of the rest of his people do not necessarily warrant death. Are you so willing to die with him?”</p> <p>My crimes do not warrant death?</p> <p>Looking at the smiling Yang Ling, Goode secretly deliberated the man’s motive for coming here. Ever since he made a mistake and got himself captured, he knew that his end would not be pretty given his identity. After finding no opportunities to escape this prison, he had resigned to himself to his fate. Now that he was hearing Yang Ling’s words, he could see a faint ray of hope.</p> <p>Looking at the joyful Goode, seemingly thinking about something, Yang Ling took out a thin piece of paper from his robes. He slowly read, “Goode Adamina, originally Steve Masterton, an Earl by heritage, commander of army war preparations. Led a group of troops in rebellion eighteen years ago, resulting in the extermination of his family. His whereabouts are unknown…”</p> <p>“Who… Who exactly are you, and how do you know all of that?”</p> <p>Goode’s face lost its color in his shock. He had changed his name and identity after escaping from the capital eighteen years ago. No one knew of his true identity other than a few trusted men that fought through life and death with him. To think that a Summoner of unknown background like Yang Ling could speak of his past… Just who was he, and what was his motive?</p> <p>Could it be that he was one of the legendary Shadow Guards, personally commanded by the emperor?</p> <p>It was rumored that in order to listen in on the actions of his ministers, every emperor of the Banto Empire had under him a personal group of guards. They had higher authority than a minister, able to act first before reporting their actions to the emperor. They were unbelievably stealthy, and they were nicknamed the Shadow Guards.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, just who… Just who are you, and what is your motive?” Looking at the unfathomable Yang Ling, Goode struggled to swallow his saliva. If Yang Ling was truly one of the legendary Shadow Guards tasked to assassinate him, he might suffer a fate worse than death now that he had landed in the man’s hands!</p> <p>After giving a mysterious smile, Yang Ling said, “I am merely a small merchant hoping to open a few shops here to feed my family and live a peaceful life!”</p> <p>Seeing Goode shocked beyond words, Yang Ling understood that he was one step closer to succeeding. In order to obtain this information, Yang Ling had given the name of the top class tactician of the Anca family to Murbaqi and asked him to hand it over to Harribell the moment he captured Goode. He had hoped for Harribell to help him search for Goode’s background. Harribell had quickly given him a reply, living up to her reputation of a powerful family with immense riches.</p> <p>A small merchant that hopes to open a few shops and feed his family? Goode swallowed hard, his brows creasing. He secretly deliberated Yang Ling’s identity and motive.</p> <p>Yang Ling had been able to open a dwarf weapon shop and a wine refinery, then gather a large group of followers. If that classified him as a small merchant, then the other merchants in the town might as well be beggars! Coupled with the terrifying army of Magical Beasts under his command, one need not think too hard to dismiss Yang Ling as a small merchant, especially since there were rumors of him being a famous Summoner.</p> <p>“How unfortunate, a respectable Earl of the empire by heritage, a respectable commander of the army war preparations, would fall to become a tactician for the leader of a gang of pirates!” Yang Ling shook his head and continued, “I am very curious; just what benefits did the Anca family give you for you to ignore your suffering family and stay here like some cowardly tortoise!”</p> <p>According to the information, after Goode led a group of trusted guards and fled the capital eighteen years ago, the members of his family were either executed or sent to the gaols. Some were even exiled to barren lands or directly banished to become wretched citizens, their lives worse than death. Yang Ling could not understand it. How could Goode, the best tactician of the Anca family, once a noble of high status, tolerate all of this?</p> <p>Cowardly tortoise?</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s provocation, the pain Goode had suppressed all these years instantly erupted. He shook the steel bars of the cell fiercely and shouted, “Just who are you? Speak! What do you want?!”</p> <p>Looking at Goode’s red eyes, Yang Ling said calmly, “It is not important who I am. What is important is that I can help you. I can save your pitiful family!”</p> <p>“Hahaha, save my family? With what, your identity as a Shadow Guard?”</p> <p>It was as if Goode had just heard the biggest joke in the world. Other than being a Shadow Guard, he could not understand how Yang Ling would have such remarkable abilities and riches. Other than being a Shadow Guard who was omnipresent, he did not understand how Yang Ling would know so much about his background. Goode could not think of anyone who would be so interested in him, other than one of the emperor’s heartless killers.</p> <p>Shadow Guard?</p> <p>Looking at the frantic Goode, Yang Ling creased his brows. He knew that Goode had mistaken his identity. “Goode, frankly speaking, I am an Ancient Summoner, and also a Tree Shepherd. I have never heard of a Shadow Guard. My motive for talking to you today is simple; I want you to work under me!”</p> <p>Seeing Goode’s misunderstanding grow deeper, Yang Ling decided to speak more directly. In order to be more persuasive, he summoned the Withered Tree Warriors, Horned Bee Beasts, and Evil Eyes out in one go.</p> <p>Ancient Summoner, Tree Shepherd?</p> <p>Looking at the horde of Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts, then looking at the Withered Tree Warriors, their heads touching the top of the cell even though they were squatting, Goode was dumbfounded. In his memories, Ancient Summoners and Tree Shepherds were merely legends in the historical annals. He had never heard of any Shadow Guard with such unique abilities.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, forcefully saving the members of my family would mean offending figures of great authority in the Banto Empire. Are you really willing to do that?”</p> <p>After that surprise, Goode no longer doubted Yang Ling’s identity. He was, at the same time, incredibly excited. Both the Ancient Summoners and Tree Shepherds had powerful abilities. That was evident in how Yang Ling had defeated the terrifying Nine-headed Snake Monster. As long as he helped Yang Ling to the best of his abilities, there was hope of saving the members of his family that had been suffering all this while.</p> <p>“The deal is simple. You will provide me with tactics, and in return, I’ll try my best to save your family!”</p> <p>“Sir, do you speak the truth?”</p> <p>“I’ll swear on the name of the Goddess of Nature. As long as you are loyal to me, I will try my best to save your family!” Yang Ling had secretly used the god the forest elves believed in.</p> <p>It was rumored that the Tree Shepherds were the messengers of the Goddess of Nature. Hearing Yang Ling say this, Goode no longer had any suspicions. He groveled before Yang Ling. In order to save his daughter and old mother, Goode would do anything, much less merely offering tactics.</p>",
  "Chapter 41: An Extraordinary Trouble": "<p>After eating his fill and taking a shower, Goode looked more energetic. Under Yang Ling’s prompting, he started talking about his sad past.</p> <p>It turned out that when he escaped from the capital eighteen years ago, Goode had headed east, finally reaching Wissen Town after much hardship. He had received the admiration of Ymir’s father unintentionally and joined the Anca family after he was promised that they would help save his family.</p> <p>He had not realized at the time that he had slipped into a den of thieves, thieves that would commit all manners of evil!</p> <p>After he became the tactician of the Anca family, Ymir’s father had secretly slipped a Crimson Pill into Goode’s drink while he was distracted. Goode had to consume an antidote once every set amount of time; otherwise, his Magical Energy would gradually dissipate, finally causing his body to rot and suffer a fate worse than death.</p> <p>After Goode drank the poison, Ymir’s father no longer cared about Goode’s request, never mentioning again the promise to save his family. Clinging to the hope of surviving and saving his family, Goode could only tolerate the humiliation for all these years.</p> <p>“The antidote is in the hands of Ymir’s father. He had not returned for a long time, so the elite warriors and spellcasters left to guard the castle have all had reduced abilities!” Goode sighed before he continued, “And because of that, you sir could so easily bring down this castle. Haha, the Anca family sure reaped what they sowed!”</p> <p>Reduced abilities?</p> <p>Hearing Goode say this, Yang Ling had an epiphany. It was no wonder that the Anca family’s defense was so weak. The ferocious guards and powerful spellcasters of the past all felt like ghosts without energy. That was the reason they chose to flee without fighting.</p> <p>They surely reaped what they sowed!</p> <p>After understanding what was going on, Yang Ling secretly shook his head thinking about how lucky he was. With the Anca family’s massive strength, if not for the fact that Ymir’s father had led a large portion of their elite guards out, and that the rest of the warriors and spellcasters had greatly reduced abilities, Ymir might not have taken the risk and died by his hand.</p> <p>“The world is so big, could you not find any other antidotes than the one in Ymir’s father’s hands?” Yang Ling asked curiously, after deliberating for a moment.</p> <p>After shaking his head, Goode said, “It is rumored that the Crimson Pill was a secret formula Ymir’s ancestor unintentionally learned from an Alchemist on an island. Other than the masters of the Anca family, no one knows how the Crimson Pill is formulated, and even more so, how it should be treated. Unless…”</p> <p>Pouring Goode a glass full of rum, Yang Ling waited silently for him to continue. An obvious attack was easy to avoid, but it was difficult to defend himself from an attack from the shadows. If Yang Ling did not understand how the Anca family could poison someone, there could be a day where he would suddenly fall to such a tactic.</p> <p>“All these years, there have been many who were unwilling to help the Anca family abuse the citizens any longer. They silently left the castle to search for antidotes elsewhere. But there were not many who succeeded!” Goode shook his head. “Unless one possesses the Water from the Spring of Life, which can regenerate flesh and dispel all poisons… Otherwise, the Crimson Pill is a death sentence, even if you manage to escape successfully!”</p> <p>Thinking about the lethal poison in his body, Goode’s expression turned dull. The Water from the Spring of Life was incredibly rare. It was rumored that only some ancient tribes of forest elves possessed a little of it. But forest elves were reclusive, preferring to live hidden within the vast Terras Forest. You might not even come across the elves, and even if you were lucky enough to find a tribe, the elves were quite possessive of their precious Water from the Spring of Life!</p> <p>Yang Ling, however, had spent no effort obtaining it!</p> <p>To others, the Water from the Spring of Life was incredibly rare, but since Yang Ling had a symbiotic relationship with the elf tribe, it was not hard for him to obtain a bottle or two.</p> <p>According to the information given to him by the thief Fenlist, there were still many high level Warriors and Spellcasters of the Anca family in the cells. As long as there was enough Water from the Spring of Life to cure them of their poison, coupled with Goode talking them into joining Yang Ling, Yang Ling believed that the majority of them would not want to serve the bloodsucking Anca family any longer. Perhaps he could boost his abilities overnight.</p> <p>Deliberating for a moment, Yang Ling had a preliminary plan. He took out the half a bottle of Water from the Spring of Life he had left and pretended to be nonchalant. “Goode, I still have half a bottle of Water from the Spring of Life. Do you want to see if it has an effect?”</p> <p>Water from the Spring of Life?</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling push over the half bottle of Water from the Spring of Life, Goode was immensely shocked. He had not expected Yang Ling to carry such a valuable item on him at all times. After the shock, Goode thought about Yang Ling’s identity as a Tree Shepherd and was no longer that surprised. He was touched when he saw how generous Yang Ling was.</p> <p>In his excitement, Goode immediately opened the bottle and carefully dropped a few drops of the Water from the Spring of Life into his mouth. He then sat cross-legged and began circulating the Magical Energy in his body while chanting softly. With his foundation as a water type Spellcaster, an increasingly thick white fog started to appear in the hall. The ripples of water type Magical Energy also became stronger and stronger.</p> <p>Sometime later, after sensing that all of the poison in his body was purged, Goode opened his eyes in excitement. He groveled sincerely before Yang Ling. At this moment, Goode finally believed that Yang Ling’s intentions were true. As long as he served Yang Ling to the best of his ability, he could save the suffering members of his family.</p> <p>“Goode, we are a family now, so you need not be too formal. There are still many of your partners in this prison. I’ll let you use the rest of the Water from the Spring of Life as you see fit!”</p> <p>“Yes, I understand!” As a bright tactician, Goode understood what Yang Ling meant without him having to say any more.</p> <p>After his excitement, Goode quickly got into character and began coming up with plans for Yang Ling. He spoke eloquently on various topics, from the deployment of the slaves to the renovations of Wissen Castle, from the recruitment of helpers to the sources of income. Yang Ling could only nod his head.</p> <p>It was hard to protect against a thief from the inside, especially a thief who knew the ins and outs of the family!</p> <p>As their best tactician, Goode had played a role in almost all of the actions of the Anca family, and he knew many of the Anca family’s secrets. Under his specific explanations, Yang Ling quickly understood the personality and temper, as well as the abilities of Ymir’s father. He now knew how to guard against his acts of revenge.</p> <p>“Sir, there is a group of townspeople outside who are adamant about seeing you!” Just as Yang Ling and Goode were about to discuss the next step of the plan, the guard Argus charged in hurriedly.</p> <p>“Argus, you can just talk to the butler Murbaqi for things like this!”</p> <p>Seeing that Yang Ling was a little impatient, the heavily armored Argus said nervously, “Sir, this matter is a little troublesome, and Murbaqi hopes that you can come settle it personally!”</p> <p>Even Murbaqi can’t deal with the situation?</p> <p>Yang Ling was a little curious. Ever since Harribell’s old butler had joined him, the man had impressed Yang Ling with both his methods and abilities. He was an expert in dealing with anything, big or small, and he had always done his job well. The old butler had seen to many things while serving his previous noble family.</p> <p>Yang Ling was not sure of what had happened for the old butler Murbaqi to request that he deal with it personally. Yang Ling skeptically walked out toward the door with the tactician Goode following closely behind him.</p> <p>He had not walked very far when he saw a large group of townspeople gathered around the door of the castle. Some were clenching their teeth, some scolding loudly, and others crying their hearts out. The old butler Murbaqi was standing to the side, silent, his face red. He did not know what was going on.</p> <p>Could it be that the barbarian Jarlock had once again gotten his tribesmen to destroy someone’s house? Or was the thief Fenlist not paying his debts again?</p> <p>Over the last few days, the barbarian Jarlock and thief Fenlist had occasionally caused trouble. But the townspeople had not pursued the matters out of respect for Yang Ling. But this time, the public sentiment seemed to indicate that this was no ordinary trouble.</p>",
  "Chapter 42: Targeting Those That Stood Out": "<p>Seeing Yang Ling’s figure approach, the townspeople crowded forward. This was especially so for a middle-aged lady wearing a rough dress. She knelt before Yang Ling, her tears welling out like spring water. Looking at her, Yang Ling realized that she was the lady who had baked him a large plate of pastries after he succeeded in taking over Wissen Castle, Madam Angelie.</p> <p>“Sir, take pity on my underaged daughter. She has been forced to death by an evil person!” Madam Angelie wept. “Sir, you must help me, sir…”</p> <p>“Yes, this situation is tragic. The lives of the mother and daughter were already very hard, yet they had to meet with something like this!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, if Sir Yang would lead us, we would feed that scoundrel of a soldier to the dogs!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The crowd talked over one another, and eventually brought forward a motionless young lady. Quickly, Yang Ling got a general understanding of what was going on.</p> <p>It turned out that because of their hard lives, the family did not have enough provisions to last them through the winter. Madam Angelie’s daughter, Daymore, would wake up before sunrise every day and head to the edge of the Terras Forest to pick wild vegetables. Unfortunately, she was targeted by a lecherous soldier who abducted her while it was still dark and committed indecent acts.</p> <p>Without the power to retaliate, Daymore had shouted for help. In the end, seeing the other party about to violate her, she had cried out and thrown herself off a cliff. She was covered in blood and in a coma.</p> <p>A coma?</p> <p>Looking at the pale young lady, Yang Ling had a thought. He extended his hand and felt for her breath. Many times, people would lie completely motionless after an accident, but they were only in a state of near-death. If they could help the girl in time, she might be able to regain consciousness.</p> <p>When he was younger, Yang Ling had a neighbor who had accidentally fallen off a cliff while gathering firewood. He was also covered in blood and in a coma. After they buried him, a passerby heard thuds coming from his grave and was incredibly shocked, thinking that he had become a zombie. After his family heard about this, they even borrowed money to employ monks to give him a safe passage to the netherworld.</p> <p>But a year later, while they were relocating the grave, they opened the coffin to see that the dead man’s hand was ramrod straight, with deep scratch marks on multiple parts of the coffin. It was only then that they realized that he had still been breathing when he was buried. He had not died when he fell off the cliff, but was suffocated to death in the coffin. After the mother of the victim realized the truth, she cried every day and became bedridden.</p> <p>“She has not stopped breathing! Quick, get me a basin of water!”</p> <p>Yang Ling discovered that the pitiful young lady still had shallow breathing. It was lucky that his senses were exceptionally sharp after the improvement of his Wizard Powers; otherwise, he would never have detected her breath.</p> <p>Under the confused looks of the crowd, Yang Ling performed mouth to mouth resuscitation on Daymore. He would press on her supple breasts after every breath. After clearing any obstacles from her mouth, Yang Ling fed her a Magical Beast Blood Orb.</p> <p>The Magical Beast Blood Orb condensed using Wizard Power not only harbored immense energy, it also had within it a massive vigor of life. After Magical Beasts like the Evil Eyes or Horned Bee Beasts were heavily injured, they could rapidly recover by consuming a Blood Orb. Yang Ling believed that this Blood Orb gathered from the Nine-headed Snake Demon would be useful in reviving the unconscious Daymore.</p> <p>Indeed, after swallowing the Magical Beast Blood Orb and a few gulps of water, Daymore slowly regained consciousness. Madam Angelie did not know what to say. The people witnessing this event were also in shock.</p> <p>“Murbaqi, bring the mother and daughter in. Prepare some hundred-year ginseng soup for Daymore!” Yang Ling might as well help them until the end. When he learned about the circumstances of their family, Yang Ling had decided to extend a helping hand. After all, he would not be able to finish all of the hundred-year ginseng he found in the Anca family treasury even if he ate it every day until he died.</p> <p>Furthermore, Yang Ling had another intention. After strangely crossing over to this foreign world, in addition to improving his Wizard Power and taming Magical Beasts and tree spirits, he had to establish a good relationship with the townspeople of Wissen Town in order to live a peaceful life here.</p> <p>An old revolutionary had once said that the power of the masses was limitless. There might be some unexpected benefits awaiting Yang Ling if he obtained the admiration and respect of the townspeople. Clearly, extending a helping hand to the poor Madam Angelie and her daughter was an opportunity to promote himself.</p> <p>“Thank you sir, thank you sir…” Madam Angelie was moved to tears. Originally, she had only wanted Yang Ling to seek justice for her from the arrogant soldier. She had not expected Yang Ling to not only save her daughter’s life, but also instruct his butler to treat her daughter’s body with ginseng soup.</p> <p>Madam Angelie did not know exactly how much a hundred-year ginseng was worth, but she knew that when her neighbors dug one up a year ago, they were instantly able to buy a large house in the town square. She knew that she would never be able to repay Yang Ling’s benevolence in this life.</p> <p>Nobility, he was definitely born into nobility!</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling instruct his butler to prepare hundred-year ginseng soup to treat Daymore’s wounds despite never having seen her before, the crowd was shocked. Only a noble who did not lack anything could be so generous, not paying heed to even the precious hundred-year ginseng. Thinking back to how he funded and set up the dwarf weapon shop and the Evening Primrose Bar, then thinking about the guards under Yang Ling, the crowd were all certain that Yang Ling had been born into a rich family.</p> <p>After smiling to the crowd, Yang Ling turned back into the castle. He wanted to grasp every minute and expand the Big Dipper Spirit Gathering Spell Formation. The larger the Spirit Gathering Formation, the faster it could gather the spiritual energy in the surroundings. That would allow him to achieve double the results with half the effort. Furthermore, after sourcing the suitable ingredients, Yang Ling was prepared to set up a large scale Tracking Spell Formation in order to prevent powerful enemies from secretly infiltrating the castle.</p> <p>“Sir, please wait!” Yang Ling had not taken many steps when a white-haired old man walked out holding a crutch. “Sir, we have to bring the culprit to justice. Otherwise, the people of the town will be fearful. The tragedy that Daymore faced might befall other young ladies!”</p> <p>“That’s right, we must not forgive the culprit, we have to capture him!”</p> <p>“Capture the culprit!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Even though they had removed the Anca family from a position of power, there were still many hoodlums within Wissen Town. There were many vile soldiers and adventurers, even those with a taste for murder. A day without chasing these people away would mean a day where the townspeople could not rest easy. To deal with this, the townspeople had placed their hopes on Yang Ling’s massive power.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling silently deliberating, the tactician Goode whispered, “Sir, this is an opportunity. As I have understood just now, this is a new batch of troops that have come to Wissen Town. They are very arrogant. More and more troops and adventurers are entering Wissen Town, and the social landscape is getting increasingly complicated. Attacking this group of troops who are standing out can not only enhance your prestige, it is also beneficial to the next stage of our plans!”</p> <p>Over this period of time, there had been an increasing number of troops and explorers drifting into Wissen Town, following the news of the discovery of a dragon’s treasure deep within Terras Forest. With this many barbaric people gathered together, it was inevitable that fights would break out. Other than Yang Ling’s dwarf weapon shop and Evening Primrose Bar, most of the other shops in town had been harassed time and time again. The security in town was getting worse.</p> <p>“Oh, then is there any negative implications?” Yang Ling murmured to Goode skeptically. Tactics should precede actions. Before Yang Ling acted, he had to first consider the worst case scenario, just in case he was caught off guard.</p> <p>“If we are to do this, we have to succeed. Otherwise, the situation might take a turn for the worst!”</p> <p>Looking at Yang Ling deliberating silently, Goode was on alert. Compared to the rash, arrogant Ymir, Yang Ling was a fox. In order to improve his status in Yang Ling’s heart, every plan, every word Goode said had to be thought out carefully.</p> <p>“Alright, we must not fail. Argus, order Casey to gather our warriors!” It was fine if Yang Ling was not going to act. But since he was, Yang Ling was going to spare no effort.</p>",
  "Chapter 43: I Want Someone’s Head": "<p>There was a barren area in the northwestern corner of Wissen Town, and many soldiers and adventurers had set up their tents there. Whenever they had no missions to occupy them, the energetic troops would drink and fight with each other, or perhaps find a few prostitutes to quell their lust.</p> <p>Often, in the dead of night, when the ordinary townspeople were already fast asleep, this place in the northwestern corner of the town would still be in a rowdy mood. Sounds of gambling, each wave louder than the next. Sounds of brawls and shouts, as well as the shrill moans of the ladies… The sounds would continue through the night.</p> <p>Even though they were unhappy about the foreign troops and adventurers, the townspeople did not dare speak up against them. They were already thankful that these troops did not bully them. How would the townspeople dare to find trouble with them!</p> <p>Waking up, Sangdela stretched and violently shook the naked lady beside him. He had encountered a beautiful girl yesterday night while he was hunting, and he had pulled her to the side of a cliff with the intention of violating her. But he hadn’t expected that the fiery girl to choose to throw herself off the cliff rather than submit to him.</p> <p>When he returned to the outpost, Sangdela was overcome by lust. He felt that the situation was unjust, and he hired a prostitute to quell his frustrations. He toyed with the prostitute for two hours, torturing her to no end.</p> <p>“Sir, I cannot carry on any longer, please spare me!” Seeing Sangdela raise the whip in his hand, the prostitute turned pale in shock. If she had known that Sangdela was this perverted, she would not have accepted this business no matter how much money she was paid.</p> <p>Striking down with the whip, Sangdela said fiercely, “You filthy wh*re, I paid the money. I can play with you however I want!”</p> <p>Seeing the beautiful lady shiver in fear, Sangdela felt a sense of joy. But, just as he was about to penetrate the lady, cries of alarm came from outside the door. Following which, a flustered guard charged into the tent. “Sir, the situation is bad. The old master wants you to put on your armor and come outside immediately!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, are you asking for death, charging in at this time?!” In his fury, Sangdela struck at the guard with his whip, completely disregarding his words. The latter let out a pathetic wail, and he could only press on his wound and retreat.</p> <p>In the tent, Sangdela was livid. Outside the tent, the troops were quickly gathering. Many of them were not expecting this and were unprepared, some barefoot, others still pulling up their pants. But they were all unwilling to display weakness, their fierce gazes staring straight at the large group in front of them.</p> <p>A provocation? Or had a soldier ignited some sort of conflict?</p> <p>Seeing the heavily armored group of warriors before them, Jaynowese felt a little depressed. He had just arrived at Wissen Town yesterday, and he had intended to start his secret mission today after a comfortable nap. He had not expected to meet with this kind of trouble the moment he woke up. What made him even angrier was that his good-for-nothing son was still lying in the embrace of a woman.</p> <p>After making the decision, Yang Ling had led his guards over rapidly. In the group, the heavily armored barbarians took the front line, giant axes in hand. The elf warriors and other swordsmen were huddled tightly around Yang Ling. Finally, behind them were a large group of furious townspeople.</p> <p>“I am Jaynowese, captain of the Wind Troops. Is there some misunderstanding between us?” Jaynowese spoke first after squinting his eyes and deliberating for a moment.</p> <p>“So, you are the leader of the troops, pardon the disrespect!” Yang Ling had a cold smile. “I came here to retrieve something!”</p> <p>Retrieve something? Could they be the landlords who have come to collect protection money?</p> <p>Before coming to Wissen Town, Jaynowese had already heard that the town was occupied by a powerful family that committed all manners of atrocities, their main means of business being slave trade and abduction. He had wanted to pay them a visit to establish good terms with them, just in case he offended them in any way in the future. To think that they would meet face to face this soon.</p> <p>The Wind Troops were famous within the Banto Empire. There were 250 elite warriors under Jaynowese, of which there were twenty high level Swordsmen and three Great Swordsmen. Furthermore, there were also two Great Spellcasters and five high level Spellcasters, their abilities strong.</p> <p>Even though the other party had heavily armored barbarians and forest elves who were adept in archery, Jaynowese was not particularly worried. Seeing the messy backline of the other party, Jaynowese understood that they were only a bunch of rowdy townspeople. Even though his troops were not fully dressed, this landlord would not be a match for him even if they were to engage in battle.</p> <p>He had once sought shelter in the house of a small noble as he was escorting a caravan of provisions to the capital. His son had become drunk and violated the beautiful daughter of the family. The noble, in his fury, gathered all of the warriors within his area of influence, a full thousand men. But the Wind Troops had easily defeated him in the end.</p> <p>Later, the noble went to launch a complaint in the capital. The complaint was suppressed by the troops backstage, and he was instead branded as a criminal who harbored thieves and rapists. He was then reduced to a commoner, losing his land and treasures. His beautiful daughter was sold to a brothel in the capital.</p> <p>With their powerful abilities, coupled with a figure of high authority backing them, the soldiers of the Wind Troops believed that they could have their way no matter which noble they came across. Facing a small hoodlum like Yang Ling, who could only have his way in Wissen Town, they did not pay much heed to him.</p> <p>Because of the lack of information and the fact that they had just arrived at Wissen Town, the soldiers of the Wind Troops did not know that the Anca family in Wissen Town had been eradicated. If they had known the truth, if they had known of Yang Ling’s identity and abilities, they might have immediately gotten into formation and taken Yang Ling seriously.</p> <p>After a nonchalant grunt, Jaynowese stared icily at the brazen Yang Ling. He slowly said, “Oh, we have just arrived at Wissen Town. Might I ask what you wish to retrieve?”</p> <p>“It’s nothing much, just someone’s head!” Seeing the other party’s untidy attire and how they were belittling him, Yang Ling’s smile became even more radiant.</p> <p>Someone’s head?</p> <p>Jaynowese had thought that Yang Ling wished to extort him and ask for a large sum of money as a protection fee. But unexpectedly, the young man had asked for someone’s head. Could it be that some ignorant soldier had done something last night that should not see the light of day? Or could it be that the opposing faction of the person backing them had known of his secret mission and had sent these local hoodlums to cause trouble?</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, they sure are tired of living!”</p> <p>“Hmph, to disturb the old master this early in the morning and even ask for someone’s head. What a joke. You’re asking for death!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Jaynowese deliberated quietly, but the boorish soldiers started to erupt into a commotion, shouting at the top of their lungs. All these years, not a single soul had dared to be so brazen in front of them.</p> <p>Not knowing the truth, Jaynowese had mistaken Yang Ling and his group for the Anca family. Even though he did not care too much about this family of pirates who only played on their advantage in numbers, Jaynowese did not want any extra trouble that might keep him from successfully completing his mission. He had hoped not to offend the family. But he did not expect the other party to be so brazen as to look for someone’s head this early in the morning.</p> <p>Amidst the shouting of the Wind Troops, more and more adventurers and troops gathered to witness the commotion. Jaynowese, who had just arrived in Wissen Town, might not be clear of Yang Ling’s abilities, but the adventurers and troops who personally witnessed Yang Ling killing a Nine-headed Snake Monster understood perfectly. No one was clearer than them how terrifying an army of Magical Beasts was in a large scale battle.</p>",
  "Chapter 44: Trample on his Privates": "<p>Seeing the troops shouting, unaware of their fates, Yang Ling let out a cold laugh. He whispered something in Argus’s ear, and the latter left to execute his orders. Quickly, the warriors split into groups of five men and spread sideways, five groups to a unit. A large piece of empty land appeared behind Yang Ling.</p> <p>Jaynowese was confused about the other party’s strange actions. Could it be that Yang Ling wanted to surround them? He could not understand what the young man was doing. At the same time, the troops and adventurers watching them had some idea of Yang Ling’s intentions, so they retreated back at the same time. No one wanted to be a living target for the Magical Beast army.</p> <p>Just as Jaynowese was doubtful and confused, the satisfied Sangdela walked out, his steps light. “Ah, these ladies are great!”</p> <p>Sangdela had just walked out when the crowd recognized him. They all started cursing at him.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, it’s that guy who nearly killed Daymore!”</p> <p>“That’s right, it’s him! Kill this beast of a man!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Hearing the waves of curses, each louder than the last, Jaynowese gained a general understanding of what was going on. His son had been spoiled since he was young, and now that he was older, he committed atrocities frequently, thinking he could get away with them because of his status. But Jaynowese had not expected his good-for-nothing son to get into this much trouble the first night they had arrived here.</p> <p>“Sir, perhaps there is a misunderstanding between us. How about some sort of recompense? The Wind Troops do not have many things, but we can spare a few thousand crystal coins!”</p> <p>As he watched Yang Ling’s soldiers backing away in retreat, Jaynowese, who had years of experience in battles, had a feeling of unease. But he could not just hand over Sangdela like that. Sangdela was his only child. He would not hand him over no matter what atrocities he had committed.</p> <p>The Wind Troops?</p> <p>The crowd only noticed the logo of a wolf’s head on Jaynowese’s tent after hearing his words. They all gasped.</p> <p>The Wind Troops were powerful and had gotten their way in the Banto Empire for years. They had never heard of the Wind Troops making any mistakes, and each of their missions earned them crates full of gold. It was rumored that they had a powerful figure backing them in the capital, hence the reason they didn’t have to be afraid of anything.</p> <p>After the initial shock, the spectating troops and adventurers broke into whispers. Word of the Wind Troops had spread far and wide, and their abilities were known to be powerful. But Yang Ling did not pale in comparison. He had heavily armored barbarians, master archers in the forest elves, as well as his terrifying army of Magical Beasts. They did not know who would have the last laugh if the two were to engage in battle.</p> <p>Looking at the large group of men before him, Sangdela lazily rubbed his eyes. He was not interested in battles, as he preferred to spend his day with women. He just wanted to see if there was a suitable target for him within the crowd. Otherwise, how was he going to spend the long night when today was over?</p> <p>Suddenly, he had a glint in his eyes. He saw the lady who had jumped from the cliff yesterday. Recovering from his surprise, he called, “Hey, little beauty, I let you off last night. Why have you sent yourself to me today?”</p> <p>After learning that Yang Ling would lead his troops and seek justice for her, Daymore had insisted that she come, despite being injured. She wanted to personally witness Sangdela’s end. Seeing this perverted man not only deny his crimes, but also humiliate her in front of everybody, her body trembled in fury, nearly causing her to fall. In that moment, the blood of the townspeople boiled. They wanted to beat Sangdela to death.</p> <p>Just as Casey and the rest were furious and wanting to battle, Goode secretly came to Yang Ling’s side and whispered, “Sir, the preparations are ready. A large portion of the troops and adventurers are here to witness this. It’s time to attack!”</p> <p>In order to warn the others and instill fear into the hearts of the brazen troops and adventurers, Yang Ling had instructed Goode to lead a group to promote the battle. Goode had gathered a large number of the troops and adventurers who were currently in the town to witness this battle. As long as they could defeat the Wind Troops in front of everyone, Yang Ling believed that the other troops and adventurers would have to restrain themselves and think before they acted.</p> <p>“Captain, hand his head over, then leave Wissen Town immediately with your men. Otherwise, haha, don’t blame me for being nasty!” Pointing to Sangdela, who was ignorant of his fate, Yang Ling had a cold glow in his eyes.</p> <p>He wants my head?</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, Sangdela broke into laughter, as if he had just heard the greatest joke in the continent. “Rubbish! Speaking nonsense so early in the morning. I had thought that you were some formidable figure. To think that you are just a foolish Sharo Boar!”</p> <p>Foolish Sharo Boar?</p> <p>Seeing how brazen Sangdela was, the spectating troops and adventurers shook their heads. Yang Ling’s warriors were all heavily armored, clearly prepared for this battle. On the other hand, some of the soldiers of the Wind Troops were barefoot, others slowly tying the belts around their trousers. They were obviously unprepared. No matter how powerful the soldiers were, they would definitely suffer heavy casualties if they fought Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Brother, three hundred Black Crystal Coins! We’ll wager to see if the Wind Troops can retreat without suffering any casualties, are you in?”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, three hundred is too little, I’ll bet a thousand on the Wind Troops being completely defeated!”</p> <p>“Hehe, I’ll bet five hundred on each. The two seem evenly matched!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing a large battle about to start, the troops who were addicted to gambling started placing their bets. Some placed bets on the Wind Troops’ complete defeat, while some bet on a draw. Some who had witnessed how powerful the soldiers of the Wind Troops were bet on them achieving a great victory. They were of the impression that Yang Ling would not be able to display the full might of his Magical Beast army at such a close distance.</p> <p>Looking at the brazen Sangdela, Yang Ling let out a cold grunt. In one breath, he summoned all of his Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts. The Evil Eyes were responsible for the offense, while the speedy Horned Bee Beasts were tasked to defend.</p> <p>“Not good, the magic barrier, quick!” Seeing Yang Ling instantly summon a large army of Magical Beasts, Jaynowese turned pale and staggered as he issued the command.</p> <p>Jaynowese had not completed his sentence when the experienced Spellcasters he had under him joined forces and conjured a magic barrier. They were even more sensitive to danger than the warriors at the frontline. But they had still underestimated the power of the collective attacks of the Evil Eyes. After a concentrated flurry of light beams, the earth barrier that could even defend against a high level magic spell instantly vaporized.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, charge forward!” Tilting his body to avoid a light beam, Jaynowese reacted quickly. He took the forefront, charging toward Yang Ling, fast as lightning. As he circulated the Battle Energy in his body, his spear radiated a glaring red light.</p> <p>At the same time, under his command, a dozen elite soldiers charged forward like the wind, toward Yang Ling who was not far away. Their gleaming swords and soaring Battle Energy caused the spectators to gasp. To be able to deploy ten high level Swordsmen in an instant, their abilities were strong indeed.</p> <p>The people spectating the battle were incredibly nervous, but Yang Ling was confident, his expression unchanging. Ever since he had advanced to the level of Spirit Wizard, the abilities of his Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes were unlike the past. He believed that as long as he was expecting the attack, his Horned Bee Beasts could protect him well enough that an ordinary person would not be able to get near him.</p> <p>Slice him in half, or capture him and torture him slowly?</p> <p>Looking at Yang Ling, who seemed to be motionless from the shock, Jaynowese let out a cold smile, once again accelerating. Even though he did not know how Yang Ling could have summoned such a large number of Magical Beasts in an instant, Jaynowese was still confident that with his abilities, Yang Ling would not have the power to retaliate if he closed in on him. In his hurry, he failed to notice the tentacles of the Evil Eyes turning redder.</p> <p>Just as Jaynowese lifted the sword in his hand high and prepared to deal the fatal blow, something surprising happened!</p> <p>The Evil Eyes behind Yang Ling, who were charging up their attack, released bolts of intense light. There was a blindingly powerful white light. In that instant, the spectators around them felt pain in their eyes, as if they had been pierced by a needle. As for Jaynowese, who was at the forefront, he felt as though his eyes had been stabbed by several blades. In that moment, he was like a blind man, unable to see anything.</p> <p>Flash grenade?</p> <p>Seeing Jaynowese and the rest move around like headless flies, Yang Ling could not help but be impressed by the power of the Evil Eyes’ beams of light. He thought back to the military magazines he had read in the past and felt that these beams of blinding light were even more powerful than the flash grenades used by the US army.</p> <p>I cannot miss this opportunity!</p> <p>Seeing the other party in chaos, Yang Ling ordered his Horned Bee Beasts to charge forward. Even though the loss of vision was temporary, it was enough time for the speedy Horned Bee Beasts. In front of their sharp fangs, in front of their poisonous stingers, the soldiers who hadn’t had enough time to put on their heavy armor fell instantly. They were as helpless as a naked lady in front of a pervert.</p> <p>Defeat, utter defeat!</p> <p>The Wind Troops had underestimated their enemy and were caught off guard. The soldiers tried their best to open their eyes and hide, each man fighting for himself. They had suffered an unprecedented defeat. With their temporary loss of vision, the Spellcasters were unable to cast powerful spells. The warriors were also unable to defend themselves against the Horned Bee Beasts, unable to fight at their full power. No one would have expected Yang Ling to have such a terrifying secret weapon.</p> <p>“Go, attack them from the inside!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, break their legs!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing the troops unable to retaliate, the townspeople swarmed forward, unable to tolerate them any longer. Punches and kicks rained down on the soldiers, causing them to cry for their mommies, their flesh tearing. As for the arrogant Sangdela, he received special treatment from the townspeople.</p> <p>By the time Yang Ling sent someone to drag the lecher out, Sangdela was already covered in blood, his breathing shallow. His neck had been fractured, and his privates had been trampled to a paste. He might not have been saved even if God were to descend upon the earth.</p>",
  "Chapter 45: The Little Lass That Matured Early": "<p>With victory in his hands, Yang Ling recalled the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts. He instructed Casey to tie up the soldiers rolling on the ground. They placed Jaynowese, who had been covered with stingers until he looked like a porcupine, onto a stretcher. They were going to find a priest to treat his injuries, temporarily letting him live. This man was the leader of the troops. Yang Ling might be able to learn valuable information after interrogating him for a few days.</p> <p>Yang Ling had easily achieved victory. At the same time, looking at the completely defeated Wind Troops, the surrounding troops and adventurers witnessing this battle all gasped, unable to collect themselves.</p> <p>Shocking, it was too shocking.</p> <p>The abilities of the Wind Troops were well known throughout the Banto Empire. They were powerful, with several Great Swordsmen and Great Spellcasters within their ranks. Even though they knew that the Wind Troops underestimated Yang Ling and were poorly prepared, no one expected them to crumble so easily under Yang Ling’s army of Magical Beasts.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling had quickly recalled his Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes, several sharp-eyed troops and adventurers had noticed that his Magical Beasts were a little different from before. They understood that they had gained powerful abilities after they evolved.</p> <p>An army of Magical Beasts that could evolve?</p> <p>The troops and adventurers who understood why Yang Ling had obtained such an easy victory swallowed hard. The abilities of the massive Magical Beast army were already terrifying enough; if they could evolve continuously, then their abilities would be beyond imagination! Wild Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes could not evolve easily. Under normal circumstances, there might not even be one lucky enough to evolve out of ten thousand. That was also the reason why they were regarded as useless Magical Beasts.</p> <p>But the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes Yang Ling summoned had done it. Thousands of them had evolved at once!</p> <p>The sharp-eyed troops and adventurers were immensely shocked. They knew that in a small town like Wissen Town, no one was Yang Ling’s rival.</p> <p>Seeing Casey tie up all of the soldiers from the Wind Troops, Yang Ling summoned his Unicorn and stared coldly at the spectating troops and adventurers. “Wissen Town welcomes honest merchants and upright troops, but we do not tolerate evildoers who would commit all manner of atrocities. I request that you take heed. Otherwise, the Wind Troops are your example!”</p> <p>Take heed?</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling leave on his Unicorn, then looking at Goode and the rest who were promoting the fight, the spectating troops and adventurers had an epiphany. They understood why Yang Ling had made a big deal out of this.</p> <p>“Brothers, let us do fewer misdeeds in the future. Even if you are not afraid of death, don’t drag your brothers down with you!” Looking at the many heavily armored barbarians, thinking back to the cold gaze Yang Ling gave before leaving, a troop whispered a word of caution to his happy-go-lucky partners.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, we did not cause trouble at his weapons shop or his Evening Primrose Bar. He is not a leader either, so what right does he have to interfere with what we do?” One of the happy-go-lucky troops felt that the way they were treated was a little unjust. But thinking about Yang Ling’s power, he did not dare speak loudly, only silently muttering under his breath.</p> <p>“Hmph, there are more and more people entering Wissen Town, and the security is getting worse. It is about time someone stepped up and cared!” Seeing the happy-go-lucky troops still feeling a little irritated, a middle-aged troop shook his head and continued, “Mike, listen to your brother, and don’t go fooling around for the time being!”</p> <p>“Yes, even the powerful Wind Troops are not their match, much less a small group like us!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>After a moment’s silence, the spectating troops and adventurers broke into whispers, all warning their dishonest partners. Be it larger teams of troops or wanderers who preferred to work alone, all of them had witnessed how the Wind Troops ended up. They were afraid that they would become the targets of Yang Ling’s army of Magical Beasts if they committed too many misdeeds.</p> <p>After the crowd scattered, the black-robed elder and Maryse walked out from behind a giant rock. Originally, they were going to scout the Terras Forest and search for traces of where the Holy Dragon sealed the treasures. But they had coincidentally wandered across the show.</p> <p>“Hehe, not bad! Killing one to warn the others, even boosting his prestige and obtaining respect! Unfortunately…” Seeing the troops and adventurers leaving the area, the black-robed elder shook his head.</p> <p>“Unfortunately he is not a member of the Dark Association; otherwise, he would be nurtured with all of our resources!” Having followed her teacher for many years, Maryse understood what he meant. She had a thought. “Teacher, why not let me see if he is willing to join the association?”</p> <p>“That’s fine, but you must act carefully. You must not be too reckless!” Seeing Maryse’s eyes darting back and forth, the black-robed elder understood what she meant. But Yang Ling was calm and sharp. He did not look like a noble who would only think using the lower half of his body.</p> <p>In front of her teacher, Maryse agreed on the surface. But in her heart, she was secretly thinking about how she could get close to Yang Ling. With her improving Dark Temptation, she believed that Yang Ling would willingly grovel before her dress if she used a few tricks.</p> <p>Far away, after letting out a sneeze, Yang Ling rubbed his nose, wondering who was thinking about him. Patting the Unicorn’s head, Yang Ling got it to slow down. Quickly, Goode caught up to him.</p> <p>“Sir, what are we going to do with the captive Wind Troops?”</p> <p>“Oh, what do you think?” Sitting atop his white Unicorn, Yang Ling looked silently at the sweating Goode.</p> <p>Wiping the sweat off his forehead, Goode slowly said, “In my opinion, we have already achieved our motive of instilling fear. For the next step, we can send someone to inform the family of the captives that they are available in exchange for a large ransom!”</p> <p>“Hehe, not bad! We can extort them!” Yang Ling smiled. He thought of an idea that could kill two birds with one stone, “But before we receive the ransom, we cannot let them live on for free. We shall get them to build an inn!”</p> <p>As for the leader of the Wind Troops, Jaynowese, Yang Ling would naturally not spare him, since the man could bring him trouble in the future. But as for the ordinary troops, their actions did not warrant death. Of course, they could avoid death, but they couldn’t avoid punishment. Yang Ling had to punish them somehow. Clearly, using them as free labor was not a bad idea.</p> <p>Furthermore, it was not a good idea for the troops and adventurers to freely set up tents outdoors without restraint. Since he had this many free laborers, Yang Ling might as well build a large inn. Not only would it be good for housing the foreign troops and adventurers, it would also allow him to exercise a greater amount of control over them. As long as he managed the place well, he might even be able to earn a substantial amount. It was three birds with one stone.</p> <p>Build an inn?</p> <p>After being shocked for a moment, Goode clapped in support. Wissen Town did not have many things, but it had many tall ancient trees and stones. As long as they had enough manpower, they could quickly build a massive inn.</p> <p>Without any more delays, in order to pick the most suitable location, Yang Ling and Goode made a few rounds in the town. They finally decided on a piece of barren land not far away from the castle, about five golf courses in size. Even though it was incomparable to the massive Wissen Castle, it was much better than a small, rowdy inn.</p> <p>Since he was going to build an inn, Yang Ling was going to spare no effort. Wissen Town was rich in resources and had a good climate. There would definitely be more and more people coming to Wissen Town. He need not have to worry about profits if he managed the inn well. Merely looking at how many tents were set up in the northwestern sector was proof of the human traffic in the town. After a comfortable inn was set up, who would be foolish enough to camp in the outdoors and become food for the mosquitoes?</p> <p>After dealing with some important details, it was already late at night when Yang Ling returned to the castle. Even the servants had all gone to bed, much less Argus, Casey, and the rest of the warriors who had been toiling for the entire day. But what surprised Yang Ling was that Alice was still silently waiting for him under the orange light of an oil lamp.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, here are some fish and meat, which are tender and tasty. Here are some dried lamb shanks as well…” Yang Ling had just sat down when Alice brought out plates of delicacies, as if she was performing magic. They were all dishes Yang Ling liked to eat.</p> <p>After gulping down his food, he saw Alice silently looking at him. Yang Ling sighed and asked casually, “Alice, why haven’t you gone to bed when it’s so late at night?”</p> <p>“I… I slept during the day. I am not tired!” Alice would blush every time she lied. Even she noticed that she was not being natural. How could she fool Yang Ling?</p> <p>This little lass!</p> <p>After shaking his head, Yang Ling did not say anything more. He relaxed as Alice waited on him, trying all of the delicacies on the table.</p> <p>After Yang Ling was done with his dinner, Alice followed Yang Ling into his room. She tidied his bed, then quickly brought in a basin of warm water.</p> <p>“Alice, are you not tired?” Seeing Alice working up a sweat, Yang Ling once again shook his head.</p> <p>Massaging Yang Ling’s shoulders, Alice said softly, “Brother Yang, I am not tired. Waiting on you is the most enjoyable thing for me in a day!”</p> <p>Enjoying Alice’s superb massage, Yang Ling relaxed entirely. He instinctively said, “Any lad a little lass like you marries will be very blissful. When that time comes, I’ll give you a big dowry!”</p> <p>Give her a big dowry?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, Alice did not know why, but her mood soured a little. After pausing for a moment, she said with determination, “No, Brother Yang, I’ll not marry even if you kill me. I wish to be able to wait on you all my life. I do not want anything else. I am happy even if I have simple fare every day!”</p> <p>Wait on me all her life?</p> <p>Turning back to look at Alice and her red eyes, then looking at the perky bumps on her chest, Yang Ling had a bitter smile. Even though this lass was a beautiful young girl, she was not even fourteen. If he was living in the city he was before, he might have…</p>",
  "Chapter 46: Alarming": "<p>Waking up, Yang Ling shook his head when he saw the little lass Alice sprawled by the side of his bed. He gently put a coat over her. Winter was approaching, and the weather was getting colder. An average person would catch a cold if they weren’t paying attention.</p> <p>After putting the coat over her, Yang Ling pushed back Alice’s messy hair. Looking at her tender skin, fair neck, and long eyelashes, a strange feeling suddenly welled up in his heart. He could not help himself, bending forward and giving her a kiss on the forehead.</p> <p>This foolish lass!</p> <p>Thinking back to what Alice said about wishing to wait on him all her life, Yang Ling shook his head and softly walked out of the room. He did not notice Alice’s face turn red, nor did he see the tears welling in her eyes.</p> <p>The late-autumn dawn of Wissen Town was veiled with a layer of fog, and many of the people were still asleep as Yang Ling strolled down the winding path. The end of the path was the largest, most mysterious primordial forest in the Tailun Continent. The fog grew thicker the closer he got to Terras Forest.</p> <p>Could he have unintentionally arrived at Shangri-La?</p> <p>Taking a breath of the crisp air, hearing the cries of bugs, Yang Ling felt very relaxed. A breeze blew past, making Yang Ling so comfortable that even his pores relaxed.</p> <p>He walked for about the time it took to burn half a joss stick. Suddenly, Yang Ling felt that something was off. The pagoda shaped mark on his forehead became hotter, as if warning him of some danger. The surroundings were too quiet. There were no sounds of wind, no cries of bugs. It was terrifyingly silent.</p> <p>He had just opened his eyes when he heard a “whoosh.” An arrow was flying toward him, fast as lightning. The tip of the arrow was black and shiny, clearly coated with a strong poison.</p> <p>Alarmed, Yang Ling tilted his body to avoid the poisonous arrow. To his surprise, he hadn’t even had the time to take another breath when a shadowy figure rose from a pile of dead leaves before him and pounced toward him, fast as lightning.</p> <p>“Pervert, give me your life!” the shadowy figure shouted as she leaped. Just from her voice, Yang Ling realized that she was an old opponent, the female assassin that would not leave him alone.</p> <p>Quickly widening the distance between the assassin and himself, Yang Ling said sarcastically, “You, miss, are always as passionate as fire whenever we are on a date. Could it be that you are missing me just because we have not met for a few days?”</p> <p>“You… You pervert, you despicable gangster, hand over your life!”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s evil smile, the female assassin could not help but remember the awkward incident of her previous failed attempt. Thinking back to his chiseled abs, his naked lower body, and his privates that were full of vigor, the female assassin’s face turned red, her body trembling.</p> <p>“My little beauty, you gifted me a shoe the other time. What other presents do you have for me today?” Once again avoiding the sneak attack of the female assassin, Yang Ling said with a smile, “Could it be that you are now prepared to offer me your body?</p> <p>Offer him my body?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling mocking her, the female assassin clenched her teeth in fury. She flailed the dagger in hot pursuit of Yang Ling. But Yang Ling was like a fish, twisting to the sides, easily avoiding her relentless attacks.</p> <p>Ever since he had advanced to the level of Spirit Wizard, Yang Ling had not only greatly improved his Wizard Power, his constitution had experienced a massive improvement as well. In a short span of time, even the speedy Horned Bee Beasts could not keep up with his pace, much less the female assassin before him. Her dagger was coated with a lethal poison, but he had no problems avoiding her attacks.</p> <p>“Pervert, stop dodging if you dare!”</p> <p>“Haha, my little beauty, for our future happiness, come. I’ll kiss you if you manage to catch me!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing the angry female assassin, looking at her blushing face, Yang Ling was deliberately antagonizing her. The angrier she got, the more easily she would lose control and be unable to display her abilities to their fullest potential. As long as he timed it right, Yang Ling believed that he could suppress her with just one move.</p> <p>Because of Yang Ling’s provocations, the female assassin indeed fell for his tricks. She clenched her teeth, trying even harder to attack Yang Ling’s swaying figure. She was using all of her physical strength, completely forgetting the assassin’s principle of retreating after one strike. Not long after, Yang Ling’s speed had barely decreased, but she had already used up all her energy. She was getting more and more powerless.</p> <p>Seeing the opportunity about to present itself, Yang Ling prepared himself to bring down the female assassin. Unexpectedly, the pagoda shaped mark on his forehead started throbbing wildly. He had just instinctively shifted his body to the left when a sharp dagger sliced past his stomach. A masked male assassin had appeared silently out of thin air.</p> <p>The dark dull dagger, his icy gaze, massive ripples of Magical Energy and soaring killing intent… Yang Ling’s pupils dilated. Yang Ling only needed a single glance to determine that this man was a top-notch killer amongst assassins.</p> <p>“Gulania, fall back!”</p> <p>After missing his attack, the veiled assassin ordered the female assassin to fall back. He then raised his dagger and charged toward Yang Ling like the wind. He was incredibly fast, his movements swaying from left to right. Yang Ling could not deduce the direction and angle he was going to attack him from.</p> <p>Exercising caution, Yang Ling quickly retreated. He formed a hand gesture with his right hand, preparing to summon his Magical Beasts. However, he did not expect the veiled assassin to utter an incantation. A beam of blinding white light appeared out of nowhere. Following that, Yang Ling felt his body drained of energy, his limbs turning icy and numb. He slumped helplessly onto the ground.</p> <p>Looking at Yang Ling, his limbs rigid, the veiled assassin let out an icy laugh. He raised his poisoned dagger and walked slowly toward Yang Ling. “Hehe, before a heaven-ranked assassin, a Summoner like you wouldn’t stand a chance even if you could summon a Magical Beast like the Giant Dragon. The time it takes for you to summon a Magical Beast is enough for me to deal the killing blow!”</p> <p>Heaven-ranked assassin?</p> <p>Yang Ling’s heart sank. Through his chats with Casey and the rest during his free time, he knew that heaven-ranked assassins were experts on the same level as Sword Saints and Magical Tutors. There were rumors that claimed that even Magical Tutors with unfathomable magical abilities could not hold their own against a sneak attack from a heaven-ranked assassin.</p> <p>“The Anca family committed many evil deeds, and I eradicated them. Why are you still serving them?” Unable to move, Yang Ling thought hard, trying his best to stall for time. At the same time, he circulated all of the Wizard Power in his body, hoping to recover as soon as possible. Since his entire body had turned numb, Yang Ling wasn’t hoping for a complete recovery. All he wanted to do was move his fingers. As long as he could complete a hand gesture, he would be able to summon his Magical Beasts to aid him in battle.</p> <p>He would never know if he didn’t try! Yang Ling noticed that the Wizard Power in his body had to get through multiple dams, making it hard for it to circulate. In that moment, he did not know what magical spell he had been afflicted by. His heart sank even deeper.</p> <p>“Haha, no one would reject money. If you are going to blame someone, blame it on your bad luck!” Yang Ling had fast reactions, but the veiled assassin was not dumb either. He pressed forward with his dagger as he spoke, just in case of any sudden turn of events. After all, his opponent was a Summoner with unfathomable abilities. He would not dare be careless.</p> <p>“Little beauty, if you don’t come kiss your lover for the last time, you’ll never have another chance!” Seeing the veiled assassin’s dagger press closer toward his throat, Yang Ling was incredibly nervous. When his peripheral vision landed on the female assassin named Gulania, Yang Ling suddenly had an idea.</p>",
  "Chapter 47: Spider Valley": "<p>Kiss him?</p> <p>As expected, after hearing Yang Ling say this, the female assassin Gulania clenched her teeth in fury. She charged forward and gave him a sharp kick before scolding loudly, “D*mn pervert, bloody gangster, you do not know how to repent even though you are on death’s door!”</p> <p>She had encountered many perverts in her life, but she has never seen one who was this indecent!</p> <p>Gulania was shaking in anger. She had never expected Yang Ling to be this despicable even when he was about to be killed. Thinking back to the awkward incident in the past, she wanted badly to sever his tongue. Yang Ling’s naked lower body, his arousal… She could not get the image out of her mind. She felt ashamed and angry every time she remembered that scene.</p> <p>Being interrupted by Gulania, the veiled assassin paused, giving Yang Ling valuable time. Miraculously, after Gulania had kicked him hard near his dantian, Yang Ling discovered that the Wizard Power in his body was beginning to slowly circulate. He slowly regained feeling in his fingers.</p> <p>“Not good, Gulania, move away!” Seeing the cold glint in Yang Ling’s eyes, the experienced veiled assassin knew that something bad was about to happen. He pushed the furious Gulania to the side and whipped his sharp dagger toward Yang Ling’s neck.</p> <p>The veiled assassin acted fast, but he was still a step too slow. Gulania exclaimed in shock as a ten meter tall Withered Tree Warrior appeared in front of her out of thin air.</p> <p>After Yang Ling narrowly avoided the killing blow of the veiled assassin, the Withered Tree Warrior hoisted Yang Ling’s body into the air and sprinted for Wissen Castle. It was incredibly fast, every stride covering tens of meters and jetting up streams of dust and debris.</p> <p>The Withered Tree Warrior had great speed, but it was unable to free them from the terrifying heaven-ranked assassin. Soon, the other party had caught up to them. Without saying a word, the assassin stabbed his sharp dagger into the Withered Tree Warrior’s foot.</p> <p>After letting out a pathetic cry, the Withered Tree Warrior smashed down with his club. But the experienced assassin was prepared, dodging the attack like the wind. After that, he pounced forward, fast as lightning, inflicting a deep wound on the Withered Tree Warrior’s other foot.</p> <p>With a rumble, the Withered Tree Warrior lost its balance and fell to the ground, both its feet bleeding heavily. Fortunately, Yang Ling had fast reactions. He somersaulted through the air, not only preventing himself from being smashed flat by the Withered Tree Warrior, but also coincidentally avoiding another killing blow by the veiled assassin.</p> <p>After quickly recalling the heavily injured Withered Tree Warrior, Yang Ling summoned a Horned Bee Beast to do battle before clenching his teeth and escaping toward the forest nearby. Since he was facing such a terrifying assassin, escaping back to Wissen Town would only result in death. He might find a slim chance of survival if he managed to escape into the vast Terras Forest.</p> <p>The attacks of the Horned Bee Beast bought Yang Ling precious time. He managed to enter the vast Terras Forest before the veiled assassin caught up to him. Yang Ling summoned Horned Bee Beasts to cover the path behind him as he continued moving in the other direction. At the same time, he continuously consumed Blood Orbs of Magical Beasts and tried his best to circulate the Wizard Power within his body, in hopes of recovering as soon as possible.</p> <p>Against the speedy veiled assassin, Yang Ling knew that the slow Evil Eyes and Withered Tree Warriors would not be able to accomplish anything. Under normal circumstances, the fast Unicorn which was adept in both offense and defense would be Yang Ling’s best weapon against the veiled assassin. Unfortunately, he had only recovered a small portion of his Wizard Power, not enough to summon the Unicorn. Out of desperation, he had no choice but to summon his Horned Bee Beasts as cannon fodder.</p> <p>An average person would not be able to defend himself against the poisonous stingers of the Horned Bee Beasts. But to someone as experienced as the veiled assassin, a lone Horned Bee Beast was no cause for concern. After easily avoiding the poisonous stingers of the Horned Bee Beast, he only had to gently flick the sharp dagger in his hands to slice the Horned Bee Beast in two.</p> <p>Yang Ling was alarmed after losing a dozen of his Horned Bee Beasts. He clenched his teeth and charged forward. In order to protect himself from again falling for the assassin’s strange spell, Yang Ling changed his course from time to time. He made use of obstacles such as trees and rocks to narrowly avoid the attacks of the veiled assassin time and time again. Yang Ling was lucky that he could continuously summon Horned Bee Beasts for cover and buy some time at critical moments. Otherwise, he would have long been dead.</p> <p>Even though the Horned Bee Beasts he summoned were all killed in one blow, Yang Ling had no better idea. He could tame more Horned Bee Beasts in the forest if he ran out of them, but he would definitely die horribly if he were caught in a direct battle with the heaven-ranked assassin. The only thing comforting Yang Ling now was that the Wizard Power in his body was increasing and circulating more smoothly. If he could summon the powerful Unicorn, he would at least be able to free himself from the assassin who was in close pursuit of him, if not completely turn the situation around.</p> <p>Yang Ling was afraid, clenching his teeth as he charged forward frantically, but the veiled assassin was even more shocked. He was a heaven-ranked assassin, and he had never once made a mistake over all these years. He had not expected Yang Ling to be able to escape him while he was distracted for a moment. Also, the numbing spell that he had cast was of the highest level. He had never imagined that Yang Ling would regain movement so quickly.</p> <p>What frustrated the veiled assassin even more was that Yang Ling was continuously changing his course, his path of escape even more slippery than that of a fish. Every time he locked onto Yang Ling and was about to use his numbing spell, Yang Ling would dodge to the side, causing him to miss. Furthermore, every time he accelerated and charged forward, his path would be blocked by a Horned Bee Beast that appeared out of thin air. Even though he was not afraid of the Horned Bee Beast’s sharp fangs, he had to be on guard against their poisonous stingers. They allowed Yang Ling to avoid his sudden attacks by mere millimeters time and time again.</p> <p>Slowly, the amount of Wizard Power in Yang Ling’s body grew, and his speed increased as well. Yang Ling jumped from tree to tree like a large bird, while the assassin chasing behind him clenched his teeth in frustration.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling pick up speed, the veiled assassin clenched his teeth and drew a pitch black bow from his back. He nocked his last magic arrow. He released the arrow after taking aim at Yang Ling. He had paid a high price in order to kill the despicable Yang Ling; that last magic arrow had been obtained with much effort.</p> <p>Whoosh…</p> <p>Yang Ling was shocked when he heard the strange sounds made by the magic arrow. He dodged through the narrow crack between two trees. Unexpectedly, the weird magic arrow followed suit, swiveling through the air to continue its pursuit.</p> <p>A guided missile?</p> <p>Turning his head back to look at the strange magic arrow, Yang Ling was almost shocked out of his wits. He darted between the trees of the forest with all his stamina without thinking about anything else. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a strange valley.</p> <p>The valley was covered in weird trees that were blood red in color. Some of the trees had lush leaves, taller than ten story buildings. Others were barren, and only their trunks remained, standing as straight as electric poles. Blood-like sap seeped out of the trunks, painting an eerie scene. Within the valley, one could occasionally spot fist-sized red spiders, as well as sheets of spider webs larger than a mosquito net.</p> <p>Some of the webs caught bulldozer-sized rhinoceroses, while some had layers of bugs entangled within them. It was obvious that the webs were very strong. Using his recovered Wizard Power, Yang Ling nimbly darted sideways. He did not dare charge recklessly into the strange spider webs. He might have to wait for death if he got entangled by the web.</p> <p>After carefully avoiding the webs, Yang Ling had an idea. He made his way toward the area with the densest collection of spider webs. As expected, with the strong spider webs getting denser and denser, the guided missile-like magic arrow behind him slowed down more and more, giving him a glimmer of hope for survival.</p> <p>At the same time, seeing Yang Ling fleeing into the strange valley and the dense cluster of spider webs, the veiled assassin stopped in his tracks.</p> <p>“Let him go, we need not chase after him any longer!” Just as the veiled assassin was about to continue his pursuit, ripples appeared in the air. A black-robed elder appeared out of thin air, with Gulania by his side. “He entered the Spider Valley, there is no way he will survive. There’s no need to continue chasing after him!”</p> <p>“Sir, in order to ensure that the mission is complete, shouldn’t I continue after him?” The veiled assassin touched his chest with his right arm and bowed to the black-robed elder, his attitude respectful.</p> <p>“Hmph, you have missed the best opportunity. If he could really escape the Tarantula Valley, then that is his luck!” Looking at the female assassin Gulania who had repeatedly missed her opportunity, the black-robed elder let out a cold grunt, “We have a more pressing mission ahead of us. There’s no need to waste too much of our energy on this young man.”</p> <p>After muttering an incantation, a Six Pointed Star Teleportation Formation appeared beside the veiled elder. Before he left, he said coldly to the female assassin kneeling on the ground, “Gulania, as punishment for failing this many times, you are to receive training in Black Feather City from tomorrow onward!”</p> <p>Hearing the veiled elder say this, even the veiled assassin shuddered in fear, much less the female assassin Gulania. But meeting the elder’s cold gaze, neither of them dared to oppose his instructions.</p>",
  "Chapter 48: Red-haired Tarantula": "<p>After racing forward for some time, Yang Ling finally heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the strange magic arrow behind him had disappeared. He sat down and leaned back on a blood red tree with luscious leaves to catch his breath.</p> <p>After resting for some time, Yang Ling could still feel his skin crawl when he recalled the terrifying heaven-ranked assassin, his strange magic arrow, sharp dagger, and instantaneous numbing magic. If Yang Ling had hesitated even slightly, he would definitely have been sent to his grave.</p> <p>Perhaps he could only fight against the assassin after he advanced to the level of Earth Wizard and developed his Wizard Core?</p> <p>After witnessing the abilities of the veiled assassin, Yang Ling understood that he was still too weak. He might be able to win against an average swordsman or spellcaster by using his Magical Beasts in a surprise attack or through his numbers advantage… But against an expert fighter like a heaven-ranked assassin? Yang Ling would have no chance of victory unless he set up a meticulous ambush or allowed his Magical Beast army to take heavy casualties.</p> <p>In front of an expert, low level Magical Beasts such as the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts could only accomplish something if they numbered in the thousands; otherwise, they were merely cannon fodder. The level eight Unicorn was adept in offense and defense, but Yang Ling only had one under his control. What was even more unfortunate was the fact that he could not summon it if he did not have enough Wizard Power in his body. Yang Ling believed that against a powerful opponent, that would be his fatal weakness.</p> <p>Training hard and improving his abilities was the best course of action!</p> <p>Yang Ling took a deep breath, thinking hard about how he could obtain more Water from the Spring of Life and Magical Beast Blood Orbs. If he could gather enough Water from the Spring of Life and Magical Beast Blood Orbs, Yang Ling believed that he could quickly advance to the level of Earth Wizard and develop his Wizard Core. Only then, when he was in control of various mysterious wizard techniques, would he have the ability to face off against powerful fighters of this world, like the heaven-ranked assassins, Sword Saints, and Magical Tutors.</p> <p>Following a cool breeze, Yang Ling suddenly heard a strange rustling sound. At the same time, the pagoda-shaped seal on his forehead started to heat up. He had just stood up when he noticed that a large group of Red-haired Tarantulas had appeared around him.</p> <p>The Red-haired Tarantulas that appeared were of varying sizes, the smallest about the size of a thumb, while the bigger ones were the size of a fist. Their nine black eyes were arranged into three rows. Their legs were thick and strong, their abdomens covered with red hair and a brown pattern. Their legs were interlaced with gray and white bands. They bared their fangs as they surrounded the intruder who had infiltrated their valley. Their sharp, venomous fangs glinted with a cold light, making them look especially ferocious.</p> <p>Did I stumble into a den of spiders by accident?</p> <p>According to the memories of the Horned Bee Beasts, Yang Ling knew that these were low level Magical Beasts called Red-haired Tarantulas. They were equipped with a lethal poison, and they often appeared in swarms. Even mid level Magical Beasts like the Wind Wolf and Gold Thread Python did not dare offend these creatures, much less low level Magical Beasts like the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes.</p> <p>Escape was the best strategy!</p> <p>Looking at the swarms of Red-haired Tarantulas around him, Yang Ling swallowed hard. His Wizard Power had not completely recovered, and he was unable to summon a large number of Magical Beasts to aid him in battle. It would be wiser for him to leave as soon as possible.</p> <p>After coming to this conclusion, Yang Ling decided to climb up the tree behind him and flee for his life. But he could not help but gasp when he looked up. The tree above him was already covered with Red-haired Tarantulas, much to his shock. It looked like he had been surrounded by the horde of spiders when he was distracted just now.</p> <p>Without any path of escape, Yang Ling clenched his teeth, forcefully summoning three hundred Horned Bee Beasts and a hundred Evil Eyes to protect himself. He immediately sat down, cross-legged, hoping to recover his Wizard Power as soon as possible. Facing off against this group of excited spiders, he did not dare imagine his end if he did not have Wizard Power and was unable to summon Magical Beasts to aid him in battle.</p> <p>Screech…</p> <p>The horde of spiders slipped into disarray and let out weird cries when they saw the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes appear out of thin air. Some of them bared their fangs ferociously, some cautiously took half a step in retreat. Some even skittered around in unease, as if their instincts were warning them of danger.</p> <p>Before Yang Ling could catch his breath, an ear-piercing howl came suddenly from far away. Hearing that, the spiders fell silent, staring straight at Yang Ling who was protected by the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes. At the same time, more spiders emerged from the nearby bushes, stones, and fallen leaves, causing Yang Ling’s skin to crawl.</p> <p>I need to strike first!</p> <p>Seeing the dangerous situation, Yang Ling immediately ordered the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts to attack. The more Red-haired Tarantulas there were, the more of a disadvantage Yang Ling would be in.</p> <p>After a wave of blinding light, at the instant the spiders were closing their eyes tight, the Horned Bee Beasts charged forward like sonic jets, ready to attack. They first took care of the spiders on the tree in order to prevent any surprise attacks. After shooting out a wave of poisonous stingers, they pounced forward fiercely. With every movement of their sharp fangs, deep gashes appeared on the bodies of the spiders.</p> <p>After rapidly finishing off the spiders on the tree, the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts began their attacks on the horde of spiders on the ground under Yang Ling’s command. After the days that Yang Ling had spent training them, the cooperation between the two types of Magical Beasts was flawless.</p> <p>If the Evil Eyes were to be described as a cannon, then the speedy Horned Bee Beasts would be sharp daggers. The Evil Eyes would first launch a wave of wild explosions, crumbling the formation of their enemy before the Horned Bee Beasts swooped down to finish them off, cleaning up the enemies who were still trying to retaliate.</p> <p>Caught off guard, the Red-haired Tarantulas in front slipped into chaos. Some dug around in all directions, digging into the ground like earthworms. Some let out strange cries, as if calling for help from their partners nearby. There were even some who pounced forward with bared fangs, trying their best to retaliate by shooting out jets of yellow poison.</p> <p>The sticky yellow substance spat out by the red spiders was a lethal poison. If the Horned Bee Beasts hovering in the air were to accidentally come into contact with the substance, they would instantly be poisoned and fall helplessly to the ground before being torn to shreds by the poisonous fangs of the spiders. Luckily, the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts had attacked first, finishing off a large portion of the spiders in the front line. Otherwise, Yang Ling could not imagine how he would have dealt with the poisonous substance raining down on him.</p> <p>Even though he had gained the upper hand, Yang Ling did not dare be careless. There were too many Red-haired Tarantulas. He would have had the confidence to escape if his Wizard Power had recovered and he could summon his Magical Beasts to do battle for him. But at this moment, he would be happy if he could last until his Wizard Power recovered. If he was not able to summon more Magical Beasts to do battle before the Evil Eyes he summoned exhausted their magical powers, his end would leave a lot to be desired.</p> <p>Withdrawing the rest of his Magical Beast Blood Orbs from his Space Ring, Yang Ling took in a deep breath, then swallowed them one by one as he tried his best to circulate the Wizard Power in his body. Right now, time was of the essence. He hoped to be able to recover before the spiders launched a large scale counterattack.</p> <p>After a few flustered moments, there was an ear-piercing howl, and the nearest Red-haired Tarantulas all spat out their poison, trying their best to attack the Horned Bee Beasts that were flying closer to the ground. At the same time, a giant, pail-sized spider was crawling over quickly, guarded by a group of spiders. It let out loud screeches from time to time, commanding the horde of spiders to launch a large scale counterattack.</p> <p>The Spider King?</p> <p>Looking at the long hair and glinting poisonous fangs of the ferocious giant tarantula, Yang Ling cursed quietly. It was hard enough for him to deal with a group of tarantulas. How would he manage now that a commander-like Spider King had appeared?</p> <p>In his shock, Yang Ling immediately gathered a hundred Horned Bee Beasts and commanded them to focus their attacks on the Spider King that was out of range of the Evil Eyes’ attacks. To his dismay, the Horned Bee Beasts that were tasked with the surprise attack fell to the rain of poison when they had only made it halfway to the Spider King. There was no way for them to get close to the Spider King. It was as if they had encountered a cannon formation with a high firing rate.</p> <p>Without their poisonous stingers, a few Horned Bee beasts would not have the time to launch an effective attack even if they were lucky enough to get near to the Spider King. They would either be struck by the poisonous substance of the Spider King or be strangled to death by its thick web. Some would also be bitten, their bodies turning black as they died of the poison.</p> <p>D*mn it, I have to go all out!</p> <p>Consuming a handful of Magical Beast Blood Orbs, Yang Ling felt a shred of Wizard Power gathering in his body. Seeing the offensive of the Red-haired Tarantulas getting stronger under the command of the Spider King, Yang Ling understood that he would definitely die if this carried on. Clenching his teeth and looking at the Spider King that was approaching him, Yang Ling came up with a crazy plan.</p>",
  "Chapter 49: Spider Army": "<p>There were Red-haired Tarantulas baring their fangs all around Yang Ling. They were a horde, advancing from all directions like a tide. Yang Ling understood that with the limited amount of Wizard Power in his body, there was no way he could break through their ranks and escape. Unfortunately for him, he had gifted the Gryphon he tamed to Sofia. Otherwise, there would still be a chance that he could escape by air.</p> <p>Since he had no other options left, Yang Ling had decided to take a gamble. He clenched his teeth and summoned another hundred Evil Eyes. If he could catch the spiders off guard, he might be able to charge all the way to the Spider King. He was gambling on the chance that he could control the Red-haired Tarantulas around him if he successfully managed to tame the Spider King with his blood.</p> <p>There were too many spiders swarming forward. He would not have the time to tame all of them even if he were at full strength, much less now that the Wizard Power in his body was running on empty.</p> <p>Seeing the Spider King slowly approaching him, Yang Ling took a deep breath, then commanded the Evil Eyes to shoot out bolts of blinding light. He then charged toward the Spider King with the Horned Bee Beasts protecting him.</p> <p>Thirty steps, twenty-nine steps, twenty-eight steps…</p> <p>Seizing the instant when the Red-haired Tarantulas were caught off guard and had their eyes shut, Yang Ling charged forward without much consideration. There was only a thin line between victory and defeat. The outcome would be disastrous should he fail!</p> <p>After being hit by the blinding light released by the Evil Eyes, the spiders at the front felt as though coarse sand had been ground into their eyes. In that moment, it was difficult for them to even open their eyes, much less launch an attack. The terrifying giant Spider King was no exception.</p> <p>Also, there were too many spiders in the area. The spiders in front were panicking, skittering around in all directions like headless flies, while the smaller spiders at the back could not charge forward in time. The spiders in the front retreated while those at the back tried their best to advance, causing utter chaos.</p> <p>Eight steps, seven steps, six steps, five steps…</p> <p>When he heard the Spider King screeching incessantly with its eyes closed, Yang Ling found a ray of hope. He bit open his right index finger without hesitation. But just as he was about to allow the blood to fall, the ferocious Spider King seemed to sense imminent danger. It forcefully opened its eyes.</p> <p>Looking at the standing red hair and glinting poisonous fangs of the Spider King at close distance, Yang Ling couldn’t keep his skin from crawling. But there was no turning back now. Retreating would definitely lead to his death. All Yang Ling could do was clench his teeth and press forward.</p> <p>Just as the Spider King opened its mouth and was preparing to spew its poisonous substance, just as the horde of spiders were pouncing toward him, Yang Ling managed to press his bloodied finger onto the head of the Spider King.</p> <p>In that instant, the Spider King was rendered immobile. Multiple mysterious symbols covered its body, and it quickly vanished into thin air. Yang Ling felt all of the Blood Essence and Wizard Power in his body empty in that instant. He was exhausted, falling helplessly onto the ground. A foreign, ice cold, violent memory entered his brain.</p> <p>Forcefully forming a hand gesture, Yang Ling summoned the Spider King he had tamed. Yang Ling felt his consciousness become increasingly hazy. He had not managed to give any instructions when he slipped into a coma.</p> <p>Some time later, as a cold wind blew past, Yang Ling heard waves of mouse-like purrs. Opening his eyes to look around him, he realized that he was lying in a giant cave with a thick layer of silk-like spider web under his body.</p> <p>The cave was massive, its sides covered with multiple holes the size of trucks and filled with various foods. Some of the holes were incubating the eggs of the spiders. Near the holes, groups of Red-haired Tarantulas bustled around busily. The Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts defending his body were largely unharmed. The pail-sized Spider King was silently sprawled beside him like a hunting dog.</p> <p>Quickly, Yang Ling understood what had happened through the memories of the Spider King.</p> <p>After he had successfully tamed the Spider King, it quickly stopped the surrounding spiders from attacking him and seeing him as an enemy. When Yang Ling slipped into a coma and didn’t wake up, it ordered a large group of spiders to lay a thick layer of web under him, then they carefully dragged him into their nest.</p> <p>Intelligent. And powerful!</p> <p>Quickly, Yang Ling noticed that the Spider King was extraordinary. After being tamed, the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes would only listen to his orders and could not communicate between themselves. They could only learn to cooperate after a large amount of training. But the Spider King was different. It not only listened to Yang Ling’s orders after it was tamed, it had also managed to retain its control over the group of spiders.</p> <p>A Magical Beast that had absolute loyalty and was in control of an army?</p> <p>After the initial surprise, Yang Ling became incredibly excited. He saw a new path for his evolution. If the Evil Eyes, Horned Bee Beasts, and Withered Tree Warriors could evolve to become leaders like the Spider King, then he would be able to achieve complete freedom and only have to give commands on the macro scale. The abilities of the entire Magical Beast army would increase dramatically.</p> <p>Would an average spider listen to his or the Spider King’s commands after being tamed?</p> <p>In his joy, Yang Ling had a thought. He immediately grabbed a fist-sized spider and conducted an experiment. After taming it with a drop of blood, Yang Ling noticed that the spider followed both his and the Spider King’s commands. When there was a conflict between the two, the spider would follow his orders. It did not have any hesitation even when Yang Ling ordered it to bite the Spider King.</p> <p>Perfect, this is too perfect!</p> <p>Taking in a deep breath, Yang Ling tried his best to calm down. He knew that he had found the most optimal way to control the Magical Beast army. Taming the king of a type of Magical Beasts and using it to control the Magical Beast army, then taming its more notable subordinates.</p> <p>This way, he could not only fully utilize the battle capabilities of the Magical Beasts, he also didn’t need to worry about the Magical Beast army losing control. Even if the king were to be injured or killed, Yang Ling could command another exceptional Magical Beast to take its place, maintaining firm control over the entire Magical Beast army.</p> <p>From the memories of the Spider King, Yang Ling knew that the Spider Valley spanned hundreds of miles. There would be more spiders the deeper he went, and their abilities were also much more powerful. There were countless spider tribes within the valley, each having their own area to hunt in. Sometimes, in order to obtain territories or food, tribes would also engage in battles to the death.</p> <p>The law of the jungle?</p> <p>After understanding the general situation within Spider Valley, Yang Ling came up with another marvelous idea. His Wizard Power had recovered fully while he was asleep. He commanded the group of Magical Beasts to initiate attacks on other spider tribes, allowing the Spider King to expand its area of influence, but also allowing Yang Ling to test the abilities of the army he had just obtained. He might even be able to tame a few more Spider Kings, rapidly enhancing his own abilities. It was three birds with one stone.</p> <p>After deciding on his plan, Yang Ling immediately ordered the Spider King to gather its soldiers and prepare to raid the nearby spider tribes. Even though the memories of the Spider King told him that the nearby spider tribes were all very powerful, Yang Ling believed that now that his Wizard Power had recovered, he would be able to obtain complete victory if he summoned the Evil Eyes, Horned Bee Beasts, Withered Tree Guardians, and the Unicorn to aid him in battle. Even if he were to fail, Yang Ling was confident that he could escape.</p> <p>An extraordinary Spider King and a new way to command his army. Yang Ling had high hopes for the future. Perhaps he would be able to hold his own against powerhouses like heaven-ranked assassins and Sword Saints without having to advance to the level of Earth Wizard.</p>",
  "Chapter 50: Hunt": "<p>Yang Ling observed the nearby spider cave closely through the shrubbery. This was a tribe of Black Spiders. They were identical to the Red-haired Tarantulas other than the black hair covering their bodies.</p> <p>According to the memories of the Spider King, this was a relatively strong tribe with tens of thousands of spiders. As Yang Ling’s army drew close to the tribe, the Horned Bee Beasts had silently disposed of the scouts sent to patrol the area. Otherwise, there was no way that they could get near to their lair this easily.</p> <p>Even though the Red-haired Tarantulas were equipped with a lethal poison and possessed the ability to hide by digging into the ground, their prowess when it came to surprise attacks was incomparable to that of the speedy Horned Bee Beasts, especially the hundred Horned Bee Beasts who had evolved to develop angled wings.</p> <p>After developing angled wings, the Horned Bee Beasts’ movements became fast as lightning and nearly imperceptible. In the forest, under the cover of leaves, shrubs, and rocks, there was no way for the patrolling Black Spiders to notice them in time. When the scouts realized that something was off, it was already too late. They were unable to retaliate against the poisonous stingers and sharp fangs of the Horned Bee Beasts.</p> <p>The middle of the afternoon was usually when the Black Spiders were at their laziest. At this time, not many spiders would go out in search of food. Even the number of patrolling scouts were very small. Most of the spiders were either lying in their caves to rest or slowly consuming the prey they had stored in the cave. They were completely unaware of the tragedy that was about to befall them.</p> <p>After Yang Ling confirmed that they had dealt with the outermost guards of the Black Spiders, he hesitated no longer. He summoned all of his slow Evil Eyes and instructed them to get into formation. The tarantula army led by the Spider King dug into the barren land in front of the Evil Eyes. Their mission was to stop the Black Spiders from attacking the Evil Eyes. After the battle was finished, they would charge into the lair of the Black Spiders with the Horned Bee Beasts to clean up the remaining stragglers.</p> <p>After taking in a deep breath, Yang Ling issued the order to attack. In that moment, a rain of light beams shot straight into the wide cave of the Black Spiders. In that instant, pathetic cries spread from within the cave. Quickly, hordes of Black Spiders swarmed out of the cave like the tide, charging straight for the Evil Eyes not far away.</p> <p>Compared to the Red-haired Tarantulas, the Black Spiders were large and more muscular. Some of them were the size of a salad bowl, and they skittered out with their fangs bared. Unfortunately, in front of a large group of Evil Eyes in formation, their brittle exoskeletons did not stand a chance. They were reduced to mush by the beams of light the moment they charged out of the cave.</p> <p>Because of the lack of range, the devastating poison of the Black Spiders was completely ineffective. Most of them died near the entrance of the cave. The lucky few that managed to get near the Evil Eyes were quickly torn to shreds by the waiting Red-haired Tarantulas.</p> <p>Massacre, this was a clear massacre!</p> <p>The Black Spiders were unable to retaliate against the attacks of the large group of Red-haired Tarantulas and the continuous rain of beams of light released by the Evil Eyes. Quickly, the entrance to the cave was soaked in a river of blood, and a thick metallic stench of blood filled the air. Slowly, the pathetic cries from within the cave became weaker and weaker. The number of Black Spiders that charged out also became lesser.</p> <p>Sensing that the time was almost right, Yang Ling turned and ordered the Spider King to attack. The latter let out a howl, and in that instant, ferocious Red-haired Tarantulas emerged from the ground and swarmed toward the cave of the Black Spiders, their bloodlust soaring. At the same time, the Horned Bee Beasts also charged in like fighter jets, providing aerial support and cover for the spider army.</p> <p>The powers of the Evil Eyes were extraordinary in vast terrains, but they were rather ineffective for missions like clearing out a den. In narrow spaces and complicated terrains, their slow speed was a fatal weakness and would only render them living targets. After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling decided to recall them. He then carefully walked into the spider cave under the protection of a team of Horned Bee Beasts. Even though he had victory in hand, Yang Ling was still cautious of the spiders’ terrifying poison and their ability to tunnel into the ground.</p> <p>Stepping on the thick layer of blood and entering the cave, Yang Ling saw the Tarantula King instructing the spider army and raiding all corners of the cave, unwilling to miss any suspicious spots. Whenever they discovered a hidden Black Spider, a dozen Red-haired Tarantulas would pounce forward instantly, tearing it into pieces in the blink of an eye before consuming its remains.</p> <p>To an ordinary person, the poison and tunneling abilities of the Black Spiders might be difficult to defend against. But these were insignificant to the Red-haired Tarantula. A battle between spiders was mainly a competition of physical strength. It was a battle to see who had greater strength, whose poisonous fangs were sharper.</p> <p>Under the command of the Tarantula King, the spider army soon finished searching every nook and cranny of the cave, killing all of the Black Spiders that were hiding. They had annihilated the massive tribe of Black Spiders at the cost of a few hundred small tarantulas. The only regret Yang Ling had was that the body of the unlucky Black Spider King had been torn to shreds when he discovered it. His dream of taming the Black Spider King could no longer be fulfilled.</p> <p>Even though the Black Spider King had been torn into pieces, its brown Essence Crystal had been preserved. After seeking Yang Ling’s permission, the Tarantula King excitedly swallowed the Essence Crystal. Soon after, its body expanded, its glinting fangs becoming even sharper.</p> <p>Magical Beasts can voluntarily force evolution by consuming Essence Crystals?</p> <p>Seeing the Tarantula King grow from the size of a pail to the size of a bathtub, Yang Ling was elated. If the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts could also evolve this way, then he would be able to increase his abilities and train up an elite Magical Beast army within a short span of time.</p> <p>Following this, Yang Ling led his Magical Beast army and continued clearing the spider tribes nearby. He managed to tame five other Black Spider Kings with his blood. As for the Red-haired Tarantula King, it reached the size of a small calf after consuming a dozen Essence Crystals. The range of its poison had increased by twenty steps, and its offensive capabilities were terrifying. It had not only successfully seized control of the nearby territories, it now also had five more Black Spider Kings under its command.</p> <p>In order to heighten the agility and offensive capabilities of the spider army, Yang Ling picked out two thousand elite tarantulas with the help of the Tarantula King and tamed them all over the course of the day. Then, with the Tarantula King as the commander, Yang Ling selected five evolved tarantulas and the five Black Spider Kings to be leaders before dividing the two thousand tarantulas into ten large groups. He then proceeded to strengthen the cooperation between the tarantulas and the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts.</p> <p>The quality of the soldiers was more important than the quantity!</p> <p>After a few days of battle within Spider Valley, the results proved that a coordinated spider army was indeed more powerful. They displayed their abilities to shoot poison, spin webs, and tunnel into the ground far more exquisitely. At the same time, Yang Ling also discovered a secret. Low level Magical Beasts like the tarantulas, Horned Bee Beasts, and Evil Eyes could only consume Essence Crystals of the same species, while the Unicorn welcomed any crystal, seemingly able to consume the Essence Crystals of every Magical Beast.</p> <p>Even though the Terras Forest was said to span tens of thousands of miles, in actuality, no one truly knew how large this primordial forest was. No one knew how many low level Magical Beasts like the tarantulas, Horned Bee Beasts, and Evil Eyes there were in the forest. Yang Ling believed that given enough time, his army of low level Magical Beasts would one day evolve to reach a high level and become more powerful than mid level, or even high level, Magical Beasts that had not evolved.</p> <p>After leading his Magical Beast army and circling the Spider Valley for a few days, Yang Ling decided to leave the spider army within Spider Valley. In order to quickly advance to the level of Earth Wizard, Yang Ling needed a large amount of Water from the Spring of Life or Magical Beast Blood Orbs. Rather than keep his spider army in the Wizard’s Pagoda to train, he might as well get them to hunt for him. Even though the spider army was unable to condense Blood Orbs from the Magical Beasts, the spiders were capable of capturing Magical Beasts alive with their strong webs. All he had to do was come here regularly to collect them.</p> <p>After settling on the idea, Yang Ling left Spider Valley under the guard of his Horned Bee Beasts. He traveled quickly, jumping from tree to tree like a large bird. He led his Magical Beast army and hunted for a few days. He consumed a good number of Magical Beast Blood Essences and felt his Wizard Power increase even further. Perhaps he would be able to reach the mid levels of Spirit Wizard with just a little more effort.</p> <p>When he returned to the castle, Yang Ling instructed his trusted guard Argus to fetch Goode. He wanted to expand the range of the area that the guards were patrolling. Once bitten, twice shy. Even though the patrols would not be able to deal with experts like heaven-ranked assassins, they would be able to limit the activities of the scouts they sent and prevent them from easily obtaining information about his activities.</p> <p>Increase the area that the guards are patrolling?</p> <p>After understanding Yang Ling’s intentions, Goode was silent in deliberation. Increasing the range that the guards patrolled could not only guard against assassins or the survivors of the Anca family, it could also further prevent troops and adventurers from fighting with each other. But there were some difficulties when it came to really executing the idea.</p> <p>“Sir, increasing the range of patrol would have some great benefits. But in terms of funds, I am afraid…” Goode hesitated for a moment. There were both benefits and costs to expanding the scale of the patrol team. Without enough funds, the idea was mere talk.</p> <p>Even though the dwarf weapons shop and the Evening Primrose Bar were raking in decent profits every day, they did not have much left after using it on the few hundred people they employed in the castle and the restoration of the building itself. They were lucky that the barbarians only cared about having enough to eat and a place to stay. Yang Ling might be operating at a loss if they wanted wages like the rest of the people.</p> <p>“Goode, Wissen Town is rich in resources. We could set up our own merchant association that specializes in selling steel equipment, fine wine, and resources such as timber. How does that sound?”</p> <p>Set up their own merchant association?</p> <p>Goode’s eyes glinted, but he got a little dejected when he thought about the long distance and difficult mountain roads between Wissen Town and other human cities. “Sir, Wissen Town does have a lot of treasures, but unfortunately, its location is a little too out of the way. There are also many bandits along the way. The cost of transporting the resources would be exorbitantly expensive. It would be very hard to expect profits from trading in the short term!”</p> <p>“Hehe, it is indeed unprofitable if we sold normal items, but we would definitely obtain a large profit if we sold Magical Beast Essence Crystals!” Yang Ling smiled as he looked at the worried Goode.</p> <p>After a moment’s hesitation, Goode clapped his hands in admiration. The biggest reason for troops and adventurers coming to Wissen Town was because they had set their sights on the Magical Beast Essence Crystals in Terras Forest. An Essence Crystal from a low level Magical Beast might not be worth too much in Wissen Town, but it would definitely fetch an exorbitant price in the Banto Empire or the capital of the Rossi Empire.</p> <p>Compared to the troops and adventurers, Yang Ling possessed a unique advantage. As long as he set a reasonable price, the hunters wouldn’t sell the items to anyone else. Furthermore, Yang Ling basically had control of the largest hunting party in town. The forest elves and barbarians would cooperate with whatever he was doing. He would be able to gain much more if he factored in his terrifying Magical Beast army.</p> <p>Also, unlike selling heavy materials like steel ore and lumber, selling Essence Crystals only required a few horses, or even a mere teleportation scroll. It was simple and convenient! Goode became more excited as he thought about it, as if he could see the countless shining coins before him.</p> <p>Following this, Yang Ling sorted out a few details with Goode. He was prepared to pay a sum of money in advance to hire a hundred or so warriors who were at least at the level of swordsman to be lead by Casey. He also came up with a plan to set up the merchants association to sell Magical Beast Essence Crystals.</p> <p>That night, the townspeople saw groups of heavily armored warriors walking out of Wissen Castle. The townspeople felt an unprecedented sense of safety wherever the groups patrolled. The lazy troops and adventurers had no choice but to restrain their boorish acts of the past. After all, no one thought that the tire-sized axes in the hands of the barbarians were merely decoration. No one wanted to face a similar end as the Wind Troops.</p>",
  "Chapter 51: Wizard Formation": "<p>After increasing the radius and frequency of the patrols, the security in Wissen Town showed obvious improvement. But Yang Ling did not dare let his guard down. After all, the patrol troops could only deter an average person. They wouldn’t be very effective against experts like heaven-ranked assassins.</p> <p>Yang Ling could still feel his skin crawl whenever he thought back to the veiled assassin’s imperceptible movement techniques and instantaneous spells. Even though Yang Ling could summon his Magical Beasts very quickly, he was still too slow to fight an expert killer. If he had been matched up against the heaven-ranked assassin from the start, or if that female assassin Gulania had not bought him some time in her fury, Yang Ling would have died.</p> <p>After the ingredients had been prepared, Yang Ling decided to build a Wizard Maze Formation on the foundations of the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation. This way, even if his enemies were to successfully avoid the patrol troops and hidden spies, it would be difficult for them to get close to him secretly.</p> <p>The Wizard Maze Formation, true to its name, was a beginner level illusory formation. Those who barged into its radius without noticing the spell formation would lose their sense of direction and be unable to find their way out. Yang Ling was only a low level Spirit Wizard. If he were to advance to the level of Earth Wizard and gather his Wizard Core, he would be able to implement a killing formation on top of the Maze Formation, significantly boosting the power of formations.</p> <p>Yang Ling placed Magical Beast Essence Crystals at each point of the trigram. Experimentation had shown that Magical Beast Essence Crystals were on par with the crystals that were normally used to build formations. The effects were more obvious when Essence Crystals of high level Magical Beasts were used. For example, one Essence Crystal of the Nine-headed Snake Monster was much more powerful than a hundred crystals from Twin-headed Deer.</p> <p>During this period of time, given the substantial rewards that Yang Ling had offered, people had been sending over Blood Essence and Essence Crystals of various Magical Beasts. Even though most of them were either Blood Essences or the Essence Crystals of low level Magical Beasts, their quantity was enough to offset what they lacked in quality. Yang Ling believed that the Maze Formation would become his most effective protection, and that the heaven-ranked assassin would face some trouble dispelling it, even if he were to come after Yang Ling personally.</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged, Yang Ling circulated the Wizard Power in his body and activated the eight trigram formation he had prepared. With a low hum, the spell formation started to rotate slowly. It released a ring of seven-colored light, just like the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation when it was first activated. His body quickly absorbed the light.</p> <p>Yang Ling had guessed that the colored light arose because of the difference in energy and internal structures between Magical Beast Essence Crystals and regular crystals. This difference caused bursts of essence energy to well out of these crystals when he activated them using his Wizard Power. Essence Crystals of fire element Magical Beasts would release a red glow, those of earth element Magical Beasts would release a yellow glow, wood element Magical Beasts would release a green glow… After they overlapped with each other, they would form the rarely seen seven-colored glow.</p> <p>After absorbing the pure energy of the seven-colored glow, Yang Ling silently recited the Wizard Mantra and started to train. He did not notice Alice, who was delivering his meals to him, unintentionally stumbling into the yard where the Maze Formation was just set up.</p> <p>Taking a few steps forward with the food basket in hand, Alice noticed that the scene before her had changed, and she had suddenly arrived in a foreign place. Giant, sinister trees surrounded her, as if she had mysteriously been transported deep into the Terras Forest.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, where are you? Brother Yang…”</p> <p>Caught by surprise, Alice was shaken. She shouted in fear. She did not understand what this place was. She could not comprehend how she had arrived at this mysterious place even though she was walking into Yang Ling’s yard.</p> <p>After shouting for some time, seeing that there was no reaction, Alice relied on her wits and walked backward based on her intuition. But she could not make her way out of the sinister forest no matter how hard she tried. Tired out, Alice felt that the increasingly sinister forest was like a monster that devoured humans. She involuntarily became more and more fearful.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, Brother Yang…”</p> <p>A breeze blew past. Alice felt the chill penetrate her, as if some undead spirit was crawling out of the forest. In sudden fear, she clenched her teeth and sprinted, not thinking about anything else. She shouted Yang Ling’s name as she ran, her tears welling out like spring water.</p> <p>Sometime later, the sky turned darker. She could not see her fingers before her. The sinister wind seemed to become stronger, as if some spirit was chasing after her. Thinking back to the many rumors of ghost sightings around Wissen Tower, she could not help but shiver straight from her soul. She grew increasingly nervous as she ran, frequently tripping over the roots protruding out of the ground. She was soon bleeding from her many falls.</p> <p>Sometime later, just when Alice was about to break down, she suddenly felt that she had encountered a monster that was floating in the air. She screeched in shock. Her legs became limp as she fainted.</p> <p>“Alice, don’t be afraid, it’s me!” Seeing Alice pale from the fear, Yang Ling blamed himself for being careless and not notifying the people nearby before he set up the Maze Formation. It was lucky that he had not incorporated the killing formation; otherwise, the outcome would have been disastrous.</p> <p>After pressing hard on Alice’s philtrum, the pitiful lass slowly woke up. Seeing Yang Ling before her, she quickly pounced into his embrace and did not move. “Brother Yang, there’s a ghost, there’s a ghost…”</p> <p>“It’s alright, it’s alright. With your Brother Yang around, no ghosts would dare come out. Don’t be afraid!” Seeing Alice still shaken, Yang Ling shook his head with a bitter smile. He first consoled her, then patted her back lightly.</p> <p>After Yang Ling spent a great deal of effort to activate and deactivate the Maze Formation multiple times in front of Alice, the shaken girl slowly calmed down. She now believed that it was an illusion created by a mysterious spell formation. She did not understand how the Maze Formation worked, but she seemed to understand what it meant after Yang Ling told her that it was a mysterious spell formation.</p> <p>“Alice, don’t be afraid, this is only a spell formation!” Hugging the pitiful Alice, Yang Ling spoke gently as he stroked her hair. He cursed himself for being careless. It was lucky that he had not implemented the killing formation. Otherwise, since Alice did not possess spells or battle energy, she would have died in an instant.</p> <p>After the hours of torment, Alice’s cloak had gone missing. All she was wearing now was a thin blouse, and her perky breasts were faintly visible. Yang Ling unintentionally looked down and almost got a nose bleed. He naturally had a male reaction.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, I… I brought you food!”</p> <p>After Yang Ling explained the spell formation, Alice slowly calmed down. Even though she was still young, she knew a little about the differences between males and females. Her face was red with shame after she sensed the difference in Yang Ling’s lower body. She shyly freed herself from Yang Ling’s embrace.</p> <p>Brought me food?</p> <p>Seeing the empty basket in Alice’s arms, Yang Ling felt moved. Despite being scared silly, the girl had held onto the basket tightly. Unfortunately, even though the basket was present, the food within had disappeared.</p> <p>“Oh right. Alice, how’s your grandfather? Is he healthy?”</p> <p>“Yes, he’s doing well, and he talks about you often!” Alice replied softly, her face red. She did not dare raise her head to look at Yang Ling. She became very nervous every time she thought about the hardness below Yang Ling’s belt.</p> <p>Seeing how shy the girl had become, Yang Ling felt a little awkward. He didn’t know if it was because he hadn’t been around many women since he came to this world or if it was because of his massive improvements in Wizard Power, but his lower body now reacted instantly to any stimulus. When he was with Sofia a few days before, he had scared her off unintentionally. Now he was also making the girl before him uncomfortable.</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, looking at Alice’s skinny shoulders, Yang Ling said with a little pity, “Alice, your grandfather is too lonely living alone. From tomorrow onward, why don’t you return home to wait on your grandfather!”</p> <p>Return home to wait on my grandfather?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, Alice trembled. She quickly looked up and said, with tears welling in her eyes, “Brother Yang, I said that I would wait on you for my whole life. Am I not doing a good job? Why are you chasing me away?”</p> <p>Without waiting for Yang Ling to answer, Alice shyly continued, “Sister Giana said that I am of age now, and that I can marry. Brother Yang, if you… I…”</p> <p>What on earth? Hearing Alice say this, then looking at her undeveloped little breasts, Yang Ling let out a bitter smile. Where was this girl’s imagination taking her?</p> <p>“Alice, how could I bear to chase you away? I only want you to be able to take care of your grandfather!” Yang Ling hesitated for a moment, then continued, “Let’s do it this way; bring your grandfather to live with us. This way, you need not journey to and fro, and you two can take care of each other!”</p> <p>“Brother Yang, do you really mean it?” After a moment’s surprise, Alice smiled. Yang Ling wondered if all women were natural actors, their moods changing faster than the weather in June.</p> <p>“Of course. You can ask Murbaqi for a few servants to help you!”</p> <p>As Alice turned to leave in excitement, Yang Ling shook his head. He told her how to enter and exit the yard, just in case she could not find her way in the next time.</p>",
  "Chapter 52: Magical Beast Blood Amulets": "<p>Yang Ling did not reveal the way to enter and exit the Maze Formation to anyone other than Alice and Sofia, not even the tactician Goode. After all, the Maze Formation was his last and most reliable defense. Otherwise, if a heaven-ranked assassin managed to get near him while he was meditating, the outcome would be disastrous.</p> <p>Even though warriors were patrolling day and night, Wissen Castle was just too big. There was no way to keep every single corner under tight surveillance. Yang Ling believed that with the current abilities of the patrol team, even a Great Swordsman or Great Spellcaster could infiltrate the castle easily, much less a heaven-ranked assassin.</p> <p>Also, the Anca family had occupied Wissen Castle for many years. Who knew if they had dug any secret tunnels within the castle. Yang Ling would not be happy if someone crawled out from under his bed while he was sleeping in the middle of the night. But with the Maze Formation, everything was more secure. Any enemy that entered the radius of the formation would immediately be hypnotized by the illusory formation.</p> <p>The patrol team was not very effective against top-notch experts, but Yang Ling still expanded their patrol radius to cover the entire Wissen Town in hopes of making things more difficult for any enemy scouts and limiting their movements. However, he wasn’t foolish enough to entrust his safety to the low level warriors on the patrol team. In this dog-eat-dog world, the only option was to improve one’s abilities quickly.</p> <p>Advancing to the level of Spirit Wizard had allowed Yang Ling to set up a few simple spell formations, but it also gave him access to offensive and defensive capabilities through the use of amulets. Being a Spirit Wizard made him much more powerful than his previous rank of Blood Wizard, where he could only tame Magical Beasts using his Blood Essence.</p> <p>Wizard Amulets, as the name implied, were various amulets created using Red Sand, Goddess Clay, Blood Essence, and other unique ingredients. Creating them required a large amount of Wizard Power.</p> <p>For the time being, Yang Ling did not know where to find weird objects like Red Sand and Goddess Clay in this foreign world. He intended to create the amulets entirely out of Magical Beast Blood Essence. With the success of the Spirit Gathering Formation and Maze Formation, perhaps Wizard Amulets made purely out of Magical Beast Blood essence would produce unexpected results as well.</p> <p>After instructing Alice, Murbaqi, and the rest not to disturb him, Yang Ling closed himself off and started creating Wizard Amulets. In place of Red Sand and Goddess Clay, he was going to use Magical Beast Blood Essence; and instead of high-quality paper, Yang Ling was going to use the hides of various Magical Beasts. He was making do with what he had.</p> <p>Taking a large brush made of Wind Wolf fur in hand, Yang Ling gently dipped it into some well-mixed Magical Beast Blood Essence. He then drew a Palm Lightning Wizard Amulet onto a handkerchief-sized piece of hide.</p> <p>The low level Palm Lightning was the simplest amulet technique within the Wizard Mantra. It only required a small amount of Wizard Power to activate, and it would attract a bolt of lightning when used. It was easy to carry around, like a magical grenade.</p> <p>While the blood on the Palm Lightning Wizard Amulet was still drying, Yang Ling lightly touched it with his finger and cautiously injected a shred of Wizard Power into it. Quickly, a mysterious ripple spread from the hide. It slowly released streaks of light.</p> <p>Feeling a strange power quickly gathering in the air, Yang Ling tossed the amulet at a nearby tree. It rumbled, the sound it released was rather shocking. Unfortunately, the small tree, about the thickness of a thumb, remained undamaged. The lightning was more visual than it was useful.</p> <p>Oh Yiblis, is this just a prop for scaring people?</p> <p>Wizard Amulets were one-use items, and after being used, they shattered into fragments. Yang Ling couldn’t have found and analyzed the Lightning Amulet’s remains even if he wanted to. With no other choice, all he could do was draw another one. The outcome was rather depressing. His previous amulet might have scared someone, at least, but this one just made a fart-like noise.</p> <p>Unwilling to give up, Yang Ling drew another amulet. This one’s performance was even worse. Previously, even though he had been unsuccessful, the amulets still managed to make a sound. This amulet refused to show any reaction, no matter how much Wizard Power he infused into it.</p> <p>Three experiments and three different results. Yang Ling shook his head and laughed bitterly, thinking back to the chemistry experiments he did back when he was in high school.</p> <p>Back then, under the guidance of their teacher, anyone who was not a fool or mentally disabled could easily complete the experiment. The proportions of water and alcohol they were supposed to add were clear. Sometimes, the teacher would have prepared the entire experiment himself, and all that was left for them to do was to flick a switch or light a fire.</p> <p>This time around, there was no teacher. There was no Internet he could use to research questions. He did not even have the required materials. All he could do was slowly experiment and hope for the best.</p> <p>After many failures, Yang Ling looked at the large pail of well-mixed Magical Beast Blood Essence and shook his head. He could have made a hundred Blood Orbs with this much Blood Essence.</p> <p>Well-mixed?</p> <p>Suddenly, thinking of how many different Magical Beasts were represented by the soup of Blood Essence in the pail, Yang Ling had a thought. Without hesitation, he immediately took out a small bottle of Wind Wolf Blood Essence and carefully drew a simple Palm Lightning Wizard Amulet.</p> <p>After confirming that there were no mistakes, Yang Ling clenched his teeth and infused it with a shred of Wizard Power. In the blink of an eye, the beast hide released an incandescent silver glow. He barely managed to toss it away from him when it attracted a bolt of terrifying lighting, rumbling as it blasted the small tree into pieces.</p> <p>In his joy, Yang Ling continued using the Wind Wolf Blood Essence to draw several Wizard Amulets including Palm Lightning, Sky Blasting Cannons, and Dolphin Sonar. Without exception, all of them were resounding successes.</p> <p>Comparing the different Magical Beast Blood Essences, Yang Ling noticed that in ordinary cases, the power that the Wizard Amulet created would increase if the Blood Essence were from a higher level Magical Beast. But some Magical Beast Blood Essences would provide unexpected results when used for certain unique Wizard Amulets.</p> <p>For example, a Palm Lightning amulet created with Wind Wolf Blood Essence could sever a tree as thick as a pail, but a Palm Lightning amulet created using the Blood Essence of a Twin-headed Deer, also a low level Magical Beast, could completely destroy a tree of the same size.</p> <p>Similarly, Dolphin Sonar created using the Blood Essence of a Devouring Mouse could make an opponent dizzy, but Dolphin Sonar created using the Blood Essence of a Bugu Bird could directly attack the soul of an enemy using powerful soundwaves. A few barbarians passing by were almost reduced to idiots by the sudden onslaught of the Dolphin Sonar.</p> <p>After understanding the technique of creating Wizard Amulets, Yang Ling spared no effort in creating various Wizard Amulets. Until he advanced to the level of Earth Wizard, these Wizard Amulets were his best options for offense, and they could make the difference between living and dying in a fight. He meditated and rested whenever he felt tired, and he consumed Magical Beast Blood Orbs or absorbed spiritual energy in the yard whenever he ran low on Wizard Power. After five days, he had created a full five hundred various Wizard Amulets and finished all of the Magical Beast Blood Essence he had purchased with thousands of Purple Crystal Coins.</p> <p>Ten Purple Crystal Coins per Wizard Amulet?</p> <p>After making a brief calculation, Yang Ling shook his head. An ordinary person wouldn’t be able to afford this. Luckily, after having found the treasures accumulated by the Anca family over the generations, he had not only gathered a large number of art pieces and Magical Beast Essence Crystals, he had also found considerable stores of crystal coins. It would not be a problem for him to create tens of thousands of Wizard Amulets.</p> <p>At the same time, through the stele in the Wizard’s Pagoda, Yang Ling understood that the level of Blood Wizard was merely a foundation of cultivating wizard techniques. The level of Spirit Wizard was also merely an initial step in the journey. Only by cultivating to the level of Earth Wizard and developing the Wizard Core would he truly be on the path of cultivation.</p> <p>Even though the Wizard Amulets like Palm Lightning and Dolphin Sonar were powerful, they were merely low level Wizard Amulets compared to the mysterious wizard techniques. Only by breaking through to the level of Earth Wizard and gathering his Wizard Core could he created mid level to high level Wizard Amulets and take one step closer to the various mysterious and powerful wizard techniques.</p> <p>Wizard Core?</p> <p>Yang Ling was full of hope for the future. With the help of the forest elves and barbarians, with the many hunters and troops that came forward to trade with him, along with the spider army he left in the Terras Forest to hunt for him, Yang Ling believed that he would be able to obtain a large amount of Magical Beast Blood Essence. As long as he was determined in his cultivation, he would one day successfully advance to the level of Earth Wizard and gather the mysterious and powerful Wizard Core.</p>",
  "Chapter 53: Sapling of the Tree of Life": "<p>A large amount of Magical Beast Blood Essence and energy was needed to create Wizard Amulets. After some deliberation, Yang Ling decided to assign the task of regularly going to Spider Valley to collect Essence Crystals and Blood Essences of Magical Beasts to his trusted aide Argus.</p> <p>Over the days of observation, Yang Ling noticed that Argus was intelligent and knew what he should and shouldn’t say despite his young age. Even though his battle abilities were below average, only reaching the stage of a mid level Swordsman, he was very loyal. Argus was very grateful to Yang Ling for saving him. It was definitely worth Yang Ling’s time to nurture Argus.</p> <p>Perhaps I should allocate some time to researching the Battle Energy and spells of this world?</p> <p>Thinking back to the books on Battle Energy and spells within his Space Ring, Yang Ling started to come up with a plan. Even though he did not understand the exact nature of Battle Energy and spells, it was clear that they were rather powerful. Yang Ling’s energy was limited, which would make it difficult for him to study the Wizard Mantra, Battle Energy, and spells at the same time, but it would definitely be beneficial for him to better understand them.</p> <p>In order to stand his ground in this foreign world, he needed something more than just a powerful army of Magical Beasts; a strong group of human guards was also a must.</p> <p>After all, the Magical Beast army was not omnipotent. There were many times where a human would be required to solve a problem. Yang Ling could not send the Tarantula King or an Evil Eye when he needed to negotiate business with a group of merchants.</p> <p>The Wizard Mantra was the ability Yang Ling could rely on the most. He had not mentioned this even to Alice and Sofia, much less Argus. The Wizard Mantra, along with his background, was his greatest secret. Even if he wanted to talk about it, it would be difficult for him to explain it clearly within a short span of time.</p> <p>The Wizard Mantra couldn’t be passed down or revealed. That meant that the only way to strengthen Argus and the others under his command was through the Battle Energy and spells of this world. Yang Ling decided that when he had time, he was going to look into the manuals in his Space Ring with Goode, Sofia, and the rest.</p> <p>After he came to a decision, Yang Ling quickly announced that he was going to set up a team of personal guards with Argus as the leader. In order to keep it confidential, the rest of the ten members would be picked from the barbarians. Compared to ordinary human fighters, Yang Ling had more faith in the bloodthirsty, violent barbarians.</p> <p>After completing his preparations, Yang Ling led his personal guards toward Spider Valley under the guise of going out for a hunt. Along the way, seeing the edge of the Terras Forest drifting further and further away from them, Argus and the rest became increasingly nervous. Only Yang Ling felt relaxed and at home.</p> <p>Perhaps I should tame a few flying Magical Beasts to ferry Argus and the rest?</p> <p>Argus and the barbarians were not slow. But in Yang Ling’s eyes, their speed was not much faster than a snail’s.</p> <p>“Sir, according to the information provided by the scouts, there is a Spider Valley in front of us. We have to go around it!”</p> <p>After traversing the forest for about a day, seeing Yang Ling continue walking forward, Argus quickly gave him a reminder. A spider was not scary on its own, but against tens of thousands of spiders, even a Great Swordsman might have no choice but to go around the valley, much less a mere Swordsman like him.</p> <p>“It’s alright, we’ll have roasted spiders for dinner today!” Yang Ling gave a mysterious smile when he looked at the nervous Argus and the barbarians.</p> <p>Roasted spiders?</p> <p>Argus and the rest of the group turned to stone. They had heard of roasted wild boars and even roasted Eber Eagles, but they had never heard of anyone who would roast spiders. Disregarding the problem of actually capturing the spiders, it was a question if the poisonous spiders were edible or not.</p> <p>“Sir, spiders are edible?” Argus asked gently after a moment’s hesitation. He knew that Yang Ling’s abilities were deep beyond comprehension. Yang Ling might not have any problems capturing a few spiders within Spider Valley, but were the disgusting, poisonous spiders really edible?</p> <p>“Of course! Roasted, steamed, boiled, there are many ways of eating them. They are definitely a delicacy, very high in demand in the faraway desert countries!” Originally, Yang Ling had just meant it as a joke, but after seeing the shock of Argus and the group of barbarians, he decided to continue lying to them.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling walk forward on his Unicorn with large steps as he spoke, Argus could only lead his warriors and follow closely behind him. They heaved a sigh of relief when they approached the Spider Valley. The entrance of the valley was silent, without the horde of spiders they had imagined. Unexpectedly, spiders of various sizes swarmed out like the tide following Yang Ling’s whistle.</p> <p>“Protect Sir Yang Ling, quick!” Seeing the horde of spiders, seeing the calf-sized Spider King, Argus felt his skin crawl. He drew his sharp sword and instructed the barbarians to defend Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Haha, don’t be nervous, this is my spider army!” After a pause, Yang Ling jumped off the Unicorn and said, “They are also your partners in battle. In the future, you are going to have to interact more with this spider army!”</p> <p>Sir Yang Ling’s spider army?</p> <p>Seeing the calf-sized Tarantula King sprawled obediently before Yang Ling, then looking at the spiders covering the surrounding area, Argus and the rest wondered if they were dreaming. They could not come to their senses for the longest time.</p> <p>How terrifying is this Ancient Summoner?</p> <p>Argus was immensely shocked when he saw the horde of tarantulas. The barbarians that followed them here looked at each other, thinking that they were lucky for not having come into conflict with Yang Ling back at their tribe. Otherwise, the outcome would have been disastrous if Yang Ling had commanded the tide of spiders to swarm them.</p> <p>At Yang Ling’s instruction, the Tarantula King raised its hairy claw and scratched the bodies of the warriors, giving them a unique greeting. While Argus and the rest of the guards felt their skin crawl, they could finally believe that the horde of spiders before them was indeed under Yang Ling’s control.</p> <p>After resting in the Spider Valley for about four hours, Yang Ling and his group returned to the town with over thirty low level Magical Beast Essence Crystals and over a hundred bottles of Magical Beast Blood Essence. The corpses of the Magical Beasts were largely given to the spider army as a reward.</p> <p>After that, Argus would lead the personal guards to collect Magical Beast Essence Crystals and Blood Essence at Spider Valley once every three days. They would sometimes even bring back some fresh wild game. Because of Yang Ling’s order for confidentiality, no one knew where they hunted, and even more so, no one knew that Yang Ling had a massive spider army within Terras Forest.</p> <p>With a continuous source of Essence Crystals and Magical Beast Blood Essences, Yang Ling created a large number of Wizard Amulets. His speed of cultivation also increased. At the same time, Sofia also got very busy. She not only had to maintain communications between Yang Ling and the elf tribe, she also had to take part in managing the Evening Primrose Bar and even the operations of the refinery. But she felt that it was worth it no matter how tiring it was if she could be of help to Yang Ling. She was as happy as a carefree Bugu Bird.</p> <p>This day, after returning to Wissen Town from the elf tribe, Sofia joyfully went to look for Yang Ling who was testing the powers of his Wizard Amulets. “Brother Yang, guess what goodies I’ve brought for you this time?”</p> <p>“Hmm, so fragrant, you brought me a fragrant beauty!” Yang Ling gave a foolish act, taking in a deep breath beside Sofia. Perhaps it was due to having grown up in the forest and having a diet of various plants, female elves all had a faint refreshing scent surrounding them.</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling call her a fragrant beauty, Sofia blushed in shyness. But her heart felt a sense of sweetness, sweeter than when she ate a full can of pollen. “Brother Yang, look, what is this?”</p> <p>Sofia pulled open the cover of the flower basket as she spoke, carefully taking out a small sapling. “Brother Yang, this is a sapling of the Tree of Life that our tribe has successfully nurtured over the past few years. Grandfather said to give it to you as a gift. You have to take care of it well!”</p> <p>After Sofia explained a little more, Yang Ling understood how precious of a treasure the sapling was to the elf tribe. They might not even be able to nurture one in multiple decades. The sapling could evolve from a Tree of Life to an Ancient Tree of War, then to an Ancient Tree of Intelligence and Ancient Tree of Wind. When it was evolved to a high level, it could not only protect the tribes in the forest, it could also secrete Water from the Spring of Life. It was the source of power for the forest elves.</p>",
  "Chapter 54: Psychic Spell": "<p>After planting the sapling of the Tree of Life at the northeast corner of the yard, Sofia said, “Generally speaking, a sapling of the Tree of Life would take about a thousand years to evolve into an Ancient Tree of Intelligence. When that happens, we would be able to obtain a few drops of Water of the Spring of Life every day!”</p> <p>Yang Ling almost fainted when he heard Sofia. A thousand years? He would most likely have turned into a pile of mud before the sapling secreted any Water of the Spring of Life!</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, I won’t see it in my lifetime! Perhaps there’s a small chance that the great-great-grandson of my great-grandson will be able to witness it!” Yang Ling shook his head and let out a bitter smile as he looked at the weak sapling of the Tree of Life. Now, he finally realized why the Water of the Tree of Life was so rare, and why even the elf tribes valued it so highly.</p> <p>“An average person would have to wait at least a thousand years. That is also why many small elf tribes do not have any Water of the Spring of Life.” Seeing Yang Ling shake his head and sigh, Sofia continued, “But two days ago, when my grandfather was reading through some ancient documents of the elves, he found a shortcut…”</p> <p>Shortcut?</p> <p>Yang Ling’s eyes sparkled. There were many uses for the Water of the Spring of Life. It could not only accelerate his speed of cultivation, it could also hasten the evolution of Magical Beasts and neutralize the secret Crimson Pill of the Anca family. If he could quickly obtain a large amount of Water of the Spring of Life, it would benefit him greatly.</p> <p>After cautiously surveying the surroundings, Sofia carefully took out a thin piece of vellum from within her robes. Looking closely at it, Yang Ling saw that it was covered with small words. It looked like ancient Chinese characters at first glance, but when he looked at it closer, it felt a little different.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, my grandfather said that this is a psychic spell practiced by the ancient Tree Shepherds. Upon mastery of the spell, you would be able to communicate directly with plants and summon Withered Tree Warriors. You would also be able to boost the growth of plants. You have to hide it well!”</p> <p>After confirming that there was no one around them, Sofia patiently taught Yang Ling the ancient elven language on the vellum. According to the records, in ancient times, both Tree Shepherds and Forest Elves used the same ancient elven language and were closely connected. Even though not many could read the ancient elven language in this day and age, it still paid to be cautious.</p> <p>After studying the document for a while, even though Yang Ling could not figure out how he was going to cultivate the technique for the time being, he felt that describing it as a “spell” was misleading. Instead, it felt like a unique cultivating mantra.</p> <p>It was different from the Wizard Mantra, which required him to absorb spiritual energy from his surroundings. This mysterious psychic spell seemed to absorb the life force that was present in all of nature. But strangely, the circulation of this energy was rather similar to the Wizard Mantra, as if both techniques had some connection with each other.</p> <p>Could this be a special Wizard Mantra?</p> <p>After silently repeating the mysterious psychic spell a few times, Yang Ling had a thought. Tree Shepherds were able to summon a large number of Withered Tree Warriors. He himself could tame ancient trees with spiritual qualities using his blood. There was a possibility that the Tree Shepherds of ancient times were Wizards in this world. That would explain the many similarities.</p> <p>Could the Tree Shepherds of ancient times have something to do with how he had strangely arrived in this world?</p> <p>Yang Ling lost himself in thought as he considered many possibilities, and he only came to his senses when Sofia shouted at him.</p> <p>Yang Ling did not understand much. At the same time, seeing him quickly memorize the mantra and effortlessly recite it, Sofia was incredibly envious. The intonations of the ancient elven language would take an average forest elf more than ten days to remember, much less an average human.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, my grandfather said that this spell is incredibly mysterious and would perhaps benefit you greatly. He wants to spend some time looking into it!”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling deep in thought, Sofia felt a little awkward. In truth, she knew that helping Yang Ling rapidly improve his abilities wasn’t her grandfather’s only reason for handing the mysterious vellum to Yang Ling.</p> <p>After unintentionally discovering the spell practiced by the Tree Shepherds under their altar, her grandfather had gathered a few elders from the elf tribe. They were unable to decipher the secrets on the vellum, though; they could recognize every word, but nothing happened when they tried to cultivate the technique. In their frustration, all they could do was to pin their hopes on Yang Ling.</p> <p>It was rumored that in ancient times, the Tree Shepherds had a close relationship with the elves. Even if Yang Ling could not understand the vellum, the family behind him might be able to decipher the secret. As long as Yang Ling achieved the breakthrough and greatly improved his abilities, the elves would also receive benefits. At the very least, Yang Ling would be able to help them summon a few more powerful Withered Tree Warriors.</p> <p>“Alright, please thank the elf elders for me!”</p> <p>Yang Ling kept the mysterious vellum. Even though Sofia tried her best to hide it, the sharp Yang Ling could still detect that there was something hidden from him in this situation.</p> <p>But he didn’t believe that Sofia’s grandfather had any malicious intent toward him. At the very most, he probably hoped that Yang Ling would be better able to protect the elf tribe. After all, in the eyes of the elf elder, there was a powerful family of Ancient Summoners behind Yang Ling. If he could receive the aid of Yang Ling’s family, it would definitely be an immense help to the tribe of forest elves.</p> <p>It was a misunderstanding, a large misunderstanding!</p> <p>Yang Ling knew that the elves, barbarians, troops, and even the ordinary townspeople saw him as someone rich, born into a powerful family. But since the people thought of him that way, he was not going to contradict them. After all, this misunderstanding had brought him unexpected benefits. He would be truly foolish if he didn’t take advantage of this.</p> <p>After shelling a few crunchy hazelnuts for Yang Ling, Sofia bade her goodbyes, seeing that it was getting late. There were still many things to settle in the Evening Primrose Bar. According to their agreement with Yang Ling, the elf tribe would be able to obtain half the profit of every barrel of rum sold. Since the bar opened, the tribe had not only been able to improve the lives of its members, but also their weapons, much to the elation of her grandfather.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, tomorrow… I’ll come visit you again tomorrow!”</p> <p>Sofia couldn’t bear to leave. She had wanted to say a few more words, but seeing Yang Ling’s naughty smile, she could not help but recall the awkward situation in the bathroom. Her watery eyes glared at him as she turned to leave.</p> <p>After watching the elf beauty leave, Yang Ling continued his research on Wizard Amulets. It was already deep in the night, stars dotting the sky, when he went back to the yard to catch a breath of fresh air.</p> <p>Just as he was prepared to sit down and cultivate his Wizard Mantra, a pale green glow in the corner of the yard suddenly caught his eye. Walking over to take a look, he saw that the originally chopstick-sized sapling of the Tree of Life had already grown to the level of his knee. The speed of its growth was astonishing. And the spirit energy surrounding the sapling was even richer than the other plants in the yard, as if the sapling was absorbing the spirit energy on its own.</p> <p>It’s growing at rocket-like speed?</p> <p>In his confusion, Yang Ling decided to sit cross-legged beside the sapling of the Tree of Life and began to recite the mysterious psychic mantra. Quickly, the large trees around him started to release streaks of green life force. The life force mingled with the Wizard Power in his body, circulating in a mysterious path.</p> <p>At the same time, as the psychic spell activated, the trees around him started manically absorbing the rich spirit energy within the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation. The large trees absorbed the rich spiritual energy while Yang Ling absorbed the green life force released by the large trees, creating a win-win situation.</p> <p>From far away, the large trees in the yard seemed to sway without the wind. Even the many troops stationed at the edge of the Terras Forest could feel a massive amount of magical power suddenly gathering above Wissen Tower.</p> <p>Sometime later, Yang Ling felt a cool breeze blow past him. He slowly came to his senses. Opening his eyes, he saw that the sapling of the Tree of Life had grown to reach his waist, tender leaves sprouting from its branches. At the same time, the Wizard Power in his body was fused with a larger amount of green energy, as if his red veins had been enveloped by green vines.</p> <p>Even with his eyes closed, Yang Ling could clearly feel the movements of everything within the radius of a dozen steps. Every large tree in the yard, every root, even the maize that could be seen everywhere, seemed to have turned into his eyes and limbs.</p> <p>At this point, anybody who passed by the area would notice a pale green glow surrounding Yang Ling. From far away, he looked like a rock covered in algae, or a green tree trunk blending together with the plants in the yard.</p>",
  "Chapter 55: Green Mist": "<p>Early the next morning, Sofia carried a few of her homemade sponge cakes up to the castle so that Yang Ling could try some. But when she entered the yard and saw that the sapling of the Tree of Life had grown to waist-height overnight, she stopped in shock.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, this… What’s going on?” Sofia rubbed her large watery eyes in disbelief.</p> <p>“In order to obtain the Water of the Spring of Life as quickly as possible, I thought of a shortcut!” Looking at Sofia’s fair, tender face, Yang Ling revealed a mysterious smile.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling steal glances at her perky breasts, Sofia blushed in shyness. She said cheekily, “What are you looking at, hmm? Your eyeballs are about to fall out. Tell me, quickly, what is the shortcut?”</p> <p>A normal sapling of the Tree of Life would take a thousand years to mature, so this sapling was growing at an unimaginable rate. Sofia couldn’t understand how Yang Ling had managed to accelerate the growth of the sapling by several orders of magnitude.</p> <p>After picking up a delicious piece of sponge cake from Sofia’s flower basket, Yang Ling devoured it without hesitation. He put on an act and said, “Sigh, in order to obtain the Water of the Spring of Life as soon as possible, I spent the whole of last night pulling the stem of the sapling upward. After a full night’s work, I finally made it a few times longer. It was so tiring!”</p> <p>Pulling on the stem?</p> <p>After freezing for a moment, Sofia saw the faint traces of Yang Ling’s naughty smile and came to her senses. She angrily hit him on the chest several times. “Tell me what’s going on! If you don’t, I’m leaving!”</p> <p>Seeing Sofia about to leave, Yang Ling quickly grabbed her right hand. What Sofia did not expect was for Yang Ling to seize the opportunity and lay a gentle kiss on her earlobe. That electrifying feeling quickly spread throughout her body, causing her to go limp.</p> <p>“Sofia, have you noticed that the spiritual energy in this yard is especially rich?” Just as Sofia was blushing, Yang Ling changed the topic to something serious.</p> <p>Playfully glaring at Yang Ling, Sofia took in a deep breath. She tried her best to calm down and said, “I do not know what spiritual energy is, but the Magical Energy here is clearly several times greater than the outside world…”</p> <p>Could it be that the stronger the surrounding Magical Energy, the faster the sapling would grow?</p> <p>As she spoke, Sofia suddenly had an idea. The yard had rich Magical Energy, especially during the night, when the energy was so thick it looked like a layer of white fog. Since being in the yard could accelerate the speed of training, it could perhaps boost the growth of the sapling of the Tree of Life.</p> <p>After drinking the sweet spring water Sofia had brought down from the elf tribe, Yang Ling gave a satisfied burp and said, “That’s right. If my guess is correct, it was the thick spiritual energy, or Magical Energy, that boosted the sapling’s growth.”</p> <p>“Great, that’s great! I’ll tell my grandfather immediately and get him to notify the other elf tribes. Oh yes, Brother Yang, have you made any progress with the psychic spell?”</p> <p>Sofia was very excited. If they could greatly accelerate the sapling’s growth, the forest elves would be able to obtain more Water of the Spring of Life and increase the overall battle abilities of the tribes.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling told Sofia everything he had discovered. But strangely, no matter how hard Sofia tried, the large trees surrounding them did not move. On the other hand, all Yang Ling had to do was sit cross-legged and recite the mantra silently for the surroundings to be covered with rings of pale green life force.</p> <p>Sofia was anxious, and Yang Ling did not understand what was going on. They were using the same location and the same mantra, but no matter how hard Sofia tried, the large trees surrounding them remained unmoved.</p> <p>“Brother Yang, will you return to the elf tribe with me and try it with my grandfather?” After countless attempts, Sofia was drenched in sweat and had no choice but to give up.</p> <p>Deliberating for a moment, Yang Ling said, “Sofia, perhaps it’s because my yard is a little strange. Let’s split up. You can go back and test it with your grandfather, and I’ll try it within Terras Forest and see what kind of effect it has!”</p> <p>Yang Ling guessed that Sofia’s strange inability to use the mantra might be somehow due to the influence of the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation within the yard. In order to test this, Yang Ling had decided to head to Terras Forest, where the spiritual energy was thick, to conduct an experiment.</p> <p>Without wasting time, they bade their goodbyes and split up. Sofia rode the Gryphon that Yang Ling had tamed and quickly returned to the elf tribe, while Yang Ling headed straight for the vast Terras Forest.</p> <p>After days of training, absorbing spiritual energy, and soaking in the seven-colored light released by the various Magical Beast Essence Crystals, Yang Ling felt that his abilities had improved greatly. His speed and power were now a notch higher than they had been in the past. Jumping from one tree to the next required little to no effort, as if he was riding on clouds. He unconsciously moved further and further away from the edge of the forest.</p> <p>Even though it would have been faster to ride the Unicorn, Yang Ling was not willing to miss any chance to train. Ever since his narrow escape from the heaven-ranked assassin, he had realized that improving his abilities was the most important thing in this world. Otherwise, no matter how many Magical Beasts he controlled or how powerful they were, he might be killed before he could summon them to aid him in battle.</p> <p>It was dawn, and Terras Forest was covered with a layer of thick fog. After experiencing the female assassin Gulania’s sneak attack, Yang Ling did not dare be careless. He summoned all two thousand of his Horned Bee Beasts and split them into five teams. Leaving one team behind to act as his personal bodyguards, he sent the rest of the four teams to patrol the area within a two hundred step radius. He did not want to miss the slightest movements.</p> <p>A few hours later, Yang Ling arrived at a small lake, largely untrodden by humans. There were ancient trees all around him, the scenery green. A massive amount of spirit energy had gathered there.</p> <p>To ensure safety, he set up a simple Maze Formation near a large tree, then summoned his Evil Eyes, Withered Tree Warriors, and the Unicorn. He instructed the Magical Beast army to get into a formation and heavily guard the area. In order to prevent any Magical Beasts from suddenly charging up while he was training, Yang Ling sat cross-legged in the top of a tree after confirming that there were no high level Magical Beasts nearby.</p> <p>Even though the spiritual energy was richer in the deeper parts of Terras Forest, and his abilities were now much stronger than they had been in the past, Yang Ling was not willing to take unnecessary risks. Both the elf elder’s warning and the Unicorn’s memory told him that there were many terrifying Magical Beasts deep within the forest. Yang Ling did not want to act recklessly before he advanced to the level of Earth Wizard.</p> <p>There was a decent amount of spiritual energy around him. Even though it was not comparable to the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation he had set up in Wissen Tower’s yard, it was much better than any other location within Wissen Town. Yang Ling only needed to recite the psychic mantra once when he felt the trees around him releasing a blanketing life force. After the life force was absorbed, it melded with the red Wizard Power in his body before circulating around his body on a mysterious path.</p> <p>In the yard, a few large trees had already managed to release a large amount of life force. How much life force would be released in the parts of the Terras Forest which were largely unpolluted by humans?</p> <p>Feeling the increasingly rich life force, Yang Ling was incredibly excited about his training in the future! Even though he did not know exactly how to use the green energy for the time being, he knew that there would definitely be unexpected benefits after he absorbed a large amount of this energy.</p> <p>With the activation of the psychic spell, all the trees began manically absorbing the rich spiritual energy that had gathered in the forest before releasing a massive amount of life force. Even the lowly stumps on the ground and the ever-present maize were no exception, as they all released streaks of pale green vapor.</p> <p>Slowly, the massive life force formed a green fog, becoming increasingly thicker as it enveloped Yang Ling on the treetop. If Yang Ling opened his eyes now, he would have seen that tender leaves were emerging from the ancient trees around him. Even the ever-present grass on the ground was slowly becoming thicker and longer.</p> <p>The horde of Horned Bee Beasts once again underwent an evolution. Their skin slowly became green, and all of them developed angled wings. As for the hundred lucky Horned Bee Beasts, even though they did not evolve to the fourth level, the angled wings on their backs became more sturdy. At full speed, they were definitely much faster than they had been before.</p> <p>At the same time, the Evil Eyes also underwent some changes. The two tentacles on the sides of their bodies slowly became thicker. Each large, single eye alternated from red to dark green as they devoured the thick green energy.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes had visibly benefited from the energy, but their changes were minute compared to the Withered Tree Warriors that were tens of meters tall. The bodies of the Withered Tree Warriors swelled and contracted repeatedly in a cycle after absorbing the spiritual energy and green life force in the surroundings… Slowly, thick sharp spikes protruded from their shoulders, elbows, and knees. Their entire bodies were also covered with a thick layer of tree armor…</p>",
  "Chapter 56: Chaotic Battle between Magical Beasts": "<p>Sometime later, a green fog had expanded to a kilometer radius around Yang Ling. The green fog got thicker the closer it was to Yang Ling.</p> <p>Wild beasts discovered that their wounds would miraculously close and stop bleeding when they touched the green fog, and so they began to instinctively charge toward the area where the fog was thickest. Slowly, more and more wild beasts and Magical Beasts gathered in the area, all devouring the rarely-seen green mist.</p> <p>At the start, the beasts mostly ignored each other as they sought to consume the green mist as quickly as possible. Even natural enemies such as pythons and forest rats, Cloud Leopards and Twin-headed Deer, minded their own business. But the scene turned chaotic with the arrival of a group of Wind Wolves.</p> <p>Like Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts, Wind Wolves were Magical Beasts that moved together in packs, several hundred of them often appearing at the same time. They were also low level Magical Beasts, but their individual offensive and defensive capabilities were much more powerful than those of the Evil Eyes. The wolves were not only nimble and fast, they also possessed wind dagger spells.</p> <p>Seeing the hordes of Magical Beasts blocking their path, the leader of the wolf pack let out a howl before instructing the five hundred odd Wind Wolves under its command to scatter and howl as they moved. Experienced wild beasts knew that this was a prelude to an attack by the wolves. It was a threatening move frequently used by the wolf pack.</p> <p>After hesitating for a moment, a few lone wild beasts like the Twin-headed Deers and antelopes had no choice but to leave as they saw the pack of wolves slowly approaching them. Even though the green fog was immensely beneficial for their bodies, their lives were of more importance. Only a few powerful Magical Beasts and wild beasts that moved in packs refused to leave, counting on their numbers advantage.</p> <p>Aooo…</p> <p>Seeing that there were still several wild beasts blocking their way, the leader of the wolf pack finally lost its patience. It let out a long howl and led five hundred Wind Wolves to charge toward a group of Arrow Pigs.</p> <p>Even though Arrow Pigs were not Magical Beasts, they had sharp teeth and could shoot out the hard, sharp fur on their bodies when threatened. This, coupled with their massive numbers, made them rather powerful. If the Arrow Pigs were not the weakest of all the wild beasts present, the leader of the wolves wouldn’t have been willing to engage them in direct combat.</p> <p>Indeed, seeing the wolf pack pounce ferociously toward them, the Arrow Pigs were not willing to display weakness. They quickly got into a tight circular defensive formation and shot out their long fur following a long squeal from their leader.</p> <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p> <p>Following the sounds of the fur slicing through the air, the concentrated rain of arrows turned the dozens of Wind Wolves in front into porcupines. But with the distance closed, it was time for the Wind Wolves to display their might. They opened mouths full of sharp fangs and shot out sharp wind daggers, massacring the Arrow Pigs.</p> <p>Seeing that they were outmatched in close combat, the calf-sized leader of the Arrow Pigs let out a loud roar before leading dozens of muscular Arrow Pigs to charge forward, hoping to disrupt the Wind Wolves’ battle formation. But it was to no avail. They had not even got near to the Wind Wolves when their bodies were cut by the barrage of wind daggers. Following that, the leader of the wolves charged forward with a group of ferocious Wind Wolves, tearing the advancing Arrow Pigs into shreds in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>Seeing that they were no match for the wolves, the Arrow Pigs could only give up and try to escape. However, the Wind Wolves did not pursue the Arrow Pigs like they usually would have. In order to occupy an area where the green mist was thicker, they started to attack a group of Gold Thread Pythons not far away from Yang Ling.</p> <p>The body of each Gold Thread Python was thicker than a milk pail, and the longest of them was almost twenty meters in length. They had alternating black and white bands on their bodies, their backs adorned with a gold pattern. They not only had immense physical strength, they also possessed a lethal poison. Prey that they poisoned would turn black and be rendered unable to breathe in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>The Wind Wolves were unable to gain an advantage over the three hundred Gold Thread Pythons that were retaliating with all their might, even though the wolves outnumbered the snakes almost two-to-one. The wolves could avoid the poisonous fangs of the snakes, but they would often be flicked away by the snakes’ powerful tails. The two groups were evenly matched, with no clear victor. At the same time, the other Magical Beasts also tried to take advantage of the commotion and press forward.</p> <p>Unlike the average day, their wounds would slowly stop bleeding as long as the injury was not fatal. In fact, they could regain their stamina within a short span of time. Thus, some Magical Beasts were not afraid to launch attacks on the more powerful beasts blocking their way. Slowly, the battles became more and more chaotic.</p> <p>Buffeted by the roaring sounds of the massacre, Yang Ling slowly came to his senses. He opened his eyes to see the war around him, countless Magical Beasts fighting with each other like manic dogs. He was shocked, almost falling from the top of the tree.</p> <p>A great competition between Magical Beasts?</p> <p>Watching the crazed massacres unfolding outside the Maze Formation, Yang Ling could not help but feel his skin crawl. After observing coldly for a minute and seeing several weaker Magical Beasts hiding further away to devour the green fog, he gained a general understanding of why the Magical Beasts were slaughtering each other.</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was watching the spectacle of the Magical Beasts entwined in combat, a black cloud flew in suddenly from the horizon. It was immensely fast, arriving above the green fog in the blink of an eye. Looking at it, Yang Ling discovered that the black cloud was actually made up of a group of black Lightning Birds.</p> <p>According to the memories of the Unicorn, the Lightning Birds had great offensive capabilities and could release bolts of powerful purple lightning despite being level six Magical Beasts. Also, they often appeared in large groups. Even a Sword Saint would have to find another path when he encountered a large group of Lightning Birds.</p> <p>After circling around the thick green fog, the Lightning Birds quickly dove toward the Wind Wolves and Gold Thread Pythons on the ground. Yang Ling heaved a sigh of relief as he confirmed that his location had not been exposed for the time being.</p> <p>With a screech, the horde of Lightning Birds released bolts of thick lightning, electrifying several Wind Wolves and Gold Thread Pythons to a crisp. They then flashed forward, grabbing with their half-inch long sharp talons, digging out even the internal organs of their prey.</p> <p>In their frenzy, some Lightning Birds even carried their struggling prey into the air and split them apart with both their talons. Internal organs and fresh blood rained down onto the ground, creating a gory sight.</p> <p>The Lightning Birds not only attacked the Wind Wolves and Gold Thread Pythons, they even attacked the Short-legged Horses and the Komodo Cloud Leopards that were hiding in the thinner areas of the fog. It looked like they were prepared to monopolize this rare green fog. Understanding the motive of the Lightning Birds, the rest of the Magical Beasts were unwilling to back down, and they all joined forces to launch a counter attack. In that moment, the battle between the birds and the other Magical Beasts raged, their roars filling the air. Luckily, due to the effects of the Maze Formation, the Magical Beasts did not notice Yang Ling’s presence for the time being.</p> <p>In the chaotic battle, none of the Magical Beasts noticed that the green fog was slowly becoming dull since Yang Ling had stopped his training. The Lightning Birds and the various Magical Beasts let their bestial instincts take over, their eyes turning red as they fought to the death, as if forgetting their original aim of consuming the green fog.</p> <p>The Lightning Birds attacked fast and sharp while the alliance of Magical Beasts had the numbers advantage. Despite their insanity, the two parties were evenly matched!</p> <p>Even though the Lightning Birds were powerful, they were unable to gain a significant advantage against the wind daggers of the Wind Wolves, the poison of the Gold Thread Pythons, the exploding fireballs of the Komodo Cloud Leopards, etc. Instead, some of the weaker, yet rather intelligent beasts, secretly hid near the edge of the battle and consumed a good amount of the green fog. They started to leave silently when they noticed the green fog growing duller.</p> <p>Defeat on both sides?</p> <p>Seeing the increasingly injured group of Lightning Birds and Magical Beasts, Yang Ling had a thought. He recalled how he managed to luckily tame the Unicorn while it was heavily injured.</p>",
  "Chapter 57: Find Me a Few Beauties": "<p>Yang Ling had wanted to seize the opportunity to tame some of the injured Magical Beasts, but he had no choice but to give up on that thought when he saw the chaotic scene filled with the terrifying lightning of the Lightning Birds and fatal poison of the Gold Thread Pythons.</p> <p>Even though he could not tame them, he should be able to obtain a large number of Magical Beast Essence Crystals and Magical Beast Blood Essences! Yang Ling knew where to draw the line. As long as he had enough Magical Beast Blood Essence, he could accelerate the speed of his training. There were too many Magical Beasts engaging in this chaotic battle for him to risk charging out amongst them.</p> <p>Sometime later, the Lightning Birds gradually managed to gain the upper hand with their terrifying bolts of lightning and blinding speed. A few Magical Beasts noticed that the green mist was becoming duller and their wounds were recovering more slowly. They started to retreat.</p> <p>The first to retreat were the crafty Wind Wolves. With a long howl from their leader, the wolf pack abandoned nearly three hundred of their dead brethren and quickly evacuated the area. Following that, the Gold Thread Pythons and Komodo Cloud Leopards also reacted. Those who could move fled in a hurry. Slowly, more and more Magical Beasts started to retreat.</p> <p>As the Magical Beasts retreated in fear, the Lightning Birds did not chase after them. They had also suffered considerable losses during the battle. They took advantage of the remaining green mist and tried their best to recover from their injuries.</p> <p>Soon after, a cold breeze blew past, finally scattering the green mist. The Lightning Birds did not linger on the battlefield any longer. They circled a few times around the battlefield and left after letting out a few loud screeches. They disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>A pie, this was definitely a pie that fell from the sky!</p> <p>After watching the last of the Lightning Birds vanish from the horizon, Yang Ling wasted no time in instructing his Magical Beast army to clean up the battlefield. Originally, he had thought that he could seize the opportunity to tame a few injured Lightning Birds, Wind Wolves, or Gold Thread Pythons. But regrettably, most of the Magical Beasts that were still alive were also missing a limb. Taming them wouldn’t be worth the trouble.</p> <p>After sighing in regret, Yang Ling instructed his Magical Beast army to quickly finish the struggling Magical Beasts before storing their corpses in his Space Ring.</p> <p>An initial count told him that he had obtained the corpses of more than three hundred Wind Wolves, two hundred Gold Thread Pythons, and a hundred Lightning Birds. Other than that, he had also gathered more than three hundred corpses of various Magical Beasts. He had stumbled upon unexpected treasure. Not even counting the Essence Crystals in their bodies, the Blood Essence in the corpses was already worth an alarming sum.</p> <p>The Space Ring he picked up in Valenia Valley was rather wonderful, able to hold anything that was not living while preserving the item’s original state when retrieved. There was no need to worry that the Blood Essence in the corpses of the Magical Beasts would flow out and vanish if they were kept in the ring.</p> <p>Neigh…</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling had finished storing the corpses of the Magical Beasts and was preparing to scan the area to see if he had missed out on anything of value, the Unicorn suddenly neighed in unease. At the same time, an earth-shaking roar came from far away. The sound became increasingly louder, as if some top notch Magical Beast was approaching quickly.</p> <p>In his surprise, Yang Ling quickly recalled his Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts before leaving speedily on the Unicorn. If a Magical Beast could make even the Unicorn uneasy, then Yang Ling didn’t want to imagine how terrifying its battle abilities might be. He did not wish to run into a Magical Beast that was even more powerful than the Nine-headed Snake Monster.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>Yang Ling had just left when a furious roar came from the blood covered battlefield, as if some terrifying Magical Beast was feeling robbed for entering the action a little late.</p> <p>After hearing the furious roars of the Magical Beast, the Unicorn did not utter a sound as it moved its four legs, charging out of the edges of the forest as fast as a rocket. It looked like it was extremely cautious of the roaring Magical Beast.</p> <p>Maybe I’ll come back tomorrow?</p> <p>Originally, after obtaining such a great haul, Yang Ling was prepared to repeat this several more times. He wanted to use the psychic spell to stimulate the release of green mist from the trees, intentionally attracting the groups of Magical Beasts to do battle one another. It was like fishing with a net. But hearing the earth-shaking roars of the top notch Magical Beast, then looking at the frantically-fleeing Unicorn, he had no choice but to give up on such a tempting idea.</p> <p>No matter how good the benefits might be, he couldn’t reap the rewards if he was dead. He did not wish to invite trouble while he was fishing. This time, he had been lucky enough to run away before the top notch Magical Beast had arrived at the scene. Who knew what terrifying Magical Beast he might attract at the start of the next event?</p> <p>After quickly returning to Wissen Tower, Yang Ling took the corpses of the Magical Beasts out of his Space Ring, shocking the old butler Murbaqi, Casey, and the rest. No one had expected Yang Ling to be able to hunt this many Magical Beasts in a day.</p> <p>“Komodo Cloud Leopards, Wind Wolves, Gold Thread Pythons… Oh god, and so many Lightning Birds!”</p> <p>Digging through the Magical Beast corpses that had been piled on the ground, Casey was incredibly shocked. He rubbed his eyes and pinched hard on his thigh to make sure he wasn’t seeing things. Even a powerful Sword Saint or Magical Tutor could not hunt this many Magical Beasts in a day, much less a Great Swordsman. He could not understand how Yang Ling had accomplished the feat.</p> <p>Could it be that Yang Ling was hiding his abilities and possessed high level Magical Beasts that he had never shown the world?</p> <p>In their surprise, the men started coming up with theories. They thought about Yang Ling’s identity as an Ancient Summoner and Tree Shepherd. They recalled how even the terrifying Nine-headed Snake Demon was no match for Yang Ling. They were now more certain about their guesses.</p> <p>The men were shocked, but the hearts of the barbarians that crowded over shook. As locals who would make yearly deals with the Magical Beasts, they knew better than anyone how terrifying the Magical Beasts were, especially the black Lightning Birds; they were high level Magical Beasts that no average person could deal with.</p> <p>A few years ago, more than a hundred brave warriors from the tribe rallied to hunt in the deeper parts of the forest. Unfortunately, they encountered a few Lightning Birds. Other than one scout that luckily managed to escape alive, the rest of the brave warriors all fell in battle, yet Yang Ling had managed to effortlessly hunt this many Lightning Birds. The barbarians felt that they were lucky for not coming into conflict with Yang Ling when they first met him. Otherwise, their clan might have been exterminated by the large horde of Magical Beasts under his command.</p> <p>“Sir, did you kill all of these Magical Beasts?” Casey asked after a moment’s hesitation, unable to hold in his surprise.</p> <p>“No, I am not that powerful!” Looking at the dumbfounded Casey, Yang Ling let out a mysterious smile. “I went for a walk in Terras Forest to get some fresh air and happened to encounter a large group of Magical Beasts fighting each other. This was just a bargain I picked up!”</p> <p>He picked up this many Magical Beasts while just going for a stroll?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling’s explanation and looking at his mysterious smile, the crowd shook their heads. If something good like this could happen by coincidence, the hunters in Wissen Town would have all become millionaires. But since Yang Ling was unwilling to elaborate further, no one was clueless enough to continue asking. Even the reckless leader of the barbarians, Jarlock, was no exception.</p> <p>“Murbaqi, quickly get some men to storing the Blood Essence of the Magical Beasts. Don’t waste it!” After rubbing his blood-stained sleeve, Yang Ling gave a few more detailed instructions to the shocked old butler before leaving.</p> <p>Just as the crowd was still in shock, the tactician Goode quickly came to his senses. “Sir, the progress on the inn is smooth, and we will be able to start work soon. Do you want to head over to take a look?”</p> <p>“No need, you can settle that. You can make decisions on trivial matters on your own next time!” After they had come up with the overall plan, Yang Ling was not interested in wasting too much effort on the unimportant details. He patted his forehead and said, “Oh yes, Murbaqi, help me pick out twenty beautiful ladies with a good demeanor, then ask Sofia for ten tall and slender young elf ladies. I have an urgent use for them!”</p> <p>Pick out twenty beautiful ladies for urgent use?</p> <p>The shock came in waves! The crowd still had not come to their senses from the appearance of the enormous pile of Magical Beast corpses. They could not help but freeze when they heard Yang Ling’s words. The ladies had to not only be beautiful, but also have good demeanors. Could it be that Yang Ling was preparing to…</p> <p>As Harribell’s butler, Murbaqi had seen countless people of differing backgrounds, from chauvinistic nobles to bullies who would commit any evil deeds, but he had never seen someone as straightforward as Yang Ling. Others would be secretive about it when they were searching for a lover, but Yang Ling did not hold back on his words even in front of this many guards and servants.</p> <p>“This… I understand, the bar and winery are getting very busy, it is time to hire a few more helpers!” Murbaqi was quick on the uptake, rapidly finding an excuse for Yang Ling. He had hoped to help Yang Ling salvage his image in front of this many people.</p> <p>“Are the bar and winery that busy? Why haven’t I heard about it? I am going to have this batch of ladies focus on serving people!” Feeling that his cultivation level had improved greatly, Yang Ling wanted to hurry back to observe his abilities more closely. He had not picked up on the problems in his words just now. “Also, help me order a batch of dresses like this, with a split near the upper thigh!”</p> <p>Yang Ling nonchalantly drew a qipao-like dress and handed it to Murbaqi. Yang Ling did not worry about too many details when he had such a reliable old butler.</p> <p>Focus on serving people, tailored dresses, a slit near the upper thigh?</p> <p>The old butler was petrified, utterly speechless. He had tried his best to salvage the situation, fearing that there would be negative consequences, but Yang Ling had made himself crystal-clear.</p>",
  "Chapter 58: A Great Misunderstanding": "<p>Sitting cross-legged in the yard, Yang Ling noticed that the green energy in his body had become thicker and richer. If it were to be compared to a long green vine in the past, it was now a raging green river, completely fused with his blood red Wizard Energy.</p> <p>So the green life force can automatically heal injuries?</p> <p>Thinking back to the strange effects the green fog had on the Magical Beasts in the forest, Yang Ling had a thought. He doubtfully inflicted a small wound on his right hand. As expected, the wound stopped bleeding and quickly recovered.</p> <p>In his joy, Yang Ling tried to determine the extent of the differences brought about by the life force. He had only been cultivating for a short amount of time, but he felt that the Wizard Power was circulating faster than usual. He could more easily absorb the spiritual energy in the yard, making his cultivation even easier. At the same time, it did not require much effort to enter and exit the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda, as if his mental strength had also improved by leaps and bounds.</p> <p>Within the space of the Wizard’s Pagoda, the Withered Tree Warriors had transformed into large, tall trees, while the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts were greedily devouring the white fog released by the Wizard’s Pagoda.</p> <p>There was now a vast grassland within the space of the Wizard’s Pagoda. The snow-white Unicorn was playing with the little Unicorn on a field. When it saw Yang Ling, the little Unicorn ran over like the wind. Ever since Yang Ling had tamed this Unicorn, the adorable creature had been especially close to Yang Ling.</p> <p>After riding the Unicorn around the vast grassland, Yang Ling felt as though the space had expanded several times. Faintly, he felt that this was due to the green life force within his body. It was as if the stronger the green life force, the faster he could cultivate the Wizard Mantra, and with the rapid increase in his Wizard Power, the strange space that contained the Wizard’s Pagoda would become larger.</p> <p>“Sir, sir…”</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was prepared to more closely examine the space that contained the Wizard’s Pagoda, a faint sound approached him. He opened his eyes to see the old butler standing by the door, drenched in sweat.</p> <p>“Sir, the young ladies you need…” Murbaqi was a little hesitant.</p> <p>“Oh, what’s the matter? You can’t find enough?”</p> <p>After wiping the sweat off his forehead, Murbaqi said nervously, “No, sir, it’s not that I can’t find anyone, it’s that there are too many of them. They’re going to destroy the gates!”</p> <p>Destroy the gates?</p> <p>Yang Ling doubtfully shook his head. It was only after Murbaqi explained that he understood what was going on.</p> <p>After the news that Yang Ling was searching for beautiful ladies had spread, the entire population of Wissen Town had broken into a commotion. Yang Ling had money and power, and he was incredibly suave. He had long been the idol of many young ladies. They were more than willing to become Yang Ling’s lover without any status, or even his personal maid. Furthermore, Yang Ling had not married. A personal maid might someday become his true love.</p> <p>He was a bachelor, a very eligible bachelor!</p> <p>In the eyes of the townspeople, Yang Ling was born to a rich family. Marrying their daughter to him was akin to obtaining a well of fortune. The dowry itself would probably be enough to feed them for the rest of their lives. Thus, they had all brought their daughters to attend Yang Ling’s selection event.</p> <p>“Sir, perhaps… Is finding a beautiful personal maid for yourself in this manner a little too hasty?”</p> <p>Having served as a butler for a rich family for many years, Murbaqi was rather experienced. He felt that Yang Ling was disgracing his noble status by making such an unprepared selection. If he were to do things properly, he would set aside at least a month for the necessary preparations.</p> <p>Finding a beautiful personal maid for myself?</p> <p>Yang Ling almost fainted when he realized that the old butler had misunderstood his intentions. “Murbaqi, what are you talking about? The inn is about to open for business; I merely wanted to hire a few women for the service staff!”</p> <p>Female service staff for the inn?</p> <p>Murbaqi did not know what to think. This misunderstanding was unexpected, too unexpected. He had never thought about this possibility when he heard Yang Ling say in front of others that he wanted to choose some beautiful ladies to wait on people.</p> <p>“Sir, then… What are we going to do with the townspeople outside?” Thinking about the crowd of passionate townspeople, Murbaqi swallowed bitterly.</p> <p>“Deal with it at your discretion, and find me tonight after you gathered the candidates!”</p> <p>The power of the masses was terrifying. Yang Ling was not willing to subject himself to that kind of horror, so he fully intended to use Murbaqi as a shield.</p> <p>Yang Ling turned to leave. After shaking his head and letting out a bitter smile, the old butler hesitated for a moment and said, “Sir, there’s another matter. Miss Sofia, she…”</p> <p>“Oh, what happened to Sofia?”</p> <p>“Miss Sofia rushed over from the elf tribe early in the morning. When she heard that you were choosing… She, she cried and ran out on the spot!” This misunderstanding had gotten too big. Murbaqi felt a little dizzy. He steeled himself and said, “Fearing for her safety, I asked Casey to chase after her with a group of guards, but there’s been no news from them as of yet. We only found a note on the Gryphon!”</p> <p>The note Sofia left behind was simple, only containing a few words in her exquisite handwriting: “Yang Ling, I hate you.”</p> <p>“That silly girl!” Yang Ling summoned the Unicorn and leaped onto its back. “Murbaqi, organize search parties and look for Sofia’s whereabouts, quick!”</p> <p>He had not finished his sentence when he raced off. The townspeople blocking the gate only saw a white flash fly past their heads. They had not come to their senses when Yang Ling disappeared.</p> <p>Sofia did not have many friends in Wissen Town. She would not go anywhere other than Wissen Castle or the Evening Primrose Bar. Could she have headed straight back to the elf tribe in her sadness?</p> <p>Looking at the setting sun, Yang Ling creased his brows. It was late in the evening, and the Magical Beasts in Terras Forest would be in their most active state. Even a Great Swordsman would not dare barge into the forest at this time. With Sofia’s weak physical abilities, she would definitely be in danger if she encountered a ferocious Magical Beast.</p> <p>Without the Gryphon to carry her, Sofia would not be able to walk too far into the forest given her physical abilities. Thus, Yang Ling headed straight for the outer edges of the forest near Wissen Town. But after making a few rounds, he did not find any traces of Sofia. Instead, he encountered a few thief-like people acting suspiciously.</p> <p>“Brave warriors, have you seen an elf lady walking past this place?” Without any leads, all Yang Ling could do was ask the people before him. He might be able to obtain some information from them.</p> <p>“Oh, it’s you, Sir Yang. I am Argus’s cousin. My name is Arkas.” After being startled by Yang Ling’s sudden appearance, a young man with an olive green complexion reacted, taking the opportunity to make friends with Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Oh, what a coincidence!” Yang Ling forced a smile, then continued, “Arkas, did you see an elf lady walking past the area?”</p> <p>“Let me think…” Arkas deliberated for a moment before saying, “When I was taking a nap under a large tree in the afternoon, I heard a lady scream. When I walked over to take a look, I saw a beautiful elf with pointy ears crawling out of a pit. She cried as she ran into the forest, not knowing that she dropped her handkerchief. Could she be the person you are looking for?”</p> <p>Taking the handkerchief from Arkas’s hands, Yang Ling gave it a gentle sniff. There was a faint fragrance unique to Sofia on the handkerchief. He had gotten lucky and obtained some information!</p> <p>“Arkas, take your brothers to my butler, and he will give you some money as a reward!”</p> <p>After some formalities, Yang Ling quickly left on the Unicorn. It was much easier for him now that he knew the general direction Sofia had gone. At the same time, giving a few crystal coins to those unemployed bums was a way of giving his thanks. Those types of people were usually up to no good, but they often had good sources of information. He might be able to use them in the future.</p>",
  "Chapter 59: Wolf Horde": "<p>After riding the Unicorn for half the day, the sky was turning darker and there were still no traces of Sofia. Yang Ling could not help but feel more nervous. With Sofia’s physical weakness, there was no way that she could have gone far. Could some wild beast have…</p> <p>“Sofia, Sofia…” Anxious, Yang Ling called out loudly as he circled the forest on his Unicorn, fast as the wind. But other than the roars of reply from other wild beasts, he could not find any traces of Sofia. Instead, he attracted a few curious Arrow Pigs.</p> <p>“D*mn it, you’re asking for death!”</p> <p>Seeing the Arrow Pigs brazenly blocking his path, Yang Ling was furious. He lifted his hands and threw out several Palm Lighting Wizard Amulets, blasting the few hungry Arrow Pigs into mush.</p> <p>Even though he had easily dealt with the Arrow Pigs blocking his way, Yang Ling still summoned all of his Horned Bee Beasts to protect him as a form of precaution. Even though most Magical Beasts would avoid him after they sensed the powerful aura of the Unicorn, it was better to be more careful.</p> <p>Wait, are those… deerskin shoes?</p> <p>Yang Ling suddenly noticed a petite pair of deerskin shoes hidden underneath some lush shrubbery. He would never have noticed the shoes if not for the pink ribbon tied to them. Picking them up and taking a sniff, the shoes indeed carried a faint touch of Sofia’s unique fragrance. They also retained a little body heat, as if they had just been on her feet not long ago.</p> <p>That silly girl must have left this place not long ago!</p> <p>After carefully observing the tracks on the ground, Yang Ling quickly rode the Unicorn toward the northeast. Despite the stars in the sky and the bright moon, the forest was pitch black due to the cover of the trees. Luckily, Yang Ling’s vision had improved greatly after he had advanced to the level of Spirit Wizard, and he was riding on the Unicorn. An average person would have difficulty even walking around the many thorny bushes in the forest, much less tracking down someone else.</p> <p>Following the set of tracks on the ground and a few broken branches, Yang Ling chased after Sofia. He believed that Sofia could not have made too much progress under these conditions. Indeed, not long after, he detected a faint fragrance in the air, identical to the faint smell of Sofia’s body.</p> <p>After advancing to the level of Spirit Wizard, not only had Yang Ling’s Wizard Power and vision improved greatly, his sense of smell had improved drastically as well. In the past, the most he could do was differentiate between the scents of red and white wines, but now, he could discern the year of production of the wine with a mere sniff.</p> <p>After journeying forward a little more, the fragrance Sofia left behind became even more pronounced, but at the same time, there was the metallic stench of blood in the air. The metallic stench of blood became thicker the further Yang Ling walked forward.</p> <p>Could Sofia have…?</p> <p>In his shock, Yang Ling dug into the Unicorn’s belly and charged forward without hesitation. With Sofia’s weak physical abilities, the outcome would be disastrous if she encountered a hungry Magical Beast.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was fearful for Sofia’s safety, waves of wolf howls came from the area in front of him. Quickly rushing over to take a look, Yang Ling could not help but gasp. All he saw were several hundred hungry Wind Wolves surrounding and attacking a small mountain, roaring as they pounced forward.</p> <p>There were only three figures on the small mountain. One of them was prancing around on a muscular horse, while the other two seemed to be muttering something with staffs in their hands, continuously releasing various magical spells. With their cooperation, the Wind Wolves were unable to charge up the mountain for the time being.</p> <p>“Sofia, Sofia…” Seeing Sofia’s familiar figure on the mountain, Yang Ling heaved a sigh of relief, charging forward as he shouted.</p> <p>While charging forward, Yang Ling commanded the Unicorn and Horned Bee Beasts to attack. At the same time, he tossed out various Wizard Amulets like they were free. He opened a path of blood within the wolf horde as if he was riding a tank, successfully meeting up with Sofia atop the small mountain.</p> <p>“Yang Ling…” Seeing Yang Ling suddenly appear, the fatigued Sofia ran toward him without hesitation, tightly hugging Yang Ling who had jumped off the Unicorn.</p> <p>After fighting off a wave of attacks from the wolf horde with much effort, the knight wielding a long spear said angrily, “Hmph, even if you two want to show your affection for each other in public, do it after we fight off this horde of wolves!”</p> <p>Hearing the Knight of the Divine Palace tease her, Sofia’s face turned red in shame. Yang Ling let out a low grunt and quickly summoned his Magical Beast army. The Evil Eyes were the main attackers, while the Withered Tree Warriors and Horned Bee Beasts were responsible for defense. The Unicorn provided a constant threat. The massive Magical Beast army overcrowded the small mountain.</p> <p>Seeing the sudden appearance of a large group of Magical Beasts on the small mountain, the Wind Wolves could not react in time, unable to understand what was going on. After freezing for a moment, they only came to their senses with the howls of the leader of the pack. They manically charged forward, but it was too late. After a wave of blinding light, the Evil Eyes’ concentrated barrage of light rained onto them, instantly obliterating the leading wolves.</p> <p>Ever since the strange incident in the forest, even though the Evil Eyes had not evolved, their light bullets had increased in speed and become more accurate. The magical energy in their bodies had also become richer. In the past, they could release about twenty light bullets a day, but now they could fire fifty rounds, their offensive capabilities once again receiving an upgrade.</p> <p>The Wind Wolves were scary because of their lightning-fast speed, sharp teeth, and wind daggers. But against the Evil Eyes who were out of their attack range, there was no way for them to use their special abilities at all. They had no other ideas other than to charge forward maniacally. But facing Yang Ling’s Magical Beast army, it was hard for them to move even ten steps forward.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, the Evil Eyes only had to attack the Wind Wolves who were some distance away. Those charging forward would be dealt with by the Horned Bee Beasts and Withered Tree Warriors.</p> <p>After developing their angled wings, the two thousand Horned Bee Beasts were akin to high-speed fighter jets flying around in the air. They would either shoot out poisonous stingers that were hard to defend against or pounce forward to tear into the Wind Wolves charging toward them.</p> <p>The Wind Wolves had thick and sturdy skin. An ordinary wild beast would not be able to inflict fatal damage on them with one attack. But against the fierce attacks of the evolved Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts, the thick hides that the Wind Wolves prided themselves on were as weak as thin pieces of paper.</p>",
  "Chapter 60: Who’s the Most Disgusting Person": "<p>If the attacks of the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts were surprising, then the Withered Tree Warriors were alarming.</p> <p>Standing at dozens of meters tall, their muscles made out of towering rocks… What was even more terrifying were the spikes that protruded out of their various joints. With their every attack, they pierced through the bodies of the Wind Wolves like they were slicing tofu.</p> <p>They’re like humanoid murder weapons!</p> <p>Looking at the Withered Tree Warriors and the terrifying spikes that protruded from their joints, even Yang Ling himself was shocked, much less Sofia and the Knight of the Divine Palace Clause. Yang Ling had never expected these giants to be capable of evolving into such a terrifying state after absorbing a large amount of spiritual energy and life force in the forest.</p> <p>After the evolution, even though the Withered Tree Warriors lost their giant clubs, the terrifying spikes on their joints, their massive bodies, and their immense power made them weapons akin to heavy tanks. Yang Ling did not doubt that these Withered Tree Warriors would be able to destroy the Kevlar Heavy Tanks newly developed by the Americans with one punch.</p> <p>As they watched the terrifying offensive capabilities of the powerful Magical Beast army under Yang Ling, the Knight of the Divine Palace Clause and veiled Spellcaster Michelle were shocked beyond words. They thought of themselves as rather experienced, and even though they were able to fight off such a large group of hungry Wind Wolves, it had definitely not been as easy as Yang Ling was currently making it look. This was a massacre!</p> <p>Seeing the powerful attacks of the Evil Eyes, Horned Bee Beasts, and Withered Tree Warriors, then looking at the scattered Wind Wolves, Sofia and the Knight of the Divine Palace Clause stopped their attacks. Without thinking too much, they understood that this horde of Wind Wolves had been stopped in their tracks.</p> <p>After repeatedly trying to charge forward, the leader of the wolves saw that they were making no progress and instead incurring heavy casualties. He let out a long howl, prepared to lead the wolf horde in retreat. But the nightmare did not end. At Yang Ling’s command, the group of bloodthirsty Magical Beasts started a ferocious pursuit.</p> <p>The Evil Eyes were slow and rather ineffective when it came to chasing down enemies. But the speedy Horned Bee Beasts were like nightmares. No matter how fast the Wind Wolves ran, no matter where they hid, they were unable to avoid the persecution of the large group of Horned Bee Beasts. In this blood filled pursuit, the lightning fast speed, unavoidable poisonous stingers and sharp fangs of the Horned Bee Beasts were highlighted to the maximum.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts had glorious battle achievements, but the Withered Tree Warriors were even more terrifying. Under Yang Ling’s command, they rolled down the hill. Along the way, they bulldozed paths of blood, their sharp thorns slicing through the Wind Wolves like the scythe of the reaper.</p> <p>Seeing the precise attacks of the various Magical Beasts, both the Knight of the Divine Palace Clause and the veiled Spellcaster Michelle could not find anything to say. Even though they had both witnessed several large scale battles between knights, they had never seen such a ruthless Magical Beast army with such terrifying offensive capabilities.</p> <p>Just who was he, and which family was he born to?</p> <p>Looking at Yang Ling not far away, the veiled spellcaster Michelle was very confused. She had never seen a Summoner who could summon this many Magical Beasts, nor had she seen such powerful Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts. These low level Magical Beasts were everywhere in Terras Forest and were incredibly weak. No one could have expected them to have such a terrifying offensive capability in Yang Ling’s hands.</p> <p>Could he have hailed from the mysterious ancient Barkley or Sparkle families?</p> <p>Thinking back to the teachings of her mentor before she left for this journey, Michelle had a thought. She thought about the relatively unknown, yet powerful ancient families. Only they had such mysterious abilities, and only they could nurture such an exceptional descendent like Yang Ling. Otherwise, there was no way to explain how Yang Ling had such exceptional abilities despite his young age.</p> <p>Originally, Michelle had wanted to take the evil Snake Demon Blood Staff from Yang Ling in the name of the Church. But she had to reconsider that plan now that she was witnessing his powerful abilities. It might not be difficult to defeat Yang Ling himself if she gathered a few Spellcasters and knights from the Church, but she might invite unnecessary trouble if she were to anger the ancient family behind him.</p> <p>In her daze, Michelle did not notice Clause’s sharp gaze, as he enviously watched Yang Ling.</p> <p>With the combined attacks of the various Magical Beasts, the Wind Wolves were quickly obliterated. There were not many who were lucky enough to escape with their lives. All around them were twitching wolf corpses. Blood ran down the slopes of the hill around them, dying the entire mountain red.</p> <p>“You are Yang Ling, the Summoner who killed the Nine-headed Snake Monster?” Coming to her senses, Michelle asked the obvious question, taking the initiative in striking up a conversation.</p> <p>Turning back to see Michelle’s slim figure, long blonde hair, and clear gaze, Yang Ling could not help but steal another glance. Even though her face was covered with a veil, Yang Ling was sure that she was a beauty, a shockingly beautiful lady.</p> <p>“Hmph, what are you looking at? Why aren’t you quickly recalling the Magical Beasts that are consuming the corpses of the Wind Wolves? Don’t spoil our appetite!” Clause was unhappy that Yang Ling was staring at Michelle.</p> <p>“Hehe, I’m sorry for spoiling for your appetite. But I also feel disgusted when I see someone with eyes on the top of his head!” For some reason, Yang Ling felt uncomfortable when he saw Clause on his high horse.</p> <p>A person with eyes on the top of his head?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, Michelle broke into laughter while Clause turned green in anger. Clause had always been proud of his handsome looks and noble status. Before he joined the Church, he always had many beautiful ladies around him. But now, Yang Ling had called him disgusting!</p> <p>In his fury, Clause had wanted to give Yang Ling a harsh lesson. But he did not dare act recklessly after seeing the various Magical Beasts devouring the corpses of the Wind Wolves. He said fiercely, “Hmph, you can’t even protect your woman! What kind of man are you?”</p> <p>“You can ask your mother if I’m a man or not!” Yang Ling retorted without hesitation.</p> <p>“You…”</p> <p>Clause almost spat out blood in anger, clenching the long spear in his hand tightly. His expression changed. He clenched his teeth, wanting to turn Yang Ling into ashes where he stood.</p>",
  "Chapter 61: Do Not Test My Patience": "<p>Seeing Yang Ling and his cold smile, then looking at the agitated Clause, Michelle could not understand why they were acting like long-standing enemies despite having just met for the first time. She shook her head and said, “Sir Yang, thank you for your help today!”</p> <p>Mounting her tall white horse, Michelle waved at Yang Ling and Sofia before leaving. Seeing this, Clause could only follow after her. He turned back and shot Yang Ling an angry glare even as he left.</p> <p>A foolish playboy!</p> <p>The knight Clause had a deep hatred for Yang Ling, but Yang Ling did not care much about him.</p> <p>A person’s personality dictated his successes and failures. Even though this knight seemed powerful, able to fend off the attacks of a large group of Wind Wolves, his rash and impulsive personality would make it hard for him to make a name for himself. If their positions were switched, Yang Ling would definitely not wear his emotions on his sleeve like that. The man probably made enemies wherever he went. Instead, Yang Ling liked to plan how he was going to strike his enemies from behind.</p> <p>Distracted, Yang Ling only came to his senses after Sofia had walked some distance away.</p> <p>“Sofia, why did you run away without a word? Who bullied you? I will avenge you!” Yang Ling quickly caught up to Sofia and hugged her despite her struggles.</p> <p>“Release me! Why are you following me instead of finding beautiful maids and living your life as a Casanova?” Sofia struggled hard, her tears falling from her eyes. Early that morning, she had arrived at Wissen Castle with some sponge cakes she made herself. She hadn’t expected to hear news of Yang Ling conducting a selection for his personal maids.</p> <p>Originally, she didn’t see anything wrong with employing a few maids. But seeing how the townspeople hurried over with their dolled-up daughters, then hearing their discussions about which ladies from which families would be lucky enough to marry Yang Ling, she realized that the incident was not as simple as she had imagined. The nobles of the human race were as flirtatious as a Hasmere in heat.</p> <p>In her grief, Sofia became disheartened. She aimlessly ran into Terras Forest after leaving behind a note, and accidentally encountered a large group of hungry Wind Wolves. If not for Michelle and Clause passing by the area, she might have already met with misfortune.</p> <p>Find beautiful maids and live my life as a Casanova? Yang Ling shook his head. This misunderstanding has gone too far!</p> <p>“My elf lady, if you do not return, I am going to seriously consider finding myself a few beautiful ladies!” Yang Ling smiled. He quickly explained loudly after seeing the expression on Sofia’s face change. “Sofia, I only asked the butler to look for a few ladies to finalize the preparations for the inn that is going to open soon. A misunderstanding, this is all a misunderstanding!”</p> <p>“A misunderstanding? It might be reasonable that one person misunderstood, but could all of the people in Wissen Town have misunderstood?” Sofia’s face was covered in tears. She continued, “Yang Ling, let go of me! Let me return to the elf tribe alone. From this day on, I never want to see you again.”</p> <p>“Sofia, this is a rumor, a ridiculous rumor that originated because I did not explain myself clearly!” Yang Ling hugged the struggling Sofia tightly. “Even if I was thinking of that, why would I have asked for thirty ladies at the same time? Thirty people, I might not be able to cope even if I had cloning techniques!”</p> <p>Marrying thirty ladies at once?</p> <p>When Yang Ling said this, Sofia realized that the situation was a little off. With his explanation, she slowly noticed several suspicious spots in the story. Gradually, she started to believe that this was a rumor, a rumor that had caused her to slip into despair.</p> <p>After understanding what was going on, Sofia stopped struggling. Instead, she silently leaned in Yang Ling’s embrace. In her fatigue, leaning on Yang Ling’s broad chest and hearing his powerful heartbeats, Sofia felt an unprecedented sense of safety and satisfaction.</p> <p>When they returned to Wissen Castle, the fatigued Sofia had already fallen asleep in Yang Ling’s embrace. But even in her dreams, she would sometimes pitifully shed a few tears of sadness. Seeing this, Yang Ling gently carried her to his bed and carefully pulled a blanket over her. The pitiful girl must have been tired, having walked barefoot for such a long distance.</p> <p>Find a few beautiful maids and live the life of a Casanova?</p> <p>Thinking back to the misunderstanding of the people, Yang Ling shook his head. He sat cross-legged in the yard, preparing to train. But he had just sat down when the old butler Murbaqi arrived outside the yard. “Sir, the beautiful ladies have all been selected, if you would like to have a look…”</p> <p>“Oh, so fast?” Seeing Murbaqi’s bitter smile, Yang Ling understood that he must have been on the receiving end of many angry voices in order to explain the misunderstanding. “Murbaqi, this has been hard on you!”</p> <p>“This was within my duties, sir. You need not be too formal!” Seeing how Yang Ling cared for his subordinates, Murbaqi could not help but feel a little touched. A noble like this was rare. Only an ancient family with thousands of years of history could nurture a true noble like Yang Ling.</p> <p>Turning back to look at the sleeping Sofia, Yang Ling gently closed the door of the yard. “Murbaqi, let’s go! The inn is about to open for business, so we must quickly train a group of qualified servers!”</p> <p>Yang Ling knew that both the bar and the inn would require waitresses who could provide good service. Only by elevating the status of the inn could he capture the hearts of the merchants that came for holidays or work. Only then could he earn a bigger profit. Otherwise, if he was going to run an enterprise like an average roadside inn, he might not even be able to recoup his capital, much less make any money.</p> <p>When the twenty human ladies and ten elf ladies were standing before him, Yang Ling could not help but praise Murbaqi’s good tastes. These beautiful ladies were perky where they needed to be. If they were on Earth, they would definitely be loved by every man.</p> <p>“Ladies, do you know what you need to do?” Yang Ling smiled.</p> <p>“I know, we only need to do registration!”</p> <p>“That’s right, service in an inn, anyone knows how to do that.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Looking at the smiling Yang Ling, the ladies all started to speak, some even introducing themselves with the hopes of attracting his attention. If they obtained Yang Ling’s fancy, they might be able to turn into a phoenix overnight.</p> <p>After shaking his head, Yang Ling said, “Ladies, this job is not as simple as you think it is. You all have to start by learning how to smile and walk!”</p> <p>Learning how to walk?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, the ladies became petrified. Even the old butler at the side was no exception. All the ladies here were beautiful, all young and pretty, full of energy. Yang Ling wanted them to start by learning how to walk?</p> <p>Seeing the people dumbfounded, Yang Ling shook his head. He explained to them how to smile while revealing eight of their teeth and how to perform a tantalizing catwalk.</p> <p>Even though he had not done it himself, Yang Ling had seen many do it and knew the key points hotels used to train their staff. Under his meticulous training, the ladies slowly started to understand what he meant.</p> <p>“Sir, how’s my smile?”</p> <p>“Sir, is the position of my leg correct?”</p> <p>“Aiyo! Sir, quick, quick come and support my waist, I am about to fall!”</p> <p>Soon, with Yang Ling’s personal training, the ladies relaxed and made various poses. Yang Ling had touched them lightly as he corrected their postures and movements, and his nerves and patience were facing an unprecedented challenge.</p> <p>After the ladies changed into their red qipaos, seeing their curvaceous figures, slender waists, and fair thighs, Yang Ling could not help but feel thirsty. Fortunately, his self-control had improved drastically after absorbing a large amount of green life force, allowing him to barely withstand the ladies’ temptations. Otherwise, he would not have been able to maintain his composure, and he might have gotten a nosebleed.</p>",
  "Chapter 62: Shangri-La": "<p>With the free labor of the Wind Troops, the inexhaustible wood and stones, coupled with the experienced carpenters gathered by Murbaqi, the construction of the inn soon began.</p> <p>“Sir, now that the preparations are almost complete, what name do you think we should give the inn?” Goode looked excitedly at Yang Ling.</p> <p>Over this period of time, Goode had become filled with hope for the future. After drinking the Water of the Spring of Life, he had realized that not only had the poison that had been troubling him for years been dispelled, his magical energy had also increased considerably. At the same time, Yang Ling did not go back on his word. He had asked Harribell to use the powers of her family and the Boulade Merchant’s Alliance to quickly investigate the whereabouts of his family.</p> <p>Even though he was unable to save his family for the time being, Goode had seen how powerful Yang Ling was. He could even hunt Magical Beasts like Lightning Birds, Wind Wolves, and Gold Thread Pythons on his own. Coupled with the mysterious, powerful family backing him, Goode believed that with Yang Ling’s support, he would one day be able to save his suffering family members.</p> <p>To Goode, every crystal coin Yang Ling earned and every follower he gained was a success. The more powerful Yang Ling became, the greater the chances that he could save Goode’s family members. Thus, Goode voluntarily spent his efforts helping Yang Ling. According to the original plan, construction of the inn would take two months. But Goode had used the resources at his disposal to complete the task in a mere month.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling silent in deliberation, the old butler Murbaqi said, “How about calling it Wissen Inn? It’s simple and easy to remember!”</p> <p>“No, that is too simple. Call it Inn of the Battle God!” Yang Ling had not expressed his opinion when the dwarf Rumi loudly voiced his opinion, “Most of the foreigners that come to Wissen Town are troops and adventurers. Calling it Inn of the Battle God would definitely attract them!”</p> <p>Inn of the Battle God?</p> <p>Sofia creased her brows. “That’s too ridiculous. Why not call it Fantasy Inn, signifying that the inn is close to the fantasy-like, mysterious Terras Forest!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>In their excitement, everyone gave their opinions and engaged in heated discussion. The hot-tempered dwarf Rumi was red from arguing with the barbarian Jarlock.</p> <p>“There’s no need to argue anymore. Let’s call it Shangri-La!” Yang Ling paused, then continued, “There’s a paradise in my faraway homeland; its name is Shangri-La. There were many cows and sheep there, and the climate is pleasant. There were no wars, no disease, and the people lived peaceful lives. I hope that Wissen Town will become the Shangri-La of the Tailun Continent one day. I hope that our inn will be the most comfortable inn in the whole of the continent!”</p> <p>Paradise?</p> <p>Thinking about Wissen Town’s remote location and unique resources, then thinking about the vast Terras Forest and pure, simple townspeople, the group could not help but agree wholeheartedly with Yang Ling’s idea. As a forest-loving elf, Sofia even clapped in joy.</p> <p>After the preparations were complete, the Shangri-La Inn was open for business!</p> <p>With the thief Fenlist and soldier Gullit spreading the news, the inn’s unique style had been attracting attention since construction first began. The floor was paved with premium marble, the tables and chairs were made from purple sandalwood, the church-like circular roof, the peaceful, comfortable villas… All its features attracted the attention of the people.</p> <p>In Yang Ling’s plan, the front half of the inn was for ordinary troops and adventurers, and the room fees weren’t high. The main sources of profit would come from the villas at the back. Even though there weren’t many nobles who would come to Wissen Town for a holiday currently in the summer, they were all people who spent their money like water.</p> <p>Yang Ling believed that to a noble who was here on vacation or to hunt would not hesitate to pay a hundred Purple Crystal Coins a day for a comfortable inn that could highlight their status, much less twenty Purple Crystal Coins a day.</p> <p>The streets of Wissen Town were once again crowded when Shangri-La Inn opened for the first time, as everyone swarmed forward to be part of the action.</p> <p>“Tsk tsk, Shangri-La? Impressive! Nobles are indeed extraordinary; even the inns they build have so many gimmicks!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, a normal room costs ten Black Crystal Coins a day, that’s daylight robbery!”</p> <p>“You drunkard, what are you shouting for? Look at their marble floors, look at the tables and chairs made of purple sandalwood! A hundred Black Crystal Coins a day would be a reasonable price, much less ten. If you don’t want to stay here, you can go feed the mosquitoes outside. Don’t fight for a spot with me!”</p> <p>“That’s right! With such a comfortable inn in town, you’d have to be completely broke to stay outside and feed the mosquitoes!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The people were shocked when they saw the unique style of the inn, and they were now more certain that Yang Ling was born into a noble family. Otherwise, where would he get the capital to set up this many businesses? How could he employ this many experienced craftsmen? Where would he get this many styles that no one had seen or thought of before?</p> <p>The people were shocked when they looked at the luxurious Shangri-La, all engaging in discussion. They broke into a greater commotion when the beauties in the red qipaos slowly walked out from within the inn.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, brother, look, there are such fair, seductive thighs in this world!”</p> <p>“Tsk tsk, it would be even better if the slit went up a little more!”</p> <p>“Hehe, with beauties like this serving us, I am willing to stay here forever, much less a few days!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The beautiful figures, the slender waists, the blossoming smiles, and those fair, tempting thighs… The ladies in the qipaos captured the attention of the people the moment they walked out.</p> <p>The troops and adventurers had journeyed across the land, and many of them had seen inns more opulent than even palaces that cost hundreds of crystal coins a night. But no one had seen an inn with such a unique, comfortable style. They had seen exquisite beauties who claimed their youth would last forever. They had slept with wanton noble ladies. But no one had seen female servers with such a unique demeanor. Tempting, friendly, and a little reserved.</p> <p>Hearing the various discussions around him, Yang Ling felt that the time was right. He slowly walked out. “Ladies and gentlemen, today is the day our Shangri-La Inn opens for business. All our rooms will be on a fifty percent discount, and we will be providing the wine from our brewery for free. Please feel free to join us!”</p> <p>Fifty percent discount on all rooms, and free wine?</p> <p>The people once again broke into a commotion. The free wine was already worth it, much less this comfortable inn added onto it. After they first tried the fine rum and red wine produced by the Evening Primrose Bar, they felt that the alcohols they had consumed previously were all rubbish.</p> <p>“Because we have just opened for business, we are only opening a hundred normal rooms and ten villas. Those who want them should register early, as there will be no more available if you miss it!”</p> <p>Yang Ling looked nonchalant on the outside, but he was secretly calculating how many crystal coins he could earn in a day. He believed that business would be booming with this many alluring promotions. Indeed, he had just finished his words when the group of troops and adventurers swarmed forward, all pulling out their deposits, fearful that they would have to stay in their tents and feed the mosquitoes if they were too late.</p>",
  "Chapter 63: Tying of Benefits": "<p>The profits shocked them when they tabulated the accounts on the first night. Not only had the hundred ordinary rooms been completely filled, but even the ten villas were fully booked. After deducting the cost of manpower and the free wine, they earned a full five hundred Purple Crystal Coins.</p> <p>Five hundred Purple Crystal Coins in a day!</p> <p>To the rich of the Banto and Rossi Empires, five hundred Purple Crystal Coins in a day might seem like a negligible amount. But in a place as remote as Wissen Town, even five hundred Black Crystal Coins was seen as an immense profit, much less five hundred Purple Crystal Coins. After all, an average family’s monthly expenses weren’t more than a hundred Black Crystal Coins.</p> <p>Originally, the old butler Murbaqi did not approve of the idea of providing the alcohol for free. But he immediately got the brewery to deliver another batch of alcohol to the inn when he received a large sum of crystal coins that night. Murbaqi was more hardworking than anyone, and over the last month, he and Goode had spent a great deal of effort in maintaining a balance in the castle’s flow of cash.</p> <p>“Sir, if the business of the inn is this good, it’s best to expand the scale of the business immediately!” Seeing that the inn that he had spent so much effort in preparing was turning this much of a profit, Goode, who normally did not wear his expressions on his sleeve, was also smiling widely.</p> <p>“Yes yes yes, expand the scale of the business immediately. The bigger the better!” the old butler Murbaqi agreed loudly. According to the rule Yang Ling set for himself, he had to increase the pay of his subordinates and servants every year. If they could not think of ways to obtain larger profits, where would they find the money when the time came?</p> <p>Sofia, Casey, Rumi and the rest were in agreement with Murbaqi and Goode’s proposal, each of them advising Yang Ling to quickly expand the scale of Shangri-La.</p> <p>“Hehe, agreed, five hundred Purple Crystal Coins in a day isn’t worth mentioning!” Yang Ling gently shook his head after taking a sip of his jasmine tea. “Tell me, how can we consistently earn a large number of crystal coins?”</p> <p>“This…” Looking at Yang Ling’s imperceptible smile, Murbaqi was a little hesitant. Even though he had stayed in Harribell’s manor for many years, he was more adept in dealing with household affairs. Asking him to do business was stretching his expertise.</p> <p>After finishing the wine in his glass, the dwarf Rumi said loudly as he poured himself another glass, “That’s simple, isn’t it? Think of ways to get at the money that people have in their pockets, wouldn’t that be enough?”</p> <p>To Rumi, thinking deeper was simply a waste of time. Back when he was in the tribe, they only did simple transactions. When they ran out of money, they would just sell another batch of weapons.</p> <p>“Casey, what do you think?”</p> <p>“This…” Seeing Yang Ling question him, Casey rubbed the back of his head. He had a thought. “Sir, rally the people and hunt in the forest, then sell the hides and Essence Crystals of the Magical Beasts in large quantities. That way, we will be able to earn a large number of crystal coins every day!”</p> <p>“Yes yes yes, Terras Forest is rich in resources. We could be rolling in money just by selling the resources alone! We wouldn’t have to worry about our finances then!” Seeing the group voice their opinions, Alice also steeled her nerves and expressed her thoughts. Even though her family had opened a wood refinery in the past, they were not considered well-to-do. Not having to worry about food and clothing had been her greatest wish as a child.</p> <p>Shaking his head and seeing the tactician Goode sitting silently at the side,Yang Ling said, “Goode, tell us what you think!”</p> <p>Seeing the group turn to look at him, Goode deliberated for a moment before slowly saying, “Sir, Wissen Town is rich in resources. If we can ship them out, each of our specialties would earn us a large number of crystal coins. The key lies in transportation. If we can find a cheap and convenient way to transport the goods, then with Wissen Town’s unique conditions, we would have an endless stream of crystal coins!”</p> <p>A cheap and convenient way to transport the goods? Hearing Goode’s point, the group agreed after thinking for a moment. Only Yang Ling was still shaking his head.</p> <p>“Sir, what ideas do you have?” Seeing Yang Ling still shaking his head, the old butler became a little curious.</p> <p>Looking at the curious gazes of the group, Yang Ling gently took a sip of the refreshing jasmine tea and slowly told them a story.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the past, two merchants discovered two crystal mines respectively. One of the merchants employed a large number of vagrant workers with little wages to excavate the mine, and he prepared to leave after the excavation was finished. The wages he gave to the workers were so low that they could only barely afford to fill their stomachs. As a result, the turnover rate of the vagrant workers was high. Near the mine, the only places of entertainment were a casino and a brothel. There was nowhere else to spend their money, even if the workers wanted to.</p> <p>The other merchant also recruited a large number of vagrant workers, but he would raise their salaries once every fixed amount of time. At the same time, he worked hard to develop amenities such as bars, inns, and schools, allowing the vagrant workers to slowly start to live stable lives. At the same time, he could also turn a profit on his bars and hotels, which would then be invested into building other amenities.</p> <p>Five years later, when the mine dried up, the first merchant started looking elsewhere for opportunities, and the vagrant workers under him also left, leaving behind only a ravaged, barren land. In the second area, under the careful management of the merchant, the area surrounding the mine was not only still intact, but a bustling city with a steady stream of merchants had been set up beside the mine.</p> <p>Another five years later, the first merchant had nothing to do. He lost all his money in the casino and ended up on the streets. The latter merchant made the city even more bustling, not only earning a large amount of profit, but also establishing a good reputation for himself amongst the commoners. He was then conferred the title of Earl by the king.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After finishing his story, Yang Ling once again gently took a sip of the jasmine tea in his cup. Goode, Sofia, and Murbaqi were deep in thought, while the others looked at Yang Ling blankly, as if they could not wrap their heads around the story and were unable to understand what the story truly meant.</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, the old butler Murbaqi said in excitement, “I understand, sir, you mean to throw a long line to catch Gossfish. To first let the citizens of Wissen Town live comfortable lives and boost economic activity, then earn a larger number of crystal coins!”</p> <p>“That’s right. Terras Forest is the mine in the story. Wissen Town is our headquarters. If the townspeople here cannot afford to eat well, then there would be no way that we could earn large profits. What we would be doing would definitely be small in scale!” Yang Ling nodded in approval as he looked at the excited Murbaqi. “Thus, there is no need to expand the ordinary rooms of Shangri-La Inn. Let the rest of the people earn from the customers we cannot entertain!”</p> <p>“When the citizens of Wissen Town have more disposable income, then we can start building other facilities to boost the development of Wissen Town one step at a time. That way we can continuously earn more crystal coins!” After a moment’s hesitation, the intelligent Sofia also stated her opinion.</p> <p>“Yes, one step at a time! What we need is the continuous ability to turn a profit. From a certain angle, it is as Murbaqi says; throwing a long line to catch Gossfish!” Yang Ling praised the elf beauty beside him.</p> <p>There were countless tall trees in the Terras Forest which spanned tens of thousands of miles, and Magical Beasts teeming at every spot. In the eyes of others, this place was incredibly dangerous. But to Yang Ling, it was a place of unparalleled safety. Wissen Town, which was near Terras Forest, was basically his headquarters.</p> <p>The most secure way to get someone to work for you was not to give them a lump sum of crystal coins, but to give them a share of the pie, tying them tightly to his own chariot. That way, they would profit together, but also share a loss together!</p> <p>Unlike the rest of the people who were anxious to expand Shangri-La’s scale, Yang Ling was clear of the fact that setting up various amenities here would not only help him earn money, but more importantly, it would slowly form a symbiotic, friendly relationship of mutual benefit with the townspeople. Only that way could he truly have a stable standing in this town. Only by having a stable standing here could he quickly probe into the mysteries of this world, enjoy his new life, and search for any ways to return to the original Earth.</p> <p>Of course, earning money was not the most important thing, but he could not afford to not earn any money!</p> <p>Shangri-La was branded from the start as a mid to high tier inn. An ordinary room could not turn much of a profit in a day, and its main point was to attract a flow of customers. The truly profitable portion of the inn was the villas at the back. He could consider building a few more of those.</p> <p>Wissen Town was rich with resources, but it was definitely impossible to earn a monstrous profit just by selling the resources alone. Yang Ling understood that only by building large scale refineries of various kinds and setting up merchant associations to sell the finished products could he continuously turn a good profit.</p> <p>At the same time, obtaining capital meant that he could continuously increase the wages of his servants and subordinates and improve their standards of living and spending ability. Only with a disposable income would they increase their spending, and that would attract merchants seeking profit. At that point, he could set up more refineries and entertainment facilities to obtain even more crystal coins. Investments, obtaining capital, and reinvestments. A cycle like this would slowly boost Wissen Town’s economy.</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, Yang Ling simplified and told everyone his ideas. After a moment’s surprise, his inner circle was in agreement, once again solidifying their impression that Yang Ling must be from a rich family. Even the experienced old butler Murbaqi was no exception, instinctively thinking about the intelligent and far-sighted Miss Harribell.</p> <p>Yang Ling was young. There was no way that he could have thought that deep and far. The only explanation was that he was like Miss Harribell, learning this way of doing things from his family since he was young, and being taught by a famous teacher.</p> <p>Yang Ling convinced them. Only Yang Ling knew that what he said was the theoretical way of doing things. There would be many complications when he set out to truly accomplish the feat, given his incomplete theories and lack of experience. He would face troubles that he could not even think of at the time being.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, do you mean that our pay will increase soon?” After deliberating for a moment, the rest of the people basically understood Yang Ling’s point. Only the slightly drunk dwarf Rumi was still a little confused.</p> <p>“Hehe, increasing your pay is no problem, but you would have to pay for the wine you drink in the future!” Yang Ling shook his head when he looked at Rumi, who viewed alcohol as his life.</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, Rumi quickly hugged his barrel of wine tightly. “Forget it, there’s no need to increase my pay. We are brothers, talking about money would only hurt our relationship!”</p> <p>Looking at the nervous Rumi, the group broke into laughter. They were all hopeful for the future after having heard Yang Ling’s intentions. The tactician Goode was even more convinced by Yang Ling’s foresight. He knew that with Yang Ling’s help, he would one day be able to save his family members. He believed that with Yang Ling’s improving abilities, that day was not far away. Perhaps he could even fight back against the villain that had framed him all those years ago.</p>",
  "Chapter 64: Conflict at the Bar": "<p>Yang Ling could refuse the normal customers that did not give him much of a profit, but he could not miss the bigger transactions. Yang Ling instructed Goode to build twenty more villas. Basically, the profit he could obtain from one villa was more than if he rented out a hundred normal rooms.</p> <p>Just as the street lights were turning on, Yang Ling walked slowly toward the Evening Primrose Bar. Even though there was no KTV, nor was there any rock music, he could still find a shred of the feeling he used to have when he visited bars with his friends back in his world. The crowded bar, the dull lights, fine wine that could not be finished, and those beauties that would tempt him…</p> <p>After taking a corner, Yang Ling saw a person sadly wiping doors and windows. Looking over, Yang Ling realized that it was Andrew, the boss of the bar who had invited him to stay in Wissen Town originally.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, business in a bar would be the best at the time after dinner, but Andrew’s bar was silent, except for a couple that was flirting in the corner. Andrew’s customers had long ago been poached by the Evening Primrose Bar. Looking at the middle-aged, haggard Andrew, Yang Ling understood that he must have had a hard time recently. Thinking back to how straightforward and passionate Andrew had been in the past, Yang Ling suddenly had a thought.</p> <p>“Andrew, to think that you are still so hardworking at night!”</p> <p>“Oh, it’s you, Sir Yang!” Lifting his head and looking at Yang Ling, Andrew was very surprised. “I am getting fatter recently, haha! I should be more active, otherwise, mold will grow on my bones!”</p> <p>Getting fatter? Seeing Andrew’s haggard expression and streaks of white hair, Yang Ling smiled. “Big boss Andrew, you are not letting me into your bar! Are you worried that I have no money and will cheat you of your alcohol? I have always missed your topnotch bartending skills!”</p> <p>“Oh, look at how forgetful I am, pardon me, this way please!” Andrew let out an embarrassed smile, wiping his wet hands on his apron as he tilted his body to allow Yang Ling to enter. He then poured Yang Ling a glass of wine.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling’s Evening Primrose Bar had snatched away most of his customers, Andrew did not harbor too much hatred toward Yang Ling. After all, Yang Ling had helped the people eradicate the evil Anca family and had frequently helped the poorer townspeople. Yang Ling’s reputation had grown, and Andrew could only blame himself for not being as good as Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Ah, it tastes great!” Yang Ling deliberated for a moment after taking a sip of the wine. He was prepared to go straight to the point. “Andrew, how busy have you been recently? Are you interested in doing business?”</p> <p>Doing business? Andrew was surprised. He had thought that Yang Ling was merely here to reminisce about old times. He had not expected Yang Ling to discuss business with him. After the surprise, he could not help but feel excited. After all, he was talking to Yang Ling; the man would never speak of something he was not confident about. Any business Yang Ling wished to discuss would definitely be something worth doing.</p> <p>Indeed, after Yang Ling told him that he would invest in Andrew building up a giant hotel, Andrew became so excited that he stuttered. The success of the Shangri-La Inn was evident to all. Even though many would have liked to share a slice of that pie, how could an average person scrape together that much capital?</p> <p>“Sir Yang, I…” After his excitement, Andrew thought about his waning savings and became a little depressed. “Sir, the investment needed for the hotel is too big. Sigh, I would not be able to gather such a large amount of crystal coins even if you were to break my old bones!”</p> <p>“Money is of no problem, you can leave that to me! Do up the specific calculations to see how many crystal coins you will need, then come and look for me.” Yang Ling smiled. “But my interest rate is very high. After the hotel is built, you will have to make sure to manage it well. If you do not return my money, be careful that I will hound you for your debt!”</p> <p>After patting Andrew’s shoulders, Yang Ling left with large steps. Behind him, the middle-aged Andrew’s eyes were red with gratitude.</p> <p>With the waning business of his bar, he could almost no longer afford any food for his family. He was considering if he should close down his bar and go gathering wood with his neighbor for money. He had not expected Yang Ling to help him when he was at his lowest point, not only proposing a business plan, but also promising that he would provide a large amount of money as an advance payment. As for the words about the high interest, any person who was not a fool would understand that Yang Ling was only joking.</p> <p>Noble, he was a true noble, a true noble who was rich, generous, and had a good upbringing!</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s back receding into the dark town, Andrew was so touched that tears welled in his eyes. He decided to immediately return home to discuss the proposition with his wife. In the future, he would pray for Yang Ling’s life to be peaceful and blissful every time he prayed to the heavens. In times like this, nobles like Yang Ling who would treat commoners as equals were basically extinct.</p> <p>Andrew had tears in his eyes. At the same time, Yang Ling started to have many thoughts.</p> <p>Perhaps I could set up a money lending firm here!</p> <p>Thinking back to Andrew’s depressed look when he was poor, Yang Ling felt that setting up a money lending firm here would not be a bad choice. Firstly, he could earn quite a sum of crystal coins. Secondly, he could support and encourage the townspeople to invest and set up new businesses, more rapidly boosting the economy of Wissen Town. But more importantly, he could lay the foundation for firmly controlling the core of Wissen Town’s economy in the future.</p> <p>Even though he had not graduated with a degree in economics, even though he had spent most of his time in college chasing after girls and playing games, Yang Ling still knew how important banks were to the economy. If he were to set up a bank here, he might not be able to earn much in the short term, but there would definitely be great benefits for him in the long term.</p> <p>After thinking about it for some time, Yang Ling strolled to the Evening Primrose Bar. Unsurprisingly, the bar was already filled with people. There were troops laughing loudly, as though no one was around them. There were wood gatherers and hunters who viewed alcohol as their lives. There were also socialites dressed in revealing clothes.</p> <p>“Boss, this way please!” Upon seeing Yang Ling, the two elf ladies at the door quickly welcomed him in. The troops also opened a path for him. In Wissen Town, if there was a person that could make them respectful and fearful at the same time, it was Yang Ling.</p> <p>There were many female servers in the Evening Primrose. Both the human and elf ladies were captivating, but no one dared to act indecently toward them.</p> <p>To be able to uproot the deeply rooted Anca family, to be able to wipe out the obnoxious Wind Troops, who would dare offend this tiger? No one in town would have the gall to lay a hand on the ladies under Yang Ling, unless they were tired of living.</p> <p>Leaning on the high chair used exclusively for the bar table, Yang Ling took a sip of a high-quality Raphael Red Wine. In that moment, his body felt refreshed and energized.</p> <p>“John, have you come up with any new wine recently?” After closing his eyes and resting for a moment, Yang Ling asked the busy bartender beside him.</p> <p>The bartender called John was very young, but he was said to be a royal bartender who had served the royal family of the Banto Empire. Yang Ling had secretly tested him over several occasions and found that this lad possessed real skills. He could mix drinks with unique flavor profiles using merely ordinary rum and cedar wine. If not for having offended a high ranking official in the Banto Empire, he might not work here no matter how high of a salary Yang Ling offered him.</p> <p>“Sir, come back in a few days. Then, I’ll treat you to the most delicious cocktail in the continent!” John smiled apologetically at Yang Ling as he shook the mixing glass in his hands. With the movement of his wrist, the cocktail in the glass moved like a brown dragon in the sea.</p> <p>Looking at the not-so-humble bartender, Yang Ling smiled as he took a sip of his wine. Bartending was an art. Ordinarily, a person who was playing with art would often be a little eccentric, some thinking highly of themselves while others preferred to remain silent. He had seen many people like that when he was out with his friends in the past.</p> <p>After taking a sip of the cocktail John handed to him, Yang Ling had not had the opportunity to savor the different tastes of the drink when a dull thud suddenly came from the door. Following that, people started to shout loudly, “Oh Yiblis, you yellow haired wastrel from the Banto Empire, you dare intentionally block the way! You’re looking for death!”</p> <p>After a pathetic cry, a raspy voice came from outside the door, “Hehe, you stupid bear from the Rossi Empire, are you tired of living? Let’s see if your bone is harder than my dagger is sharp!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Following the fierce shouts, the sounds of a fight spread from outside the door. Slowly, both parties called upon their friends, and more troops and adventurers joined the fray. The area outside the bar was in chaos, and traces of blood could be found everywhere.</p> <p>Is this what a street fight looks like in this world?</p> <p>Shifting toward the window and looking at the chaotic battle, Yang Ling doubtfully shook his head. Until he understood the full situation, he was unwilling to tread these waters.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling crease his brows in doubt, the bartender John said calmly, “The Rossi Empire and the Banto Empire are at loggerheads with each other. Their animosity has spanned back a hundred years, and the small skirmishes at their borders have never stopped. The troops and adventurers of the different empires often fight when they encounter each other!”</p> <p>“Oh, is this really a frequent occurrence?”</p> <p>Seeing heavily armored troops coming out of nowhere, then looking at the few men in black hiding behind the large tree at the other side of the bar, Yang Ling let out a cold smile.</p> <p>A ploy, this was definitely a ploy!</p> <p>When the villas of Shangri-La had been booked at high prices, Yang Ling had secretly instructed the thief Fenlist to look into the identities of the renters. The men in black at the other side of the bar were the most mysterious out of the bunch. Yang Ling believed that today’s chaotic battle was definitely not as simple as warriors from the two factions coincidentally meeting each other.</p>",
  "Chapter 65: Rain of Blood": "<p>Hearing that there was a large group of troops and adventurers brawling it out at the door of the Evening Primrose Bar, and that Yang Ling himself was at the bar, Casey did not dare to wait around. He quickly arrived with a group of warriors, Jarlock and his barbarians at the forefront.</p> <p>“Sir, do you want to separate them?” Casey asked loudly as he looked at the chaotic fight of unprecedented scale and the fresh blood on the floor.</p> <p>Yang Ling had not said anything when the rowdy Jarlock waved the giant ax in his hand. “Oh Yiblis, let’s kill them all!”</p> <p>Surrounded by the chaos and the metallic stench of battle, the townspeople were afraid that they wouldn’t be able to hide in time. But Jarlock and the barbarians became excited. Since Yang Ling brought them into town, they had been donning heavy armor and patrolling fixed routes. They had not seen even a thief, much less a pirate. They were bored to tears.</p> <p>“Get the troops to be on alert, but don’t attack first!” Yang Ling had a serious expression. He had a feeling of unease. He had sensed a devious plot. Perhaps this rare period of peace for Wissen Town was about to pass.</p> <p>“Yes, I understand!”</p> <p>Looking at Yang Ling’s serious expression, Casey understood that the situation was not as simple as an ordinary brawl. He instructed the warriors to get into a formation in front of the bar, in case anything unexpected occurred.</p> <p>“You all need not be too nervous. As long as you do not charge out now, I will guarantee your safety!” Looking at the pale customers in the bar, Yang Ling gave a composed smile. “Today, all the drinks will be free, my treat. Ladies, serve the alcohol!”</p> <p>With Yang Ling’s promise of safety, then looking at the heavily armored guards outside the bar, the people heaved a sigh of relief. Most days, the people would mock the barbarians behind their backs because of how ugly they were, but now, looking at their developed muscles and tire-sized axes, they felt an unprecedented sense of security.</p> <p>After taking a few sips of hard liquor, the nervousness of the people slowly quelled. Even without Casey bringing in the large group of guards, as long as Yang Ling was present, the brawling men outside would not dare charge in even if they had the gall of a thousand tigers. In Wissen Town, Yang Ling’s name was the best protective amulet.</p> <p>At the same time, seeing the large group of bloodthirsty guards appear outside the inn, the brawlers out front were unwilling to fight on for any longer. They quickly scattered under the commands of their leaders. They left as quickly as they came, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>“Hmph, Casey, get someone to clean up the battlefield. Wash away the bloodstains!” After giving a cold grunt, Yang Ling left with large strides. This fight had broken out too suddenly. He needed to quickly understand what was going on here.</p> <p>Rome was not built in a day!</p> <p>The sudden appearance of so many brawlers meant that both parties had come prepared. If Yang Ling did not quickly investigate their abilities and the reason they had come to Wissen Town, he would fall into an extremely passive position.</p> <p>After returning to Wissen Castle, Yang Ling instructed Argus to bring him the tactician Goode.</p> <p>“Sir, you are looking for me?” Yang Ling waited for a long time before Goode rushed toward him, his expression sullen as if something grave had just happened, “Someone dug up a dozen headless corpses at the logging area. I was just there to inspect the situation!”</p> <p>A dozen headless corpses? Yang Ling was shocked. It never rains but it pours, huh?</p> <p>“Have you determined the identity of the victims and their time of death?”</p> <p>“According to the decomposition rate of the corpses, the time of death should be within the past few days, but we have not ascertained their identities. Some say that they were a small adventurer squad from the Banto Empire, while some say that they were a team of vagrant troops from the Banto Empire!”</p> <p>Goode shook his head. He had been investigating the matter for half a day, but he had discovered little. There were no markings on the corpses. The place where the corpses were buried was definitely not the primary scene of the crime. The murderer was experienced and incredibly merciless. He had truly committed a perfect crime.</p> <p>“Hah, it’s the Banto Empire once again!”</p> <p>After dealing with the royal Great Swordsman Batiste and then the Wind Troops, Yang Ling did not have a good impression of the Banto Empire. Goode had been framed, and the bartender could not return even though he had a home. Everything that was tied to the Banto Empire was not a good thing.</p> <p>“Hmph, the Banto Empire is already rotten to the core!” Goode clenched his teeth in hatred when he talked about the Banto Empire. Thinking back to the person who framed him many years ago, a blazing flame ignited in his heart.</p> <p>“Goode, do not worry. Once all the preparations are complete, I’ll immediately take action to save your family members!” Seeing Goode’s hatred, Yang Ling knew that he had reminded the man of his sad past.</p> <p>“Thank you sir!” Goode took a deep bow in respect.</p> <p>After propping Goode up, Yang Ling had a thought. “Goode, did you find out anything from Jaynowese, the leader of the Wind Troops?”</p> <p>“No, his lips are tightly sealed. After he realized that he could not escape death, he wouldn’t talk no matter what we did!” Goode shook his head before he continued, “But, according to the reports of our spies, he would often utter gibberish about the leader of Wissen in his sleep. At the same time, the troops we defeated told us that Jaynowese had received a large sum of crystal coins of unknown origin before he came to Wissen Town, as if he had come to Wissen Town to accomplish a secret mission!”</p> <p>“Oh, a secret mission?” Yang Ling creased his brows. “Unfortunately, our channels of intelligence are too narrow. We are at a disadvantage against the troops and adventurers that swarm to this town. Our position will become more and more passive as time goes on!”</p> <p>Yang Ling had an intuition that the chaotic battle of unprecedented scale today might have some connection with Jaynowese’s secret mission. Unfortunately, his ability to collect information was severely lacking, so he had no clear evidence.</p> <p>“Sir, in the prisons, we have a few experts at obtaining information. As long as we dispel their poison with the Water from the Spring of Life, then perhaps…” Looking at Yang Ling and his creased brows, Goode was a little hesitant.</p> <p>“Goode, you can do as you see fit. If the half a bottle of Water from the Spring of Life from the last time is not enough, you can come look for me!” Yang Ling understood Goode’s intentions. He continued, “Also, no matter what method you use, you have to quickly pry open Jaynowese’s mouth and find out his secrets!”</p> <p>After a few instructions, Yang Ling walked quickly to his yard. Facing an unknown crisis, his two highest priorities were obtaining accurate information and improving his own abilities. Even if he was unable to advance to the next level, seizing the time to create a few more Wizard Amulets was not a bad option.</p> <p>Ever since he offered the reward of crystal coins, people had been sending him many Magical Beast Essence Crystals and Blood Essences. Coupled with the loot obtained by the spider army, it was enough for him to create a hundred more amulets.</p> <p>Following that, just as Yang Ling was concentrating on his training, the townspeople discovered even more headless corpses. Sometimes, some residents even found people dead at their front door or backyard first thing in the morning.</p> <p>The two sides involved in the conflict at the bar did not rest, starting fights of varying scales. Their conflicts in the dark became even more frequent.</p> <p>The situation was becoming more and more worrisome!</p> <p>Reacting to the requests of the townspeople, Goode once again strengthened the radius and scale of the patrol team. But after a few days of peace, they started discovering headless corpses again. Luckily, the two parties at conflict with each other had not targeted the townspeople for the time being, nor did they dare cause trouble in Yang Ling’s territory.</p> <p>When fights broke out, the people would be guaranteed that their lives would be safe if they hid in the Shangri-La Inn, the dwarves’ weapon shop, or the Evening Primrose Bar. No one dared disturb the heavily guarded Wissen Castle. Yang Ling, who was cultivating his abilities at the moment, had become the greatest protection amulet that the people possessed.</p>",
  "Chapter 66: I’m Not a Butcher": "<p>After closing himself off and training for three days, Yang Ling heard Casey’s shouts from outside the yard the moment he opened his eyes. Walking out to take a look, he saw that Goode, the old butler Murbaqi, and the rest of his people were all there. Basically everyone he employed was present.</p> <p>“Sir, there’s trouble!” Casey was sweating out of anxiety. “If you had come out any later, things might have gotten bad at the Shangri-La Inn!”</p> <p>Trouble? Could the troops have initiated a battle within Shangri-La?</p> <p>As Casey rambled on in anxiety, Yang Ling’s expression turned serious. If the two groups were openly battling in Shangri-La, it meant that the situation had gotten irreversibly serious and that there was no more salvaging the situation.</p> <p>Seeing that Yang Ling’s expression had become serious, and Casey was tripping over himself as he tried to explain, Goode let out a soft cough and summarized the situation.</p> <p>During the few days Yang Ling had been training, the situation had gotten tenser. The warriors of the Banto and Rossi Empires were openly initiating battles around the town. One-on-ones, group brawls, assassinations, poisoning… They went to all the extremes, covering Wissen Town in a rain of blood.</p> <p>In order to ensure their own safety, the troops and adventurers who had been living in tents all swarmed into Shangri-La, fearful that they would be killed while they were camping in the wilderness.</p> <p>There were a limited number of rooms in Shangri-La. In order to secure a room, the troops had been arguing with each other. The fee of ten Black Crystal Coins a day for an ordinary room had been raised to a hundred Black Crystal Coins a day. Those who failed to get a room or did not have enough money decided to set up their tents right outside the door of Shangri-La, some even finding a spot within the inn to lie down.</p> <p>It would have been alright if the only problem was a crowded inn, but two days previous, several injured soldiers of unknown origin had also swarmed into Shangri-La to take cover. A large group of warriors in black armor had chased after them. Even though they did not dare go on a killing spree within the inn, they were barricading the door. The situation was getting more and more dire.</p> <p>A large group of black armored warriors are barricading the door of Shangri-La?</p> <p>Yang Ling let out a cold smile at how daring these people were. After a moment’s deliberation, he summoned the Unicorn and mounted it. “Casey, gather the warriors under you and follow me to Shangri-La, quick!”</p> <p>“Sir, the situation is dire! You must not act recklessly!” Seeing Yang Ling prepared to take drastic action, Goode quickly spouted words of caution.</p> <p>“Goode, it is precisely because the situation is dire that we have to take action.” Yang Ling patted the Unicorn beneath him and said, “If we do not take action now, the black armored warriors will think of us as cowards. Their actions will become more and more insolent. When the time came and we had no choice but to deal with them, things would already be completely out of control!”</p> <p>After waiting for a moment and confirming that Casey was almost done with his preparations, Yang Ling tapped the Unicorn with his heels and charged out like the wind. Behind him, Casey followed closely leading a group of guards. Goode, Murbaqi, and the rest also followed on horses.</p> <p>They were still some distance from Shangri-La, but they could already see a large group of black armored guards barricading the door of the inn. Some were waving their sharp longswords and shouting loudly, and some had flaming torches on their bows, riding around Shangri-La on their horses as if prepared to burn Shangri-La to the ground. At the same time, there were the sounds of crying and shouts of alarm within the inn itself. But seeing the number of fierce black armored guards, no one dared charge out of the inn.</p> <p>Neigh…</p> <p>Quickly, the cries of the Unicorn had attracted the attention of the black armored warriors. Soon, a person who seemed like the leader walked forward under the cover of his guards. “Sir Yang, please stop!”</p> <p>“Give me a reason to spare your lives!” Yang Ling looked coldly at the leader of the black armored guards. He summoned his Magical Beast army in a steady stream after forming a hand gesture.</p> <p>Looking at the dozen-meter tall Withered Tree Warriors covered in thorns, seeing the Evil Eyes that quickly got into formation and the speedy Horned Bee Beasts circling in the air, the leader of the black armored guards lost his color and swallowed with some difficulty. He had not expected Yang Ling to be prepared to attack directly without any negotiations.</p> <p>After silently grabbing a bunch of Wizard Amulets, Yang Ling said coldly, “I’ll count to three. Give me a reason to spare your lives, otherwise…”</p> <p>“Sir, this is a misunderstanding, we…”</p> <p>Originally, the leader of the black armored warriors had wanted to say a few more words, but seeing the cold glint in Yang Ling’s eyes, and Casey quickly leading a group of knights toward them, he could not help but become more and more nervous.</p> <p>“Hmph, you’re asking for death!” Yang Ling let out a cold grunt and instructed the Evil Eyes to attack immediately as a warning to the other party. In that instant, the concentrated rain of light fell onto the group of black armored warriors. After that single attack, there were now dozens of burned corpses in black armor sprawled on the ground.</p> <p>“You… Fine, let’s go!” Seeing Yang Ling’s powerful abilities and his unwillingness to negotiate, the leader of the black armored warriors was as shocked as he was furious. He turned around and ordered his warriors to retreat immediately. They soon vanished deep into the forest.</p> <p>Against Yang Ling’s massive Magical Beast army, the leader of the black armored warriors knew that they were definitely no match for Yang Ling without the help of a large number of Spellcasters. Just the Evil Eyes alone would have proved too much for them. However, he would seek Yang Ling out for revenge. Reinforcements would arrive in Wissen Town in two days, and then Yang Ling would get a taste of the power of the black armored army of the Banto Empire.</p> <p>Seeing the black armored warriors leave quickly, cheers came from within the inn. At this moment, be it the merchants who had come to do business, or the troops and adventurers, all believed that the Shangri-La was the safest place within Wissen Town.</p> <p>After recalling his Magical Beast army, Yang Ling walked slowly into Shangri-La, greeting the people as he walked. After making two rounds around the inn, he was about to leave. But unexpectedly, he saw a familiar figure: a slender, graceful figure.</p> <p>Seeing the slender legs and curvaceous waist of the veiled spellcaster Michelle, he finally understood what the Golden Ratio was. This was what the words “true beauty” really meant. His only regret was seeing the housefly-like knight beside her.</p> <p>“Miss Michelle, to think that we would meet here!” Yang Ling smiled. “Thank you for your help the other day; otherwise, Sofia would have been in trouble!”</p> <p>After the encounter in Terras Forest, Sofia had told him the veiled spellcaster’s name. If he was correct, the spellcaster Michelle and the knight Clause were envoys sent by the Church. Clause was cold and proud, but Michelle was passionate and friendly. If they became more familiar with each other, he could perhaps find out about some secret about the dragon’s treasure through her.</p> <p>Because of the rumors of a dragon’s treasure found within Terras Forest, there were more and more troops and adventurers swarming into Wissen Town, making the dynamics of the town increasingly complicated. Only by wielding information could he take an active position. The envoys of the Church must have a great many avenues for gaining information, given their status. Yang Ling would not let such an opportunity pass him by.</p> <p>Turning her head and looking at the youthful Yang Ling, Michelle blushed slightly under his gaze. The feeling Yang Ling gave her was special. Even though he was not very handsome, his lazy smile and his unique, pitch black pupils all gave him a special charisma.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, you need not be so formal. That was what we should have done!” After taking a deep breath, Michelle quickly calmed herself down. “Oh yes, Sir Yang, could you help us get two rooms? There are too many injured troops recently, and I have to treat them!”</p> <p>“No problem. If it’s convenient, I would like to invite you as a guest at Wissen Castle!” Yang Ling paused. “Recently, Sofia has been missing you. She would definitely be very happy if you could visit the castle!”</p> <p>“Hmph, a shabby castle, what’s there to be proud of?” When he saw Yang Ling staring at Michelle, Clause became furious. For some reason, he felt frustrated every time he looked at Yang Ling, as if he was feeling unwell.</p> <p>“That’s right, it’s only a shabby castle, and that’s why I only invited Miss Michelle.” Looking at Clause’s burning eyes, Yang Ling gave him a smile of disdain. He put on an act and said, “This great… great knight, the conditions of my home are not the best, so I shall not invite a great knight in a tortoise shell like you!”</p> <p>Knight in a tortoise shell?</p> <p>He just called the Sekal Knight’s Heavy Armor personally blessed by the Archbishop a tortoise shell?</p> <p>Looking at the grinning Yang Ling, then looking at Clause, his face redder than pig’s liver, Michelle broke out into laughter. In all these years, anyone who met Clause had treated him with the utmost respect. But Yang Ling was different, angering him until he almost vomited blood time and time again.</p> <p>“You… You b*stard, I want to duel you!” Clause clenched his teeth and raised his sharp Darkmetal Longspear, wishing to put a few holes into Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Haha, sorry, my hands are used to kill humans, not pigs. Please forgive me for being unable to accede to your request!” Yang Ling let out a cold smile, then turned to leave while shaking his head. He had just taken a few steps when he turned his head. “Oh yes, I’m sorry, because there are so few rooms, I can only arrange for one room for the time being. I would think that this heroic knight in a tortoise shell would not mind sleeping on the floor for a few days?</p> <p>Sleeping on the floor?</p> <p>As a noble, I have to squeeze on the floor with the group of refugee-like smelly troops?</p> <p>“B*stard, I’m going to kill you!”</p> <p>As he watched Yang Ling leave, Clause felt almost nauseated with anger. But in front of the beautiful Michelle, in order to protect his image as a knight, all he could do was suppress the flames of anger that were about to erupt like a volcano. He swore secretly that he was going to one day pull out Yang Ling’s despicable tongue. He was going to step on Yang Ling like he was killing an ant, giving him no way of bouncing back.</p>",
  "Chapter 67: Interrogation": "<p>After obtaining a full bottle of Water from the Spring of Life, Goode was confident. He selected twenty able men from the Anca family. Some of them were Great Swordsmen, some were Spellcasters, and some were tacticians that specialized in analyzing and collecting information.</p> <p>After confirming that the poison was cleared from their bodies, with Goode’s guidance, the captives all promised loyalty toward Yang Ling. With this batch of talents, Yang Ling created a preliminary intelligence network, codenamed Parrot. With the situation in Wissen Town getting more and more complicated, they would need timely and accurate information to stay on top of things.</p> <p>After organizing their manpower and logistical support, Parrot quickly took off. Some of its members disguised themselves as troops and mixed in with those in Wissen Town, some acted as small-time merchants, setting up stalls on the streets, and others pretended to be vagrants with nowhere to return to… Coupled with the tips they received from the citizens of Wissen Town, they quickly became a continuous source of intelligence.</p> <p>In order to ascertain that the information they got was accurate, Goode asked Casey to secretly arrest a few suspicious characters and begin interrogating them. After all, there were more and more troops and adventurers swarming into Wissen Town, and there were also frequent conflicts between various factions. The sudden disappearance of a few people did not attract too much attention.</p> <p>With the information brought in by the spy network and the interrogations, the situation slowly became clearer. It turned out that ever since rumors spread of dragon treasure in Terras Forest, a large group of adventurers and troops had swarmed to Wissen Town from all over the land, planning to make it to the dragon’s treasure first. Some even said that powerful figures who had lived hidden for many years had also made their way here.</p> <p>Even though there were many troops and adventurers who had made their way here, most of them were from either the Banto Empire, the Rossi Empire, or the Livenza Alliance. These three powerhouses were the nearest to Terras Forest. The relationships between them were complicated, but also delicate.</p> <p>The Banto Empire was powerful had many material resources, while the Rossi Empire in the north had expansive land, and their knights were famed around the world. The two empires competed with each other for land and resources such as the crystal cores at their borders. With the accumulation of years of animosity, warriors from both countries would escalate a simple argument into a large scale battle when they encountered each other.</p> <p>The Livenza Alliance was pincered between the Banto and Rossi Empires, and was formed by fifteen member countries. They had a developed merchant sector. They not only had many Spellcasters, but they had also gathered many groups of troops with powerful abilities. That was the reason why the Banto and Rossi Empires had been failing to colonize these countries, despite frequent attempts. The Livenza Alliance also remained as neutral as possible in the conflict between the two empires, hoping to remain on friendly terms with both.</p> <p>Currently, with the numbers of troops gathering at Wissen Town, the people from the Banto Empire and the Rossi Empire were once again escalating simple arguments into large scale battles, drenching Wissen Town in a rain of blood. The troops from the Livenza Alliance and the rest of the countries adopted a neutral stance, choosing to watch from the sidelines.</p> <p>Since they were closer to Wissen Town, there were more troops from the Banto Empire, causing them to have the obvious upper hand in the conflict. If not for Yang Ling forcefully controlling the situation, the black armored warriors from the Banto Empire might have already bathed Shangri-La in blood.</p> <p>“Goode, you mean that this is just an ordinary conflict?” Yang Ling remained unmoved after hearing Goode’s report.</p> <p>“Since we do not have enough intelligence, we cannot yet determine if there is a deeper motive for the conflict.” Goode hesitated for a moment, then continued, “But, with more and more people swarming into Wissen Town, it would be best to strengthen our defenses!”</p> <p>Over the last few days, despite the frequent brawls, the number of people entering Wissen Town had not decreased. Instead, it had increased, putting pressure on Casey’s defense forces and Goode’s intelligence team. This was especially so for Goode. He was busy all day long, having to oversee the expansion of the villas at Shangri-La, as well as analyze the intelligence and create contingency plans.</p> <p>“They’re secretly tabulating the population and property of the citizens. Haha, Goode, don’t you feel that there’s something off?” Yang Ling took out a piece of intelligence from his robes and said coldly, “The troops coming to Wissen Town are supposedly employed by merchants traveling here or hunting for Magical Beast Essence Crystals. But have you ever seen troops that would tabulate the population and property of the citizens?”</p> <p>After taking the intelligence report Yang Ling threw onto the table, Goode shivered, instantly understanding two things. First, these troops were definitely not doing something as simple as fighting each other. Second, Yang Ling still had a secret source of intelligence. Yang Ling could find out things even Goode didn’t know about, and he could do it without even leaving the house.</p> <p>Someone in a powerful position would never just have one pair of eyes or one trusted aide around him. Even though he was shocked and surprised, Goode quickly calmed down. Yang Ling had a mysterious background. Even though everyone knew that he was a noble from a rich family, no one was clear as to the exact family he was from. To a rich noble, having many eyes around him was normal. On the contrary, only having one pair of eyes looking out for him would be considered strange.</p> <p>Goode was surprised. But if he had known that all Yang Ling did was ask his guard Argus’s brother, the thief Arkas, to conduct a secret investigation, he might have been even more surprised.</p> <p>To many of the rich nobles, a thief like Arkas was less than a dog. But to Yang Ling, a sleazeball like Arkas could also become a talent if utilized well. Sometimes, the things that a person like that unintentionally heard or saw might also be valuable information.</p> <p>“Goode, has Jaynowese revealed anything yet?”</p> <p>“Not yet! So far, he has not opened his mouth.” Goode shook his head. He had been very busy recently. He had not had the time to think about how to get Jaynowese to open up.</p> <p>“Haha, let’s go get that old man to spit out even his tongue!” Yang Ling said, taking large strides out of the room.</p> <p>He had a hunch that Jaynowese’s secret mission had a connection with the complicated situation in town. He would definitely make a breakthrough, an important breakthrough, if he managed to pry open the old man’s mouth.</p> <p>Under the yellow light, the once arrogant Jaynowese was sprawled on the cold floor, motionless and covered in blood. It looked like he had suffered greatly.</p> <p>“Get up! Oh Yiblis, are you planning to feign death all day?” Under Yang Ling’s instructions, two muscular barbarians picked Jaynowese up and splashed a basin of ice-cold spring water onto him. In that instant, Jaynowese shivered, helplessly opening his eyes.</p> <p>“Jaynowese, I’ll give you another chance!” Yang Ling paused before saying coldly, “Tell me what you know, otherwise…”</p> <p>“Dream on! Kill me if you can, hahaha!” Jaynowese laughed maniacally. “Don’t expect to pry out anything from my mouth. You won’t be safe even if I become a ghost. Hahaha, soon, there will be someone to claim your life. Then, you will come be buried with us, father and son!”</p> <p>With his son dead and his troops exterminated, Jaynowese had already slipped into despair. He knew that even if Yang Ling were to spare his life, his backer would never let him off now that he had lost his value, in case he revealed too many secrets. In his despair, he no longer feared any threats. He hated Yang Ling, the person who had caused all of this, to the core.</p> <p>Seeing Jaynowese’s manic state, Yang Ling let out a cold smile. He knew that to deal with such a stubborn person on the brink of death, he had to take drastic measures. He softly gave instructions to the barbarian beside him. The latter was shocked, but fiercely nodded his head.</p> <p>After taking a deep breath, the violent barbarian began snapping the bone in Jaynowese’s calf inch by inch. He would then give him a drop of the Water from the Spring of Life when Jaynowese was half dead, then repeat the act when he recovered. Jaynowese’s existence became a living hell.</p> <p>“Ah… You devil, don’t even dream of learning my secrets!” Jaynowese, who had been tortured so much that he no longer resembled a human, did not confess even after Yang Ling visited the jail again a day later.</p> <p>“Hah, since that is the case, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” After a cold smile, Yang Ling summoned a hungry Horned Bee Beast and instructed it to pounce onto Jaynowese’s right leg.</p> <p>Jaynowese hadn’t spoken when he was being brutally beaten by the barbarians; he would clench his teeth and bear the pain when the barbarian was snapping his leg bones inch by inch. But when he watched helplessly as the Horned Bee Beast tore into the flesh of his leg, the terrifying scene and the deep, soul-burning pain finally caused him to break down.</p> <p>He completely broke down!</p> <p>Under Goode’s interrogation, the broken Jaynowese answered all the questions truthfully, even telling them what underwear his wife’s friends wore. At this point, he did not beg to live, instead he begged Goode to end him swiftly.</p> <p>It turned out that because of the constant warfare, the resources of the Banto Empire had been stretched thin. With no choice left, they had set their sights on the Terras Forest and its rich resources, planning to incorporate the independent Wissen Town into their empire.</p> <p>The king was wary of the empire’s enemies foiling the plan. After a secret discussion with his officials, the king had decided to give the area of a thousand miles around Wissen Town to the Waize family so that they could colonize Wissen Town in the name of the family. He would then announce this to the world once their control had been firmly established.</p> <p>Jaynowese had been employed by the Waize family to eliminate any organizations that would be a threat in Wissen Town. He was instructed to complete the foundational work and pave the way for the town’s new leadership. According to Jaynowese’s confession, other than the Wind Troops that he led, the Waize family had also sent out a large number of warriors from their family.</p> <p>After forcing out Jaynowese’s secret, everyone was shocked. It looked like the Rossi Empire had discovered the plan and sent people to sabotage the operation. The warriors from the Waize family had been unwilling to back down, creating a rain of blood within Wissen Town.</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, Goode clenched his teeth and said, “Sir, Wissen Town is our headquarters. Should we act first and announce that the thousand mile area around the town is our territory?”</p> <p>“No, let them fight it out with one another first. There’s no need for us to stand up in this sandstorm!” Yang Ling decided against Goode’s tempting proposition after deliberating for a moment.</p> <p>The forest wind would blow off the taller trees in the wood!</p> <p>Both the Banto and Rossi Empires were wolves that devoured their enemies whole. Sticking their heads out at this point of time would only make them the target of both factions. Even though his Magical Beast army was at a decent size, Yang Ling was not so foolish as to believe that he could fight off an expansive empire. At this point, consolidating his forces and observing the trends was the best thing he could do.</p>",
  "Chapter 68: A Leader That Fell From the Sky": "<p>After understanding the complicated situation, Yang Ling started preparing for the future. He instructed Goode to secretly gather important items such as armor, weapons, and rations, while he personally made a trip to the barbarian and elf tribes, once again recruiting a hundred barbarian warriors and fifty elf archers. Coupled with the one hundred hunters he recruited in Wissen Town, he now had a few hundred more guards in his hands.</p> <p>After some consideration, Yang Ling split the many warriors into four camps in order to enhance their battle abilities. The swordsman camp and knight camp were helmed by Casey, while Yang Ling personally took charge of the vanguard camp and the archer camp for the time being.</p> <p>At Goode’s suggestion, Yang Ling also set up a logistics camp. They were personally led by Goode, and their responsibilities included supplying armor and rations. As an ex-commander of war preparations for the empire, Goode was extremely familiar to the logistical needs of an army. Under his command, the logistics camp quickly took off.</p> <p>Yang Ling had more than two hundred ferocious barbarians, two hundred elf archers, and nearly three hundred high level swordsmen, coupled with the majestic castle and the decently sized Magical Beast army. Yang Ling believed that unless his opponents sent an army of ten thousand or more to attack the town, it would be hard for either empire to successfully invade. The only problem was that they did not have too many Spellcasters; there were only a mere fifty of them, including Goode and Sofia. Otherwise, they would be even more powerful.</p> <p>Originally, Yang Ling had thought about expanding the Maze Formation to cover the entire castle. But after seriously calculating the number of Essence Crystals he would need, he had no choice but to give up. Wissen Tower was too large, and without ten thousand Magical Beast Essence Crystals, there was no way that he could construct such a massive Maze Formation.</p> <p>Hunting or purchasing tens of thousands of Magical Beast Essence Crystals was unrealistic. He pinned his hope on the mineral crystals, hoping that he would one day discover a crystal mine that he could claim as his own. When that time came, he would have no problems expanding the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation to cover the entire castle, much less the Maze Formation.</p> <p>After giving clear instructions to his subordinates, Yang Ling closed himself in and started training. Recently, he had begun to feel as though he was at a bottleneck. He believed that he could advance to being a mid level Spirit Wizard if he charged past this bottleneck.</p> <p>In order to guarantee his safety while he was training, he ordered Argus to lead the personal guards to heavily defend the villa he was staying in. He also summoned the Horned Bee Beasts, the Evil Eyes, the Unicorn, and the Withered Tree Warriors to protect him.</p> <p>Now that the situation in Wissen Town was getting more complicated, it would be more difficult to detect if any experts or heaven-ranked assassins were secretly infiltrating the castle. He didn’t want to be stabbed in the back while he was training.</p> <p>After sitting down cross-legged, he looked at the Withered Tree Warriors around him which had turned into ancient trees, then looked at the six-foot-tall Sapling of the Tree of Life not far away. Yang Ling had a thought. He tried to do two things at once, circulating the Wizard Power in his body while he recited the psychic mantra. Slowly, not only did the rich spiritual energy in the surroundings enter his body, the ancient trees formed by the Withered Tree Warriors also released bolts of pale green light.</p> <p>With his mind clear, he could feel the spiritual energy that was welling into his body growing increasingly richer. The green life force that he was absorbing was also more thick and pure. The two energies circulated around a mysterious path after they fused, their speeds getting faster with every circulation. With every passing day, the energy would cleanse his bones and meridians.</p> <p>As time passed, Yang Ling felt more comfortable, as though he was riding on a cloud. Slowly, the whispers of the barbarians disappeared, the rustling of the forest far away vanished, and his awareness became hazier. If someone were to walk past now, his body would sometimes appear red, sometimes dark green, and sometimes it would slowly fade away entirely. There would even be times where he would vanish where he sat…</p> <p>Sometime later, when a cold wind carrying flakes of snow blew past, Yang Ling felt a streak of cold and slowly opened his eyes. All he saw were the snowflakes dotting the sky. The far away Terras Forest was a piece of white, and the ancient trees formed by the Withered Tree Warriors were also piled tall with snow.</p> <p>Winter has finally arrived!</p> <p>He had just opened his eyes when he felt that there were many people at the door of the villa. Walking out, he found Casey, Sofia, Murbaqi, and the rest pacing anxiously.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, you’ve finally come out! There would have been trouble if you came out any later!” Yang Ling had just opened the wooden door when the pacing dwarf Rumi shouted loudly, “Poor me, I’ve had nothing to drink for the past month… Oh god, who’s more pitiful than me?”</p> <p>Looking at the depressed dwarf Rumi, Yang Ling shook his head. “Why are you all here? Just what has happened?”</p> <p>“Yang Ling, the Evening Primrose Bar has been trashed!” Seeing Yang Ling finally come out, Sofia pounced into his embrace without hesitation, tears covering her face. If not for the fact that Yang Ling could not be disturbed while he was training, she would have charged in long ago.</p> <p>Someone trashed the Evening Primrose Bar? Yang Ling was very surprised. In Wissen Town, what blind fool would have such guts? Could it have been that leader…?</p> <p>Yang Ling was confused, his expression dark. Goode quickly explained, confirming Yang Ling’s guess.</p> <p>His training session had taken a full month and a half. Two weeks ago, a noble by the name of Steve had brought a team of three thousand Black Armor Guards, claiming to be the Leader of Wissen Town as appointed by the king of the Banto Empire. He announced that from that day on, the area within a five thousand mile radius around Wissen Town would be his personal territory.</p> <p>When he arrived at Wissen Town, the so-called leader Steve had immediately unleashed a fearful rain of blood, mercilessly massacring the troops and adventurers that came from the Rossi Empire. The factions from the Rossi Empire did not back down. Instead, they hid and recovered in the Terras Forest, occasionally slipping out of the shadows to assassinate Steve’s soldiers.</p> <p>From that instant, swords filled Wissen Town. Many died on the streets every day, causing the people of Wissen Town to become very fearful.</p> <p>Perhaps the black armored warriors were cautious of Yang Ling’s massive abilities, or perhaps they simply hadn’t reached their planned time of attack. Either way, Steve did not dare openly deal with the average citizen when he first arrived in the town. But after he expelled the factions from the Rossi Empire and victory was basically at hand, he finally revealed his evil intentions and started imposing exorbitant taxes on every household.</p> <p>Merchants were required to pay taxes, loggers were required to pay taxes, hunters were required to pay taxes. In fact, the so-called leader Steve did not even let an infant go. Taxes were paid by the person. Even if an old person had died, he would have to pay taxes if he hadn’t been buried yet. Without Yang Ling’s support, the townspeople did not dare speak out against this despite their raging anger.</p> <p>At the start, Steve had not dared to mess with Yang Ling. But now that he had collected more and more crystal coins, his appetite became increasingly larger. He set his sights on the profitable Evening Primrose Bar.</p> <p>One night, a few Black Armor Guards made the excuse that there was a dead fly in their rum and brutally assaulted the bartender John. They even tried to molest a young hostess. After being stopped by the barbarian guards, a few hundred prepared Black Armor Guards suddenly appeared out of nowhere, manically attacking the barbarian warriors. Luckily, Casey arrived in time leading a big army after he heard the news, saving the frightened female hostess and heavily injured barbarians just in time.</p> <p>Even though they had managed to save the people, the Evening Primrose Bar and the alcohol refinery had been smashed to a pulp. The violent Black Armor Guards even shamelessly announced that they would capture the people in Wissen Castle.</p> <p>Capture the people in Wissen Castle?</p> <p>“Hehe, great, what a powerful leader!” Yang Ling gave a cold laugh as he held Sofia, who had spent much of her energy on the Evening Primrose Bar and refinery.</p> <p>There were two kinds of villains in the world. The first would repent after being taught a harsh lesson; the second would only become worse no matter what lesson they were taught. They would not learn until they saw the inside of their own coffins. Clearly, this leader that feared the strong and bullied the weak was the latter.</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, Yang Ling thought of an idea for a counterattack, an extremely clever idea.</p>",
  "Chapter 69: Visit of the Pig Leader": "<p>After consoling the group, Yang Ling shot a glance toward Goode, then walked to the secret room behind the meeting room with large steps. Since Yang Ling hadn’t been present for a month, the table of the secret room was covered in intelligence reports of various kinds.</p> <p>“Goode, this so-called leader, what do you think about him?” Yang Ling asked the tactician the moment he entered the room.</p> <p>“Sir, the situation is extremely disadvantageous to us!” Goode had an ugly expression. While Yang Ling was training, Goode had been churning his brain, thinking of ways to deal with the leader Steve.</p> <p>After a pause, Goode continued, “Other than the three thousand Black Armor Guards, Steve also brought with him dozens of Spellcasters. A few days ago, I tried infiltrating his base along with a Great Swordsman, but we <em>were </em>met with a ferocious attack before we even got near Steve’s tent. If my guess is not wrong, there must be some brilliant guards around Steve.”</p> <p>Goode took off his shirt. A scar extended from his collarbone down his ribcage, jarring to the sight. If the cut had been a little deeper, he might have met with misfortune. The Great Swordsman who followed him was in even worse condition. He had not only lost a limb, but his protective Battle Energy was also completely scattered, causing his cultivation level to decrease dramatically. He might not be able to fully recover for the rest of his life. If not for Casey leading a few experts to fetch them, they might not have been able to escape.</p> <p>Yang Ling’s expression became serious. He had not expected Steve’s abilities to be this powerful. This person was dangerous, the family behind him even more so. To be able to quickly dispatch three thousand Black Armor Guards and dozens of Spellcasters, a family like this might be rare even in the Tailun Continent, much less the Banto Empire alone.</p> <p>“Sir, what we should do now is to avoid facing Steve head on. It will be best to let him fight against the factions of the Rossi Empire before we…”</p> <p>“Haha, you’re right!” Yang Ling and Goode looked at each other and smiled. They both know the logic behind how a third party could gain an advantage when two parties fought.</p> <p>Even though they were in a disadvantageous situation for the time being, the people of the Rossi Empire would keep attempting to foil the plans of the Banto Empire. This could be seen from how frequently Steve’s men were assassinated. If Yang Ling aided the troops hiding in the Terras Forest with weapons, rations, and intelligence, Yang Ling believed that Steve, the leader that appeared out of nowhere, would be defeated quickly.</p> <p>“The Banto Empire has about a twelve hundred men here, the Rossi Empire about eight hundred, the Livenza Alliance about a thousand, and people from other areas total about two thousand…”</p> <p>Sitting down on the tigerskin chair, Yang Ling took out the vellum that contained an analysis of the troops and adventurers. He had a thought when he read its contents. “Goode, other than pitting Steve and the soldiers of the Rossi Empire against each other, are there any ways that we could launch an attack ourselves?”</p> <p>“There are many ways, but they all require a large amount of time to set up!” Goode shook his head in frustration. They had too few resources that they could make use of. Whether they employed troops from a large city or recruited a brilliant killer, any action would take a certain amount of time.</p> <p>“Actually, we still have a way!” Yang Ling handed the intelligence report in his hands over to Goode. He said meaningfully after a pause, “There is a large number of troops and adventurers gathered at Wissen Town. It would be a waste to not make use of them!”</p> <p>“Sir, you mean to involve the troops and adventurers of the Livenza Alliance and the other areas in the conflict?”</p> <p>“Hehe, that’s right! The more chaotic the situation, the more advantageous it is to us!” Yang Ling let out a cold smile. “If one day, the neutral troops and adventurers suddenly realized that one of their partners had died, and that staying on the sidelines would be akin to waiting for death, they would become paranoid. If they believed that their attacker would pursue them, then they might fight instead of running. I believe that would be very interesting!”</p> <p>“But, how can we point the spears of those troops toward Steve?”</p> <p>Goode quickly understood Yang Ling’s intentions, but he could not think of exactly how Yang Ling’s goal could be achieved. After all, the soldiers were not fools. They would not be easily motivated to engage the powerful Steve.</p> <p>Leaning back in his comfortable chair, Yang Ling gently rubbed his temples. “Simple. All we have to do is leave evidence unfavorable toward Steve at the scene of the assassination, like a piece of black armor, or something to indicate the Black Armor Guards. I believe that the troops would naturally guess who had committed the act!”</p> <p>Yang Ling said it nonchalantly, but Goode still felt that something was off. “Sir, pardon me for being a little slow, but how are we going to get the troops to believe that Steve would not let them go?”</p> <p>“Haha, the most important thing to a king is his rule. He would strike without hesitation at whoever could pose a threat to his authority. A leader is no exception, especially a leader whose position is not yet stable. He will definitely not tolerate a large group of armed men in his territory that won’t listen to his commands!” As Goode listened to him intently, Yang Ling continued, “As long as we release the right rumors at the opportune time, the soldiers will buy our story completely!”</p> <p>A lie becomes the truth if repeated a thousand times!</p> <p>Yang Ling believed that as long as they planned meticulously, he would be able to stir the waters, defeat Steve, and make him run for his life. When the moment was right, Yang Ling would strike a fatal blow against this leader who had appeared out of nowhere.</p> <p>Straight to the weak spot!</p> <p>After thinking about it for a moment, Goode was in awe of Yang Ling. Powerful abilities, and waves upon waves of brilliant plans. Goode felt lucky that he was not Yang Ling’s enemy.</p> <p>Back when Yang Ling killed Ymir, Goode had thought that Yang Ling had won out of luck. Now that he thought back on it, it was not as simple as having good luck. If not for Yang Ling intentionally humiliating him time and time again, Ymir would not have been so rash. If not for Yang Ling hiding his abilities, Ymir would not have been so arrogant, thinking that Yang Ling would fall to a single blow from the Nine-headed Snake Demon.</p> <p>He was both an Ancient Summoner and a Tree Shepherd; either of those titles was enough to scare someone to death. Goode could not think of which family Yang Ling was born to, for him to have such brilliant abilities at such a young age.</p> <p>He uses the carrot and the stick when dealing with his subordinates, inspiring gratitude and respect. He was kind and generous when dealing with the servants and townspeople, willing to step up for the poor Madam Angela, not even hesitating to give the hundred-year-old ginseng to a penniless girl. When dealing with an enemy, he is as merciless as a wolf, willing to use any means necessary. He kills without batting an eyelid.</p> <p>The more Goode understood Yang Ling, the more shocked he felt.</p> <p>But Goode knew that as long as he did not have any thoughts of rebellion, Yang Ling would forever treat him with respect. As long as he could make Yang Ling know his worth, Yang Ling would keep his promise and spare no effort in saving Goode’s family. As a middle-aged man whose family had been split apart, he was already satisfied that he had found such a master.</p> <p>After some preparations, Goode started coming up with plans, discussing some specific details with Yang Ling. On the grander scheme of things, Yang Ling usually had his own farsighted views, but in regards to the details, the older Goode often had years worth of experience on Yang Ling. After all, Goode had been a commander of army logistics in the Banto Empire; he was not a worthless person.</p> <p>With Goode’s assistance, Yang Ling felt more at ease. Otherwise, if he were to think about how to establish a connection with the people from the Rossi Empire one step at a time, how to spread the rumors, how to communicate with an assassin’s guild, his hair might have turned white overnight.</p> <p>“Sir, the despicable Pig Leader Steve pays us a visit!” Just as Yang Ling felt that his discussions with Goode were almost complete, the guard Argus gently knocked on the door.</p> <p>Pig Leader?</p> <p>Yang Ling and Goode looked at each other and laughed. It looked like the impression Steve had made on the townspeople was worse than they thought. They saw Steve as a dumb, lazy Sharo Boar instead of a high-above leader that people idolized.</p>",
  "Chapter 70: One Has to Keep a Low Profile": "<p>After Yang Ling finished his cup of tea and slowly walked into the main hall, he found a bunch of people already sitting within, their weapons raised. There were warriors wearing Kevlar Heavy Armor, spellcasters dressed in long robes, and mysterious fighters wearing cloaks. There were many people, all surrounding a slightly pale young man.</p> <p>“The first thing I heard when I woke up in the morning was a Bisee Bird chirping non-stop. I didn’t understand what was going on even after thinking for so long. It turns out that it is you, Sir Leader, gracing me with your presence!”</p> <p>The young man sat on a tall chair with a proper posture, and Yang Ling smiled as he took the seat opposite him. Behind him, Goode, Casey, and the rest formed a semicircle, glaring daggers at the guards Steve had brought with him.</p> <p>Steve didn’t say anything, but beside him, an elder with triangular eyes said, “Hmph, Sir Yang, how important do you think you are, for you to make our Young Master wait for a full hour!”</p> <p>“Oh, I’m really sorry for making you wait that long!” Yang Ling looked sincerely at Triangle Eyes. “Some time ago, the barbarians sent me a wolf that barked non-stop, buzzing around all day like a fly. In my anger, I pulled out its tongue. That’s why it took me some time, please forgive me!”</p> <p>A wolf that buzzed like a fly?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling spouting nonsense, then looking at triangle-eyes, Casey and the rest wanted to laugh. However, they didn’t dare to laugh out loud, and their faces turned red from holding it in. As for Triangle Eyes, who had threatened Yang Ling, his body trembled in anger. He had wanted to shout at Yang Ling, but he could only keep his mouth shut after the pale Steve glared at him.</p> <p>After a cold grunt, Steve said icily, “Sir Yang, I have long heard that you are extraordinary in terms of talents and looks. It looks like that is not wrong!”</p> <p>“Sir Leader, you overestimate me. Compared to you, I wouldn’t be able to catch up even if I was on a horse!” Yang Ling shook his head. “Sir, you are the leader of an entire land at such a young age, while I can’t even fill my stomach. What a failure, a failure!”</p> <p>Can’t even fill his stomach?</p> <p>Looking at the amused Yang Ling, Steve had a cold glint in his eyes. He let out a grunt, knowing that he had encountered a troublesome opponent. But no matter what, since he had led a large group of warriors here today, he had to deal some damage to Yang Ling.</p> <p>Steve closely observed the warriors behind Yang Ling. At the same time, even though Yang Ling’s expression remained unchanged, he was secretly considering the other party’s motivations for visiting him. The intelligence he had stated that this so-called leader was the youngest son of the Banto Empire’s minister of finance. He was arrogant and overbearing even in the capital because of his family background. It looked like the intelligence reports were correct!</p> <p>To impose huge taxes and be this arrogant and violent, either he was exceptionally powerful, he did not hold any regard for anyone, or his brain had been kicked by a donkey!</p> <p>Every person had their shortcomings. What Yang Ling needed was a general understanding of the other party’s personality, so he would know how to deal with his opposition in the future! When facing such a powerful enemy, some of the creatures in nature would feign death to avoid the crisis; similar to this, in the face of such a powerful enemy, laying low and preserving one’s strength while searching for a chance to counterattack was the best course of action.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Steve decided he needed to find out more about Yang Ling. Even though he was confident that the three thousand Black Armor Guards he brought could level Yang Ling’s castle, he had to be wary of the family backing Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Sir, you have such powerful abilities despite your young age. Might I ask which family you are from? If the noble ladies of the capital knew of such a man with both talent and looks, they would definitely flock to you. What if I introduce you to a few first?”</p> <p>Over the weeks, Steve had spent a great deal of effort investigating Yang Ling’s background. He had learned that Yang Ling belonged to a rich noble family, and that he had a Magical Beast army and a large following.</p> <p>And that was it. Steve knew nothing else about Yang Ling. It was as if Yang Ling had emerged from a rock. There was no way of obtaining clues about his background.</p> <p>Steve did not care much about Yang Ling’s personal guards and Magical Beast army. If he wanted to, he could send the best assassin in the continent to silently dispose of Yang Ling. What he cared about was the family backing Yang Ling. The rumors in Wissen Town and the fact that Yang Ling could spend a large number of crystal coins to set up Shangri-La and the dwarf weapon shop both said that his background was not simple.</p> <p>Framing, assassination, poisoning… Even though there were ten thousand ways to kill Yang Ling, Steve was not willing to act rashly. Even though Wissen Town was important, it was not comparable to the roots his family had within the Banto Empire. He was not willing to risk starting a blood feud with a powerful family. That would create a great deal of trouble for his family and himself.</p> <p>“Sigh, please do not laugh if I say this. There have been floods all year round in my hometown, and my family is so poor that we do not have anything in our home. That was the reason I accidentally wandered into Wissen Town: to make a living!” Knowing that Steve was digging for information, Yang Ling responded with mock embarrassment.</p> <p>Yang Ling did not dare let his guard down. Even though Steve was arrogant due to his exceptional abilities, he was definitely not a fool. Yang Ling could not reveal any information. Otherwise, he would definitely be asking for death! At this point in time, the fake family backing him was his greatest trump card.</p> <p>Indeed, the more Yang Ling spouted nonsense, the more people believed that he came from a family with incredible power. Steve was no exception. Even though he had a deep hatred for Yang Ling, he did not dare to directly spark a conflict with him for the time being. The unknown enemy was the scariest. If Yang Ling was a commoner or any ordinary noble, Steve would have leveled Wissen Castle long ago.</p> <p>In order to find out more about Yang Ling’s background, Steve started talking about anything he could think of. From Wissen Town’s geographical location to the fabled mermaids, from why the flowers were so red to the first snow Wissen Town had seen that year. He even quickly became friendly with Yang Ling, calling him his brother. But despite all his effort, Yang Ling revealed nothing about his background. Steve subsided into frustrated silence.</p> <p>He’s even more crafty than a Germite Snow Rabbit…</p> <p>As Yang Ling sat in calm silence, Steve clenched his teeth in anger. He had seen locust-like thieves, he had punished small merchants who had evaded their taxes, he had executed small officials who withheld information from him. But he had never seen a man as crafty as Yang Ling. But even though he was unable to fully understand Yang Ling’s background, the thought of giving up at this point in time made him feel indignant.</p>",
  "Chapter 71: Extortion": "<p>In order to successfully complete his mission, Steve had brought a full three thousand Black Armor Guards who were adept at battle. But as they rushed to arrive at Wissen Town, their logistical support had suffered. They did not have adequate rations or clothing that could dispel the cold; in fact, they did not even have replacements for the weapons and armor they wore out. That was the reason why Steve had been forced to impose heavy taxes the moment he assumed his position.</p> <p>Even though he knew that imposing heavy taxes would be unfavorable for his future rule, he had no choice. Faced with rapidly depleting rations and the coming winter, he needed a strategy that would yield results immediately. But, he believed that in the face of the three thousand Black Armor Guards he had brought with him, none of the townspeople would riot. Even Yang Ling, who had powerful abilities, was no exception!</p> <p>Steve had gotten whatever he wanted in the capital, and he thought that this would be the same in Wissen Town. As long as he could solidify his rule in Wissen Town, he would be able to return to the capital early and enjoy his fortunes. Wissen Town was such a remote territory, it would naturally be handed over to his servants to care for.</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, Steve decided that he would not waste his breath on unnecessary words. He asked directly, “Brother Yang Ling, I came in a hurry and have no money or rations. I do not even have a place to stay. Would it be convenient for you to lend me a few crystal coins to tide over this crisis?”</p> <p>“No problem! How much do you need? Just state the amount!” Looking at Steve’s superficial smile, Yang Ling knew that this person had finally revealed his evil intentions. He put on an act and said, “Being able to serve Sir Leader is my honor!”</p> <p>On the negotiation table, the person who first showed his cards might not be doomed to lose, but he had definitely accepted a disadvantage. Anyone who revealed his trump card that soon wasn’t likely to win.</p> <p>Seeing the so-called leader Steve lose his patience, Yang Ling felt coldly satisfied. Steve was confident in his power, not only allowing the soldiers under him to trash Yang Ling’s bar and refinery, but also personally leading a large group of warriors into Yang Ling’s home to extort him. He was simply trying to force Yang Ling to fight against him. Yang Ling was going to let him be proud for a little while, but one day, he was going to let this Pig Leader know what pain truly was.</p> <p>Ten years is not a long time to wait for revenge!</p> <p>Casey and the rest were still holding a grudge over losing the bar and refinery, but Yang Ling wasn’t too upset over it. He understood what was more urgent and important. He would lay low and wait, and when he did attack, he would leave no room for his enemy to respond or recover. For now, he was going to maintain a low profile, taking away the other party’s animosity and defensiveness before dealing the fatal blow at the critical time. He believed that when the time came, the so-called leader Steve would not have tears to shed even if he wanted to.</p> <p>While Yang Ling was secretly coming up with a plan, Steve felt rather surprised. Considering that Yang Ling was the sole leader in Wissen Town, he had thought that he would have to spend more effort to convince Yang Ling to help him. Unexpectedly, Yang Ling had been incredibly forthright.</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, he decided to go all the way and seize the opportunity to extort a large sum. He feigned composure and said, “My demands are not high, only a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins!”</p> <p>A hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins?</p> <p>Hearing Steve say this, Casey, Jarlock, and the rest were shocked. They did not expect this person to go this far, asking for a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins at one go.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins, you might as well rob someone. You are basically a thief!” Yang Ling did not react, but the barbarian Jarlock angrily flailed the tire-sized ax in his hands, wanting to split the fair-skinned Steve in two.</p> <p>“Hmph, the guts of you!”</p> <p>Seeing Jarlock raise his ax, Steve’s guards were unwilling to display weakness, all pulling out their weapons. A few Spellcasters quietly muttered incantations. A massive amount of Magical Energy instantly gathered in the air.</p> <p>At the same time, following a wave of indecipherable murmurs from a mysterious man in a cape, Yang Ling felt a sinister air descend from the sky, like a venomous snake slithering outside his body. Quickly, he felt his four limbs become numb.</p> <p>Demonic spells?</p> <p>In his shock, Yang Ling did not dare dally, and he circulated the protective Wizard Power in his body. After the violent Wizard Power clashed with the sinister cold air, it let out bursts of tiny explosions.</p> <p>Failing in his attack, the mysterious man in a cape clenched his teeth indignantly and once again started to murmur. Quickly, Yang Ling felt the cold air grow thicker, quickly sliding through his skin and sinking deeper into his body. In that instant, his pores shrunk, and a thin veil of frost appeared on his skin. He had difficulty breathing, as if the blood in his body had turned into ice.</p> <p>At the critical moment, Yang Ling quickly consumed a few Magical Beast Blood Orbs and tried his best to circulate the Wizard Power that had been fused with the green life force in his body, slowly expelling the cold air. At this situation of life and death, the precious and practical Magical Beast Blood Orbs had once again proven their worth, rapidly replenishing the Wizard Power he had exhausted.</p> <p>Soon after, with the crisp sounds of explosions, Yang Ling successfully dispelled the sinister cold air. At the same time, the mysterious caped man opposite him trembled, as if he suffered an unknown attack.</p> <p>After a dull grunt, the caped man looked at the unshaken Yang Ling in disbelief. He deliberated for a moment before whispering into Steve’s ear. After hearing the words, the latter was immediately shocked. He looked seriously at the mysterious man, then shifted his gaze to Yang Ling and his unchanging expression, his expression getting grimmer and grimmer.</p> <p>Originally, he had wanted to allow his warriors to threaten Yang Ling and gain much more of an advantage. But after learning that Yang Ling had quietly overcome his most powerful guard, he had no choice but to re-evaluate Yang Ling’s abilities. It would be better if he could extort a larger number of crystal coins, but if it was at the cost of severe damage to both parties, or a huge loss in terms of manpower, then it would not be worth it.</p> <p>“Tsk tsk, how powerful. Sir Leader, your men are strong indeed. But, by gathering such a large amount of Magical Energy, are you chiding me for not having enough light in my house and intending to blow a hole in my roof?”</p> <p>After taking in a deep breath, Yang Ling stopped the impulsive Casey and Jarlock, nonchalantly teasing them. Now was not the time to attack. Furthermore, he believed that Steve was merely testing his abilities. Having a falling out now wouldn’t be beneficial to either of them.</p> <p>Indeed, seeing Yang Ling remained unmoved after both his persuasion and his threats, Steve clenched his teeth in disappointment. He quickly calmed down after taking a sip of rum, instructing his guards to lower their weapons. “Sir, if you have difficulties raising the crystal coins, you could also give us an area in the castle to stay in, just so my subordinates wouldn’t freeze outside every day!”</p> <p>Everyone could see his villainous plans clearly!</p> <p>Hearing Steve say this, Yang Ling knew that he had finally stated his true intentions. Asking for money was a ruse, and forcing Yang Ling to hand over Wissen Castle might be his true motive for this trip.</p> <p>“Sir Leader, the crystal coins are not a problem. If it’s just a mere hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins, feel free to take them!” Yang Ling let out a secretive smile. “But housing is a little hard. Given how the rations in town are getting more limited, I was preparing to rear a batch of Sharo Boars in the castle. Sir, you and your subordinates are all of noble status, and I would be offending you if I asked you to eat your meals with a bunch of pigs as your neighbors!”</p> <p>Preparing to raise a batch of Sharo Boars?</p> <p>As Yang Ling spouted more nonsense, Casey and Jarlock struggled not to laugh, holding it in until their stomachs were in knots. Steve was gritting his teeth in fury. At that moment, he did not dare to attack, but he could not think of any retorts to make. His expression became darker and darker.</p>",
  "Chapter 72: Poisonous Bones": "<p>Clenching his teeth, Steve quickly calmed himself down. Now was not the time to start a fight with Yang Ling. Until he investigated the family behind Yang Ling, he needed to be careful.</p> <p>The greater plan would be foiled if he could not tolerate something small like this.</p> <p>Steve remembered the lessons his father taught him before he left for Wissen Town.</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, it is alright if it is inconvenient for you to give us a place to live. Then let me trouble you for the hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins!” Even if he failed to secure the castle, successfully extorting a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins wouldn’t be bad either. Steve settled for second best. As long as he could successfully solidify his rule in Wissen Town, there would be many chances to get Yang Ling to hand over the massive castle. There was no need to be fixated on it at this point in time.</p> <p>Hearing Steve say this, Yang Ling was all smiles. “Murbaqi, quickly help Sir Leader run the calculations. With installments of ten Purple Crystal Coins a day, how long will I need to finish paying him the hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins?”</p> <p>Ten Purple Crystal Coins a day?</p> <p>Steve was dumbfounded, and the old butler Murbaqi was even more shocked when he heard this. Originally, the group had found it rather surprising that Yang Ling would promise to hand over the hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins. Now, with this sudden move, everyone was frozen.</p> <p>After swallowing, the old butler stuttered as he said softly, “Sir, at ten Purple Crystal Coins a day, you will need at least twenty-seven years to fully pay the sum!”</p> <p>Twenty-seven years?</p> <p>Hearing the old butler say this, Yang Ling’s smile became more radiant, while Steve’s face turned a steely green. He had thought that Yang Ling might haggle to reduce the number of crystal coins or even immediately start a fight. But he had not expected Yang Ling to make such a weird move.</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, you sure know how to joke!” After clenching his teeth, Steve forcefully suppressed his impulse to stab Yang Ling and said coldly, “Without the coins, I won’t have anything to eat. It is alright if I go hungry, but my subordinates would have to suffer. I fear that when the time came, even I would not be able to stop them!”</p> <p>Since he could not persuade Yang Ling, Steve could only do this the hard way, coldly laying out words of threat. He could allow Yang Ling to live in the castle a little longer. He could give up on the crystal coins. But if word of Yang Ling taunting and teasing him time and time again was to get out, his reputation would be completely tarnished.</p> <p>In response to Steve’s threats, the guards following him quickly drew their weapons, their bloodlust rising. At the same time, Triangle Eyes released a magic signal, and a resounding boom rang from outside the castle. The three thousand Black Armor Guards that Steve was so proud of closed in toward the castle, bloodthirsty.</p> <p>Seeing their enemies about to strike, Casey had to take action. He instructed the warriors to take their positions and be ready to fight. At the same time, he instructed a group of barbarians to tightly surround Steve and his men.</p> <p>A large battle was about to begin!</p> <p>“Sir Leader, I am not trying to be difficult, but I cannot hand over that many crystal coins in such a short amount of time!” Facing Steve’s powerful guards, the group was incredibly nervous, and only Yang Ling was still smiling nonchalantly. He continued, “I have a few hundred people, which means that I have a few hundred mouths to feed. My income right now isn’t even enough to cover my expenses. Why not do it this way; I still receive a few crystal coins every day at Shangri-La. Sir, why don’t you send a few people there to collect the money? Other than the capital, you can take all of the profit! How about that?”</p> <p>Send someone to Shangri-La to collect the money?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, the crowd was once again surprised. This was especially so for Goode, who had spent much of his energy on Shangri-La. He opened his mouth anxiously, wanting to say something, but had no choice but to close his mouth when Yang Ling shot him a look. At the same time, the surprised Steve creased his brows, seriously thinking about Yang Ling’s intentions.</p> <p>Could it be that there is some hidden ploy here? Or could Yang Ling have buckled under the pressure and be giving in while trying to save face?</p> <p>Steve was extremely confused. He still didn’t fully understand Yang Ling and his mysterious background. Seeing Yang Ling’s sincere expression, he felt as though Yang Ling was not lying. But seeing his faint smile, he felt that there was something wrong with the offer.</p> <p>“Sir Leader, if you are not willing to go through the trouble, I can send over my daily earnings to you!” Yang Ling looked sincerely at Steve. “This money is not aid, you can see it as the taxes I’m paying you, how about that?”</p> <p>Handing over a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins as tax?</p> <p>Goode shook his head in disbelief, but Steve had a glint in his eyes. No matter if Yang Ling had a hidden ploy or not, Steve’s highest priority was getting ahold of the crystal coins. After all, he had come here today with the hope of extorting a sum of crystal coins and the chance to infiltrate Wissen Castle; more importantly, he wanted Yang Ling to show that he was willing to submit to Steve’s rule.</p> <p>Yang Ling was the sole powerhouse in Wissen Town; if he were willing to submit to Steve, the townspeople would likely follow his example. That would be immensely beneficial to Steve’s future plans.</p> <p>The crux of the matter did not lie in the coins!</p> <p>Originally, Steve had thrown out the figure of a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins to make a statement. Even though he was unable to obtain that many crystal coins for the time being, being able to extort Yang Ling’s daily profits from the inn was already an unexpected surprise.</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, you sure are agreeable. From today onward, I will let Midhart be responsible for our communication.”</p> <p>After pretending to be passionate and exchanging formalities, Steve strode confidently out of the castle. Behind him, the guards followed closely, only leaving behind the man with triangle-eyes called Midhart.</p> <p>Even though he was still a little suspicious that Yang Ling was planning something, Steve did not care too much now that he had achieved his goal. Winter had arrived. He had to think of ways to increase taxes, eliminate the factions that did not listen to his commands, and exterminate the people of the Rossi Empire that were hiding within Terras Forest, There were too many things to do. As long as Yang Ling did not show any obvious resistance, he did not have to spend too much effort on him for the time being.</p> <p>When Steve left, Yang Ling told Argus to treat Midhart to a feast. He then instructed everyone to head outside, leaving only Goode.</p> <p>“Sir, Shangri-La is our heart and soul, could you really have…” The crowd had just left when Goode hurriedly voiced the doubt in his heart.</p> <p>“Haha, what a great bargain. As far as the crystal coins are concerned, I don’t want the so-called leader to be able to take them!” After a pause, he looked at the confused Goode and let out a cold smile.</p> <p>“Goode, head to Shangri-La later and place a notice. The ordinary rooms will now cost three hundred Black Crystal Coins a day, the tents in front of the door will go for eighty, and even those who are sleeping on the floor of the inn will have to pay twenty Black Crystal Coins. Make special mention that the increase in price will be handed to the leader as tax! But make sure to tear the notice down before Triangle Eyes reaches the inn!”</p> <p>After his shock, Goode understood. “Sir, you mean to intentionally spark conflict between the neutral parties and Steve?”</p> <p>“Haha, that’s right. Goode, we have to seize the chance and quickly put the previous plan into motion. Establish communications with the Rossi people within Terras Forest as soon as possible.”</p> <p>“Yes, I understand!”</p> <p>After Goode left, Yang Ling leaned comfortably on the tall chair. With the bloodbath in Wissen Town, the only place of refuge left was Shangri-La. For their own safety, merchants, troops, and adventurers would have no choice but to stay there no matter how high the prices were. If he planned it meticulously, the fury in their hearts would naturally be pointed at the arrogant Steve.</p> <p>It was poisonous bait; even a lick would be deadly, much less eating it whole!</p> <p>Yang Ling believed that Steve might feel that he had found treasure now by sending Triangle Eyes to collect the money at Shangri-La, but in the future, he would definitely realize how foolish he had been.</p> <p>As long as he was successful in igniting the conflict between the neutral Livenza Alliance and Steve, coupled with secretly assisting the Rossi people who wanted revenge, Yang Ling believed that the leader who came out of nowhere would be defeated soon enough. The man was unknowingly perched atop a volcano.</p>",
  "Chapter 73: Sowing Discord": "<p>At Shangri-La Inn, people broke into a commotion when they saw the notice on the door.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, the price of an ordinary room rose to three hundred Black Crystal Coins a day? That’s robbery!”</p> <p>“Even sleeping on the floor costs twenty Black Crystal Coins a night! It’s insanity, has Sir Yang gone mad over money?”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The people were in heated discussion, and they were growing more agitated by the minute. They did not expect that the rent would rise so many multiples after they woke up. They all clenched their teeth, repeatedly spouting expletives.</p> <p>Seeing the agitated people, the thief Fenlist made his way amongst them, following Goode’s instructions. “Brothers, this has nothing to do with Sir Yang. Look, the notice states that the rent has not changed; the extra money that is collected will be handed to the leader as a tax!”</p> <p>Handed to the leader as a tax?</p> <p>With Fenlist’s reminder, the angry mob looked closely at the notice on the door. Quickly, they began another angry discussion.</p> <p>“That is too much, collecting such a high tax!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, it’s over! I cannot earn the money, and even the toll fees have been forcefully taken by the leader!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>After understanding the reason for the surge in price, the people were furious. They all pointed their spears at the man that suddenly appeared to be responsible: Steve.</p> <p>Seeing that the time was almost right, a soldier walked out following Goode’s instructions. “Oh Yiblis, that b*stard of a leader unleashed a bloodbath the moment he arrived and is always looking for ways to increase taxes. He is not allowing us to live!”</p> <p>“That’s right! If this goes on, we do not need to think about earning money. We can all just eat wind!”</p> <p>“I heard that many troops that camped in the wilderness were killed last night. There were many pieces of black heavy armor unique to the Banto Empire left at the scene!” a bandit quietly said as he cautiously inspected his surroundings.</p> <p>“Shh, softer! It was not just the Wind Whistling Troops; even the troops that did not want to spend money on Shangri-La suffered several casualties!”</p> <p>“I heard that there was a small group of troops and adventurers who felt that something was off and wanted to flee Wissen Town at night. But in the end, they all died along the way!” After carefully observing the surroundings, a desolate middle-aged man said, “It is rumored that in order to eliminate any dissent, the new leader has forbidden anyone to enter or leave. Those who want to charge out of the town during the chaos will suffer a fate like the Rossi people, being killed and left to rot!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, let’s rebel. If he is not going to let us live, then we should not let him off easy. Let us fight against him!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>With people intentionally sowing discord, the people became more and more agitated. Goode had successfully planted the seeds of hatred in the hearts of the troops and adventurers. All that was lacking was a trigger.</p> <p>Just as the people were cursing Steve and his ancestors, a wave of footsteps could be heard as Triangle Eyes Midhart arrived at Shangri-La riding a horse. “Under the orders of the leader, from today onward, I shall be in charge of collecting all of the profits of Shangri-La. Those who go against the order shall be killed!”</p> <p>Looking at the furious troops and adventurers, Midhart gave a cold smile. Business in Shangri-La was booming. With only him sent to collect the money, it would definitely be a tough job. He might even be able to steal some of the crystal coins, and in a few days, he could get himself a beautiful lover back in the capital.</p> <p>In his excitement, Midhart disregarded the angry stares of the people. After forcing the Rossi people into the Terras Forest, they had basically achieved control of this town. Even if the adventurers in town were unhappy, they would not dare to do anything in the face of three thousand elite Black Armor Guards.</p> <p>Looking at the arrogant Midhart, the people clenched their teeth, all wanting to beat him into a pile of mush. But thinking about his backers, thinking about the fearsome Black Armor Guards of the Banto Empire, they did not dare act rashly. They could only be angry, but they could not voice their grievances. In their anger, no one noticed that the notice that had fanned their anger had secretly been torn down.</p> <p>“Sir, I only have a dozen Black Crystal Coins on me. Do a good deed and let me stay in Shangri-La for a few more days. As long as I can make it past these chaotic days, I will leave immediately!” Under Goode’s preparations, a pathetic troop knelt in front of Triangle Eyes, tears covering his face. “Pity my eighty-year-old mother back at home. I still have kids to rear. Please do a good deed and let me stay in Shangri-La to avoid trouble for a few days!”</p> <p>“Hah, no money?” Midhart looked at the shabbily dressed desolate soldier in disgust. He struck down with his whip without hesitation. “Scram if you have no money! This is not a refugee center, scram!”</p> <p>After letting out a pathetic wail, the desolate soldier staggered out of the inn with a bloody head. Behind him, many shook their heads in sympathy. Some clenched their teeth and stared at the arrogant Triangle Eyes. There were even some who were silently polishing the shiny axes in their hands.</p> <p>After a wave of threats, Midhart successfully collected a large number of crystal coins. When he walked out of Shangri-La smiling, he did not see the flaming eyes of the people behind him. He did not expect that he had accidentally become the gravedigger for his own faction.</p> <p>By dawn, an unprecedented storm was brewing in Wissen Town!</p> <p>Midhart had successfully accomplished his mission, but his master Steve was worried. For some reason, just a day later, the Rossi troops started a strong retaliation. They would frequently swarm up to a lone Black Armor Guard and make use of their numbers advantage to launch frenzied attacks, then vanish before reinforcements could arrive.</p> <p>In just a day, the casualties had become serious. He had lost sixty elite warriors and three patrolling Spellcasters. With the small scale ambushes, countless warriors had also become injured.</p> <p>Could it be that they had a large number of reinforcements?</p> <p>Steve was very confused. He had thought that the Rossi forces could not survive another blow and that he could gain complete control of Wissen Town ahead of schedule. He could not understand how the Rossi people could suddenly launch such a strong counterattack. What confused him even more was how the Rossi forces managed to successfully ambush one lone soldier every time.</p> <p>In the chaos, even the townspeople who had lived in Wissen Town for decades barely noticed that there were a few more giant trees at critical junctions of the town, much less Steve, who had arrived out of nowhere. No one paid attention to the sudden appearance of a few fist-sized Horned Bee Beasts on several of those trees.</p>",
  "Chapter 74: Moon Priestess": "<p>After advancing to the level of Spirit Wizard, Yang Ling’s Wizard Powers had improved drastically, allowing him to command the actions of all of his Magical Beasts within a five-kilometer radius. The Withered Tree Warriors that he had transformed into trees were like cameras, continually feeding him information from what they saw and heard. Yang Ling was able to observe the actions of all of Steve’s men without even leaving the house.</p> <p>As predicted, Yang Ling only needed to supply the Rossi troops with some critical information and material supplies like rations and weapons. After that, the arrogant leader Steve had to spend all of his effort in holding them off despite the increasing pressure of their attacks. Yang Ling did not have to mobilize a single man.</p> <p>Under the constant attacks, Steve had no choice but to order his patrol squad to narrow their radius and hope that this would keep the Rossi forces from launching as many sneak attacks. At the same time, he sent out a large number of scouts in hopes of learning about his enemies’ headquarters and overall abilities. He planned to exterminate the Rossi forces with one attack.</p> <p>Steve was incredibly worried, but Yang Ling felt completely at ease. He spent his days either training in his yard, strolling in the serene garden with Sofia, or enjoying Alice’s massages.</p> <p>Wissen Tower was large, large beyond Yang Ling’s imagination. An average garden was already as big as multiple golf courses. The refreshing air, dancing leaves, and flickering light that filtered through the foliage provided him and Sofia with a great place to meet up. Hugging the elf beauty’s slender waist, kissing her supple lips…</p> <p>Every time, at the critical moment, Sofia would push Yang Ling away decisively. The forest elves were a beautiful race. Sex before marriage might not be a big deal to humans, but to the elves, it was an unpardonable offense.</p> <p>The things you wanted but couldn’t have were the most precious!</p> <p>Yang Ling had to forcefully control his urges. But that caused the flames of his passion to burn brighter, making him more susceptible to outside influences. Sometimes, while Alice was gently massaging his thigh, his nether region would immediately grow erect. He could not hide it even after draping himself with a thick blanket, making it incredibly awkward.</p> <p>Every time Alice saw Yang Ling’s private area standing tall, her face would turn red in shame. She would be fifteen after the winter was over. Even though she was still a little clueless about the birds and the bees, she had some understanding of the differences between a man and a woman.</p> <p>When she first started serving Yang Ling, all she wanted was to repay his kindness in saving her grandfather. But after she got to know Yang Ling better, she began to enjoy the time she got to spend with him. She would naturally smile when Yang Ling was happy. She would feel a wave of sadness whenever Yang Ling creased his brows.</p> <p>At some point, she started seeing Yang Ling’s figure in her dreams.</p> <p>Sometimes, she would dream of Yang Ling in a flowing white robe, hugging her as they rode on the snow white Unicorn, galloping in the wind. Sometimes, she would dream of Yang Ling hugging her slender waist, strolling with her in the garden that he and Sofia frequented. In fact, there would even be times where she would dream of Yang Ling holding her tightly like he held Sofia and kissing her gently on her soft earlobes…</p> <p>While she was serving Yang Ling, Alice would frequently become distracted. Yang Ling did not think too much about it after chiding her several times. In his eyes, Alice was still a young girl, a gentle, kind young girl.</p> <p>This night, leaning in Yang Ling’s embrace as she looked at the hazy waning moon, Sofia let out a distant sigh. “Brother Yang, this year is the Year of the Ice Moon that happens once a century. My grandfather wants me to attend the selection for the Moon Priestess. I will have no choice but to leave you for some time!”</p> <p>Moon Priestess?</p> <p>Yang Ling had been about to plant a soft kiss on Sofia’s forehead, but after hearing this, he paused. Even though he had been in this foreign world for some time, he was still rather unfamiliar with the customs, races, and unusual abilities that existed here. In comparison, he was more familiar with the classifications and abilities of the more common Magical Beasts.</p> <p>Seeing that Yang Ling was confused, Sofia began to explain.</p> <p>It turned out that there were countless intelligent races such as the elves, dwarves, humans, giants, and orcs on the Tailun Continent. After thousands of years of war, the humans had emerged victorious and taken control of a large portion of the continent’s land and resources. The other races that withdrew into the forests had at most a hundred thousand people, and some races had only a few thousand or even a few hundred members remaining.</p> <p>Even though the humans were by no means exceptional when they were born, they could learn powerful magical spells and Battle Energy later in their lives, and they could generally be split into two occupations—warriors and spellcasters. Warriors were split into Knights, Swordsmen, Great Swordsmen, and Swords Saints. Spellcasters could be split into Apprentices, Spellcasters, Great Spellcasters, and Magical Tutors. Each stage could be further divided into three levels—beginner, intermediate, and high.</p> <p>Over the millennia, the humans had ranked the abilities of Magical Beasts into levels from one to nine. Those with abilities higher than level nine were all consolidated and classified as saint level. According to estimates, a high level Swordsman had abilities equivalent to a level three Magical Beast, and a high level Great Swordsman had abilities equal to a level six Magical Beast. Only Sword Saints and Magical Tutors at the peak of their abilities had the power to challenge level nine Magical Beasts. It was rumored that only a powerful fighter who had the strength to affect the environment around him could challenge the fabled saint level Magical Beasts.</p> <p>The humans had powerful abilities, but at the same time, the other races also had unique abilities passed down through the millennia. The orcs were naturally hardy and violent, elves were masters of natural magic and archery, dwarves had powerful physical attacks… Basically, each of the races had abilities that they were proud of that had stubbornly been passed down despite the threat of the humans and Magical Beasts.</p> <p>“Sofia, then what do you think of my abilities?” Yang Ling was a little curious, having heard Sofia’s explanation.</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, Sofia creased her brows and said in a roundabout way, “Brother Yang, as a rarely seen Ancient Summoner, as long as you have your Magical Beast army protecting you, even a beginner level Sword Saint would not be able to easily defeat you, much less a Great Swordsman. But if you are unable to call out your Magical Beasts to do battle for you in time, even a beginner level Great Swordsman might be able to launch a successful sneak attack on you, so you have to be careful in the future!”</p> <p>I’m weaker than a beginner level Great Swordsman?</p> <p>Thinking back to the high level Great Swordsman Batiste and his soaring Battle Energy, then thinking about the terrifying Heaven-ranked Assassin, Yang Ling shook his head and laughed bitterly. Sofia was right. A Blood Wizard had no battle abilities other than being able to tame Magical Beasts. Even though he had advanced to the level of Spirit Wizard, the only offensive capability he had was his small collection of Wizard Amulets. Luckily, his constitution had been improved multiple times, making him nimble and dexterous. Otherwise, he might have already met with misfortune.</p> <p>“Sofia, then what did you mean when you spoke about the Moon Priestess?”</p> <p>“Moon Priestesses are the pride of the elves, having received the great blessings of the Goddess of Nature. Even though their abilities aren’t very strong in the beginning, their advantage lies in the speed of their advancement. They not only boost the offensive capabilities of their allies, they can even summon meteor showers that fall from the sky. They are immensely powerful!” Sofia was filled with pride when she spoke about Moon Priestesses.</p> <p>She went on to explain that the priestesses of the elf tribe were divided into Wind Priestesses, War Priestesses, and Staff Priestesses, and each stage was further divided into high, intermediate, and beginner levels. A Moon Priestess was a Soul Priestess who had received the blessing of the Goddess of Nature. They not only had a high speed of advancement, but they also had several unique abilities.</p> <p>And they were rare; there could only be one Moon Priestess born every century!</p> <p>“Brother Yang, it will take three months to a year when I head to the Divine Temple this time. You have to wait for me to return!” Sofia’s eyes were red when she leaned on Yang Ling’s broad chest.</p> <p>“No, I’m sorry, I can’t wait!” Leaning on Sofia’s supple skin, looking at her fair neck, taking a whiff of her faint fragrance, Yang Ling felt his blood course through him faster. After taking a deep breath, he feigned regret and shook his head.</p> <p>Can’t wait?</p> <p>Could Brother Yang have another woman?</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, Sofia became anxious and angry, tears welling in her eyes. If not for the members of her tribe, she would not have been able to bear to leave Yang Ling, the person she thought about day and night. But hearing him say this, she could not help but feel even more dejected.</p> <p>“Haha, you clinging to me this tightly is tempting me to commit a crime!” Seeing Sofia tearing up, Yang Ling quickly kissed her forehead. “I can’t wait anymore, I want to let you taste my power!”</p> <p>Clinging to him this tightly?</p> <p>Feeling the bulge in Yang Ling’s pants, Sofia quickly understood what he meant by “can’t wait anymore.” Her face reddened, and she turned to run after giving him a playful glare. She was worried that she would become reluctant to leave if she stayed for a moment longer.</p>",
  "Chapter 75: Schemes": "<p>A hundred or so miles east of Wissen Town, there was a forested area filled with towering trees and thorny vines. There were no traces of humans. Even the hunters of the town rarely went there, much less the loggers.</p> <p>But, as the sun set, many dark shadows flickered through this desolate area. They were like condors gliding over the snow-covered ground, only leaving behind a faint string of footprints, quickly covered by the accumulating snow.</p> <p>Leaping over some shrubs and confirming that no one was following them, the black shadows who were dressed like warriors crawled into a small space under a piece of granite. A wave of cold air laced with snowflakes blew past, covering any evidence of their passage, from their scents to their footprints.</p> <p>Behind the granite slab was a giant natural cave with many sharp stalactites. The ground was freezing, covered with a thick layer of ice.</p> <p>“Lord, I was lucky. I have managed to obtain the latest information about the distribution of manpower and the patrol routes of the Banto forces!” After crawling into a dark green tent, the leading warrior knelt before a young man sitting comfortably in a large chair. He took out a thin piece of hide from within his robes and handed it over to an armed guard.</p> <p>“Silom, if I remember correctly, you are currently still a baron?” The young man leaning on the chair took the thin hide and looked at the still wet ink, then paused and said, “I hear that there is still an undeveloped piece of land in the Luya Valley. You have served me for this many years; it’s about time you have a piece of land you can rule over!”</p> <p>Land I can rule over?</p> <p>“Thank you, Lord, for your generosity!” The warrior called Silom was elated to hear the offer.</p> <p>According to the customs of the Tailun Continent, a baron held a title but no authority. They were not granted land, nor could their titles be passed on to their descendants. Only after being conferred the title of viscount were they given the authority to rule over land and the right to pass down their titles, truly stepping into the circle of nobles.</p> <p>Even though the Luya Valley was at the southern tip of the empire and was called the Land of Wilderness, Silom was still incredibly excited. Advancing directly to the title of viscount was very, very rare.</p> <p>“Silom, that is the reward you deserve!” Seeing the excited Silom, the opulently dressed young man let out a reserved smile. He then looked at the rest of the envious warriors and said slowly, “We came to Wissen Town in secret to execute a difficult mission. But as long as we successfully complete the mission, each and every one of you will be heavily rewarded!”</p> <p>“Thank you for taking care of us, Lord!” Silom would become a true noble once he returned home. Seeing that, the rest of the warriors were also excited and filled with hope. It was rumored that the lord was a generous man. It looked like that was true indeed.</p> <p>“Silom, how are the negotiations going on the rations and armor?”</p> <p>“Lord, this…” Silom was a little hesitant. He paused for a moment before clenching his teeth and saying, “Lord, the other party is being too shameless. He asks for five hundred Purple Crystal Coins for a cart of barley. Even an arrow costs ten Purple Crystal Coins. These rates are ten times above the average price, so…”</p> <p>Silom was covered in sweat as he looked at his leader, whose expression never showed what he was feeling. Silom had just received an unexpected conferment. If he ignited the fury of the lord because of his failure to negotiate the rations and armor, he wouldn’t just lose his conferment, he might even have to be subjected to harsh punishment. After all, in the vast Rossi Empire, this Lord’s strictness was as famous as his generosity.</p> <p>It was rumored that once, the Lord took along a personal guardsman when he visited a minister. Before they went, he instructed his guard to change into formal attire. In the end, because the guard was rushing for time, he had not polished a small patch of dirt on the third button of his shirt, to the displeasure of the lord. For this offense, the unlucky guard had been sent to the army to wash the clothes of the soldiers for a whole year!</p> <p>“Oh, does the other party require crystal coins?” Seeing Silom nervous and covered in sweat, the lord’s expression did not change. He had been by his father’s side for many years, and the thing that he had learned best was the technique to command his subordinates.</p> <p>A hundred Purple Crystal Coins might be an astronomical sum to an average person, but to the Rossi Empire and its expanse of land and citizens, even tens of thousands of coins was a small sum. At such a critical moment, the lord did not care that he had to fork out more crystal coins. He was more worried about Yang Ling’s motive for supporting them in the first place.</p> <p>Just like Steve, the lord had also become very interested in Yang Ling and how he had become the main powerhouse in the town. Even though the lord had expended a great deal of effort, he was unable to find any clues regarding Yang Ling’s background.</p> <p>After the pitched battles in the town, the lord had seen that he was not Steve’s match and led his subordinates into the Terras Forest to hide. Terras Forest, being the continent’s largest primordial forest, spanned tens of thousands of miles and was covered with Magical Beasts and towering. Steve would not be able to track them within a forest this dense even if he had an army of thirty thousand, much less the three thousand he currently possessed.</p> <p>Indeed, after seeking refuge in Terras Forest, the lord quickly seized the initiative, frequently setting out to ambush the patrolling Banto soldiers, inflicting heavy casualties on Steve’s forces. In his rush to arrive at Wissen Town, the lord had only brought a little over five hundred men. However, all of them were elites who could hold off ten fighters alone; in one on one fights, Steve’s Black Armor Guards were no match for them.</p> <p>Even though the lord had seized the initiative the moment he started acting from the shadows, the gradually dipping temperatures had caused him more and more trouble. He did not have rations or a way to replace damaged weapons and arrows, nor did he have enough priests and medicine. In fact, the warriors did not even have winter clothing that could ward off the cold. He was losing more men to the elements than to battle.</p> <p>Just as he was left with no options, Yang Ling’s tactician had visited him without an invitation. The tactician took great risks to sell him various material resources, even information. That made him elated, and both parties arrived at an agreement instantly.</p> <p>“Lord, we didn’t meet Sir Yang the last time we infiltrated Wissen Town.” Sometime later, seeing that the lord did not break into a fury, Silom let out a sigh of relief. “But according to his tactician Goode, Sir Yang wishes to meet you in person!”</p> <p>“Oh, meet me in person?”</p> <p>The lord’s expression remained unchanged as he looked silently at his personal tactician. The latter had started to open his mouth, but he understood the lord’s glance and closed his mouth after seeing the warriors kneeling on the ground.</p> <p>“You all have worked hard. Go back and rest!”</p> <p>“Thank you, Lord!” After paying their respects, Silom and the rest left quickly. Silom only realized that he was covered in cold sweat after he left the opulent tent.</p> <p>After ascertaining that Silom and the rest had left, the tactician hidden in the shadows said softly, “Lord, even if Yang Ling hadn’t requested this, I would still think that we need to personally meet Yang Ling!”</p> <p>“Really?” The lord gently shook his head. Yang Ling had a mysterious and powerful Magical Beast army, a large group of loyal followers, and crystal coins that he seemed to be able to spend as he wished. Coupled with his mysterious background, a person like this would definitely not be bought over with just a few crates of crystal coins or a few beautiful ladies.</p> <p>“Lord, everyone has their desires and weaknesses!” Seeing the lord shake his head, the tactician hidden in the shadows understood his line of thought. “Yang Ling is taking a huge risk in helping us. His family might be torn apart if he is not careful. Why exactly is he doing this?”</p> <p>After a pause, seeing the lord staring off into space, the tactician continued softly, “According to Yang Ling’s tactician, he is helping us because Steve destroyed his bar and wine refinery. But that reason is surface level. The deeper reason is because Steve’s sudden appearance stole his developmental space and core benefits!”</p> <p>Developmental space and core benefits?</p> <p>After deliberating for a moment, the lord nodded in understanding. He knew that his tactician was right. “Maitermant, how should we bring this local powerhouse under our wing and foil the battle strategies of the Banto Empire?”</p> <p>“Lord, it is actually very simple; there’s a way to not only satisfy Yang Ling’s request but also greatly benefit the Rossi Empire!” Maitermant paused for a moment, then whispered, “I think that you would definitely be happy that you have an enclave behind the Banto Empire!”</p> <p>An enclave?</p> <p>After his surprise, the lord was elated. If he recognized Yang Ling as the leader of Wissen Town, it would not only satisfy Yang Ling’s aspirations and requests, it could also bring about immense benefits to the lord’s empire. The significance or the move ran even deeper than just foiling the battle strategies of the Banto Empire. Of course, after all was said and done, his position in his father’s heart would solidify even further, giving him the upper hand in the struggle for the throne.</p>",
  "Chapter 76: Turbulent Feelings of the Townspeople": "<p>With the intentional provocation, Steve, who had no choice but to be ruthless and violent due to his lack of rations and clothing, became the public enemy. The Black Armor Guards under him also became the target of the people’s hatred and acts of revenge. Small scale conflict targeting the Black Armor Guards became more and more frequent. The situation did not improve even after Steve increased the strength and radius of his patrol squad.</p> <p>Slowly, the relationship between the Black Armor Guards and the rest of the people became increasingly tense. The people walked quickly on the streets, worried that they would suddenly meet with mishap. They would also close their doors and windows the moment the sky got dark. At the same time, the Black Armor Guards were also afraid of getting ambushed, and they traveled in large groups even when they were headed to the bar to get a drink. No one dared to act alone.</p> <p>There was a joke circulating within the internal command of the Black Armor Guards. They had to move with their brothers no matter the time and place. They patrolled the streets together, went to the toilet together, flirted with girls together. They even had to move in pairs when they wanted to find a woman. One would be enjoying himself while the other would guard him with heavy arms, in case someone from the Rossi Empire suddenly charged in.</p> <p>At the same time, Yang Ling recalled all of the guards in his patrol squad, consolidating his forces and strengthening the defense of Wissen Castle. In order to ease the worries of the servants whose families were in Wissen Town, Yang Ling had decided to bring their families into the castle temporarily. This way, his servants and subordinates became even more grateful, putting even more effort into fulfilling their duties.</p> <p>For example, Madam Liss was in charge of sweeping the floor. In the past, she would only wipe the floor once every day. But now, she would voluntarily wipe the floor thrice a day even without the old butler Murbaqi’s instructions. Madam Penny, who was in charge of purchasing groceries, would praise Sir Yang every time she went to the market to purchase groceries, much to the envy of the rest of the townspeople. They would often ask if there were any vacancies in Yang Ling’s abode.</p> <p>The days passed, but the situation in Wissen Town did not improve. Instead, it became more and more tense!</p> <p>With the increasing number of Black Armor Guards falling to ambushes, and with the weather getting colder and colder, the Black Armor Guards who lacked clothing and rations became increasingly violent, and their discipline degraded. One day, just as Yang Ling was leaning back on his large chair and enjoying Alice’s massage, his guard Argus walked in with large steps.</p> <p>“Sir, the bar owner Andrew, the blacksmith, and the rest of the people came to pay you a visit!”</p> <p>“Invite them in!” Yang Ling sat up straight. “Alice, you must be tired. Go and rest. The weather is so cold, you need to be careful not to get sick, especially since you are wearing this little clothing!”</p> <p>Seeing the thin robe draped over Alice’s skinny shoulders, Yang Ling shook his head. He then draped his own leopard skin coat over her. Alice quickly snuggled into the warm coat after giving a soft reply.</p> <p>Alice had just left when a flurry of footsteps came from outside the door. Looking up, Yang Ling saw Argus leading in a large group of people. Other than Andrew, the blacksmith, and the rest of the people, there were also several strangers. There were men and women, young and old, totaling upwards of a hundred people.</p> <p>Yang Ling was surprised by the sudden appearance of over a hundred people, but their expressions shocked him even more. Some had blank expressions and were mumbling, as if they were suffering from dementia. Some had sunken expressions, their muscles rigid, as if someone owed them five hundred thousand dollars. A few people began weeping softly the moment they saw Yang Ling, as if they were seeing a relative they had not seen for many years…</p> <p>“Andrew, what’s going on?” After seating the group, Yang Ling instructed his servants to serve them tea before asking Andrew who was seated closest to him.</p> <p>“Sir, we cannot survive like this!” Andrew clenched his teeth and said fiercely, “A few days ago, you lent me a sum of crystal coins to purchase land and build an inn. I picked out a decent location two days ago and was prepared to pay and begin construction. But as I left my house yesterday morning, all of the crystal coins were snatched away by a group of Black Armor Guards. They even broke two of my ribs!”</p> <p>Andrew pulled up his shirt, revealing the ugly black and purple bruises on his skin. He was coughing continuously, as if his injuries were rather serious.</p> <p>They broke two of his ribs?</p> <p>Looking closely at Andrew’s injuries, Yang Ling’s expression sank. Andrew was already in his fifties. He could easily develop complications after being beaten up like this, even if he had been given timely treatment. It looked like the Black Armor Guards under Steve were becoming more and more insolent, for them to lay such a heavy hand on a defenseless old man.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling was about to console Andrew when a young lady dressed in rough clothing charged out and knelt before him.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, when my father returned from hunting, the Black Armor Guards accused him of supplying the Rossi forces with information and beat him badly. He has been lying on the bed for more than a week, unable to get up. His injuries are getting more and more serious, and if he doesn’t receive treatment soon, I’m afraid…” The young lady’s face was covered in tears as she looked at Yang Ling. “Sir Yang, please save my father, I’m begging you!”</p> <p>Looking at the crying, pitiful girl named Kristin, Yang Ling shook his head. It looked like the Black Armor Guards under Steve had become paranoid after suffering such heavy casualties. They even beat up an ordinary hunter for being the spy for the Rossi soldiers.</p> <p>“Miss Kristin, please get up!” Yang Ling reached out to the kneeling girl and helped her up. “Do not worry, I’ll immediately send someone to treat your father. Don’t worry, it’ll be alright!”</p> <p>Yang Ling shot a glance toward Argus as he spoke. The latter understood his intentions and quickly helped the grieving Kristin to a chair by the side.</p> <p>Following that, seeing how Yang Ling accepted the young lady’s request so readily, the rest of the people started voicing their grievances.</p> <p>Some said that the rations they had saved up for the winter had been snatched away by the Black Armor Guards and that they had no more food left for the days ahead. Some said that their family members went to hunt in the Terras Forest, but were captured by the Black Armor Guards and accused of being spies. In fact, there were some who claimed that their daughters had been humiliated by a group of drunk Black Armor Guards, and they were asking Yang Ling to help them find justice.</p> <p>“Sir, if this goes on, there is no way we can carry on living!” Seeing Yang Ling remaining silent while the rest of the people voiced their grievances, Andrew spoke as he knelt on the ground.</p> <p>“That’s right, Sir Yang, please save us!”</p> <p>“Sir Yang, as long as you lead us, we will go all out against them and kill the blasted beasts!”</p> <p>“That’s right! That nonsense leader Steve is just a thief! Other than Sir Yang, no one else is worthy of being our leader. All of us will fight for you!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The people became more agitated as they spoke, pointing their spears toward the leader Steve. They were all pleading for Yang Ling to help them seek justice, hoping that Yang Ling would exterminate Steve’s faction just like he had the Anca family. In their eyes, if Wissen Town were to have a leader, it had to be Yang Ling.</p> <p>“All of you, I am sorry, but I am just a small merchant. I do not have the ability, nor is there a possibility that I would go against Sir Leader.”</p> <p>Yang Ling coldly rejected the requests of the people. The situation now was tense, and who knew if Steve had spies amongst the townspeople. He did not want to leave behind something that could be used against him in the hands of the Black Armor Guards who were ready to attack.</p> <p>Furthermore, there was still not a clear victor between Steve and the Rossi forces. If he were to act now, he would have to pay a price even if he achieved victory, giving a free advantage to the Rossi forces in the forest. It was smarter for him to deal the fatal blow when both armies were at their weakest.</p> <p>“Sir…” Seeing Yang Ling refuse them, the people knelt in disappointment. There was no way they could continue living their lives if they allowed Steve’s Black Armor Guards to continue acting this way.</p> <p>“People, I am very sympathetic to your plight!” Yang Ling’s eyes moved as he thought of an idea. He said, “I am unable to help in certain areas, but if you truly cannot live on, you can talk to my butler and collect some rations and clothes to ward off the cold. In fact, if any of you feel uneasy, you can move into my castle temporarily!”</p> <p>Move into the castle temporarily?</p> <p>When they heard Yang Ling say this, the crowd had a glint in their eyes, finally seeing a ray of light. Yang Ling had powerful abilities. The Black Armor Guards would not dare act rashly within the castle, even if they had the gall of a bear.</p> <p>The people were elated. Yang Ling also let out a faint smile. Obtaining the gratitude and support of the people would be immensely beneficial for his future plans, and the price he had to pay was merely some rations and a few empty guest rooms. If he planned this right, he might be able to further profit from this.</p>",
  "Chapter 77: Return to Spider Valley": "<p>Faced with the increasingly lawless harassment of the Black Armor Guards, coupled with Yang Ling’s promise, the townspeople brought their daughters into Wissen Castle for the time being, to protect them from getting violated by the Black Armor Guards. Within a short span of time, there were slender and supple young ladies all around Wissen Castle. Luckily, there were many villas within the castle; otherwise, the young ladies would’ve been forced to sleep on the floor.</p> <p>As a precaution, Yang Ling took Goode’s suggestion and placed a large notice outside Shangri-La and the castle. The notice explained that winter had arrived and the castle needed large-scale cleaning and restoration work, so a large number of female workers were being hired. That was used to address any doubts that Steve and the Black Armor Guards under him might have.</p> <p>With the influx of people over such a short span of time, coupled with the fact that Yang Ling had to frequently help the townspeople who were experiencing hardship, the abode began to exhaust a large amount of rations every day. Luckily, Yang Ling had stockpiled a large amount of dry rations before winter, not to mention the heaps of food in the Anca family grain storage. There were still no worries that rations would run out.</p> <p>With this much manpower, Yang Ling decided to construct a wine refinery within the castle. Even though the Evening Primrose Bar and the wine refinery had been trashed by the troublemaking Black Armor Guards, the winemakers and builders were all unharmed. Under the old butler Murbaqi’s command, wafts of fragrant wine scents soon filled the air within the castle. The dwarf Rumi could finally drink his fill again.</p> <p>The situation within Wissen Town was chaotic. Yang Ling had thought that he might be able to recoup the cost of supporting so many people by using the free labor to set up a small bar within Shangri-La. But he did not expect business to be this unusually booming. Since the lawless Black Armor Guards had dramatically cut down the job opportunities available to the people, many troops and adventurers had nothing to do and opted to drown their sorrows in alcohol. They would drink until they were drunk every day, giving Yang Ling a profit of many crystal coins.</p> <p>Under the influence of the alcohol, the intense hatred of the furious townspeople rose. Many of them stalked the Black Armor Guards and stabbed any of them that fell behind in the group. The corpses of Black Armor Guards were frequently discovered at crossroads, in dark corners, or under the trees by the roadside.</p> <p>In the beginning, Steve made a big deal about this and ordered his army to search every house for the murderers. But when the soldiers were unable to arrest the murderers each time, the lower ranked officials could only push the blame onto the untraceable Rossi forces in order to soothe Steve’s fury. This way, Steve could not control the situation despite all the effort he put into it. The situation became more and more chaotic.</p> <p>At the same time, attracted by the mesmerizing alcohol, many Black Armor Guards also visited Shangri-La for a few drinks. But faced with the heavily armored barbarian guards wielding tire-sized axes, coupled with the animosity of the troops and adventurers, none of them dared to cause any trouble.</p> <p>In the previous fight at the Evening Primrose Bar, the Black Armor Guards had managed to injure two of the barbarians severely, but they lost more than twenty of their own in the process. An additional five of the Black Armor Guards had succumbed to their injuries five days later. The Black Armor Guards were lawless, but they weren’t suicidal. They now knew how powerful the barbarians were, and they would not dare cause any trouble in front of the barbarians unless they assembled the entirety of their army.</p> <p>There was an incident where a drunken Black Armor Guard succumbed to his bestial desires and tried to molest an elf lady in public. The results were predictable; the soldier was beaten to a pulp by the violent barbarians, his teeth falling everywhere. After a few hundred Black Armor Guards heard the news and rushed over, they didn’t dare to attack when they saw the bloodthirsty barbarians.</p> <p>When he was dragged back to the camp, the severely beaten lad did not know his place and complained to Steve. The soldier claimed that Yang Ling was harboring Rossi soldiers within Shangri-La, and he suggested that they should mobilize the entire army to investigate Shangri-La. In the end, he got kicked into the air by the angered Steve.</p> <p>Steve had been filled with confidence when he took the helm in Wissen Town. He thought that with his own abilities and his three thousand Black Armor Guards, he would be able to consolidate his rule rapidly, and perhaps even send the first shipment of resources to the king as early as the following spring.</p> <p>It was only after he arrived in Wissen Town that he discovered how dire the situation truly was. Not only did the Rossi forces rush in to sabotage his plans, a large portion of Wissen Town’s people and troops were unwilling to accept him as their leader.</p> <p>After he realized that he could not settle this as fast as he wished to, he had to increase the intensity of the taxes he collected because of his lack of supplies. The situation was becoming increasingly grim. Eventually, everyone from the neutral troops from the Livenza Alliance to the ordinary townspeople started viewing him as an enemy.</p> <p>Given how many of his men were dying, Steve knew that the assassinations and ambushes had nothing to do with the Rossi soldiers. Someone else was manipulating these events from the shadows. But in such a tight spot, he was lucky just to extort some money from Yang Ling. If he had a real falling out with Yang Ling, he would be basically digging his own grave. He would not be so foolish even without the reminders of his tacticians.</p> <p>Whenever he had nothing to do, Yang Ling would also make his rounds around Shangri-La. Casey would arrange for a group of warriors to accompany him every time he left the castle. Yang Ling had spoken of this many times, but both Goode and the old butler Murbaqi were adamant that he should not leave alone. Because of this, large groups of guards frequently appeared within Shangri-La. The Black Armor Guards, even more so, did not dare cause trouble within.</p> <p>This day, after training for an entire night, Yang Ling felt his Wizard Powers approaching a bottleneck. He could probably become a high level Spirit Wizard if he were to charge past this hurdle. When that happened, the speed and radius that he could tame Magical Beasts would increase. He estimated that he would be able to tame a few intermediate to high level Magical Beasts without even using Magical Beast Blood Orbs.</p> <p>In this dog-eat-dog world, increasing one’s abilities was the most important thing to do!</p> <p>After giving Goode a few instructions, Yang Ling returned to Terras Forest. He wanted to recall the spider army into the Wizard’s Pagoda to await orders, and then he could silently train within the forest for a few days. Achieving a breakthrough in his Wizard Powers would be difficult for the time being, but absorbing a large amount of green life force would be beneficial to him.</p> <p>Riding the speedy Unicorn and using the Horned Bee Beasts as scouts, he managed to silently evade the scouts of the Black Armor Guards along the way, arriving at Spider Valley a few hours later.</p> <p>Unlike the last time he was there, the entrance of Spider Valley was covered in traps, with poisonous spider webs covering the area and scouts hiding under the ground. In the valley, countless spiders were skittering around.</p> <p>Some of the spiders were the size of basins, their bodies covered with long black hair. Some were very speedy, their bodies white. Other spiders used their tough spider webs to glide from one tree to the next. It looked like the Tarantula King had led its army to conquer several other spider tribes in this span of time, greatly improving their abilities.</p> <p>The transformation in Spider Valley was drastic, but Yang Ling was even more shocked when he saw the giant Tarantula King.</p> <p>The Tarantula King’s nine eyes had changed from sky blue to a blood red. The red hair on its body stood straight like arrows, a ferocious sight. Furthermore, the spider guards behind it had all grown to the size of basins and were in a sharp triangular formation. Looking at the cluster, it looked as though they were a sharp, blood red arrowhead.</p> <p>Fatal poison, sharp poisonous fangs, and ambushes that were hard to guard against. Coupled with their clear organization and complete lack of fear, the spiders were more of a butcher’s knife, a sharp butcher’s knife, than a Magical Beast army.</p> <p>Looking at the bloodthirsty spider army, Yang Ling was incredibly shocked. He realized that he finally had a true Magical Beast army. Even though a lone spider was not exceptional, these tens of thousands of spiders attacking in formation would be a nightmare for his enemies. Yang Ling hadn’t expected the spider army to undergo such a drastic transformation in such a short amount of time under the leadership of the Tarantula King. He also couldn’t imagine what kind of drastic change the Horned Bee Beasts, Evil Eyes, and Withered Tree Warriors would have if they had such a champion leading them.</p>",
  "Chapter 78: Extraordinary Ability of the Tree Eyes": "<p>Even though the spiritual energy within Terras Forest grew richer the deeper into the forest he went, Yang Ling was unwilling to delve too deeply into the forest for safety’s sake. He chose a small valley near the Spider Valley with enough spiritual energy to train.</p> <p>According to the memories of the Unicorn, there were many high level Magical Beasts roaming deep within the forest, and danger filled every corner. Yang Ling did not dare to be careless, since even the Unicorn had to be cautious in such places. He might be able to escape or achieve a minor victory if he encountered a high level Magical Beast using his massive Magical Beast army, but exhausting his resources at this point in time would definitely be asking for death. The gain would not outweigh the loss, even if he were lucky enough to tame a high level Magical Beast.</p> <p>Retrieving over two hundred Essence Crystals from within his Space Ring, Yang Ling set up a simple Maze Formation at the entrance of the valley, then summoned his entire Magical Beast army to protect him.</p> <p>At his command, the Withered Tree Warriors quickly turned into large trees, blockading the narrow entrance of the valley in case some Magical Beast passing by charged in after picking up Yang Ling’s scent.</p> <p>The Evil Eyes took up formation in the middle of the valley and were in charge of mid to long range attacks. The Tarantula King led its army to set up spider webs as traps all around the valley, then they quickly dug into the ground and to lay in ambush. They were in charge of low altitude defense and close-range combat.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts were split into five teams. One team was sent to patrol outside the valley, while the other four put up a strong defense within the valley at all four points of the compass. They were in charge of high altitude defense, aerial attacks, and long-range ambushes. As for the level eight Magical Beast, the Unicorn, it was tasked to stay by Yang Ling’s side and defend him.</p> <p>The valley was easy to defend, but hard to attack. With the simple yet practical Maze Formation, coupled with the Magical Beast army ready to attack, Yang Ling believed that he would be able to hold off even a high level Magical Beast. Even if he were to fail, he could instruct the Magical Beast army to defend his back while he escaped with the speedy Unicorn.</p> <p>After sitting cross-legged, Yang Ling took in a deep breath and slowly circulated the Wizard Power within his body as he recited the mysterious psychic mantra. Slowly, the thick spiritual energy entered his body. The trees surrounding him also released bolts of green life force.</p> <p>Recently, the elf elder had been trying his best to procure Water from the Spring of Life, but he had only managed to gather two bottles. Because he understood how valuable and precious the Water from the Spring of Life was, Yang Ling was reluctant to use it casually. Yang Ling planned to rely on the Magical Beast Blood Orbs rather than the Water from the Spring of Life to aid in his continual advancement.</p> <p>Unlike the Water from the Spring of Life, the effects of the Magical Beast Blood Orbs were far from ideal, but they had the advantage of availability. He could not only purchase a large number of them from the troops and hunters, he could also instruct his Magical Beast army or guards to hunt Magical Beasts for him.</p> <p>He had sufficient Magical Beast Blood Orbs, but the power they offered was tiny compared to the green life force being released by the trees. Terras Forest spanned tens of thousands of miles, and there were countless thousand-year-old ancient trees, much less hundred-year-old ones. As long as he trained within Terras Forest for a few days, he would be able to absorb a large amount of green life force.</p> <p>Even though he had not fully understood the mysteries of the green life force, Yang Ling believed that absorbing a large amount of that energy would definitely be beneficial to him. It could hasten the speed of his training, allow him to recover the Wizard Power he exhausted quickly, and even help him heal if he got injured. Even more miraculously, it seemed as though the mysterious space containing the Wizard’s Pagoda became even bigger when his green life force got richer.</p> <p>The space that contained the Wizard’s Pagoda was where his Magical Beast army resided. Without this mysterious space, he would be unable to summon his Magical Beasts to aid him in battle no matter how many he tamed or how powerful the beasts he tamed were. Yang Ling knew that without this mysterious space, he was basically a sergeant that did not hold any authority.</p> <p>Under the effects of the psychic spell, the amount of green life force released by the trees around Yang Ling became greater. Slowly, a pale green fog formed within the valley, gradually becoming thicker.</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Yang Ling felt his mind clear. Massive amounts of spiritual energy and green life force entered his body. The fog-like green energy welled into his body through all of his pores.</p> <p>As the massive amount of spiritual energy entered his body, it was converted into a raging, blood red Wizard Power. Everywhere it passed, his muscles expanded dramatically, then suddenly contracted before expanding again, forming a cycle. At the same time, the refreshing green energy followed up quickly, slowly repairing the nerves and vessels damaged by his Wizard Power.</p> <p>As the green mist in the valley got thicker, the green energy within Yang Ling’s body became richer. If it had been a small twisting stream at the start, it was now a raging river. Other than repairing the nerves and vessels damaged by the Wizard Power, the excess green energy started gathering at the center of his brow where the Wizard’s Pagoda was located, condensing as it accumulated…</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling felt as though his brain would explode from the condensing green energy, the pagoda-shaped mark between his brows suddenly jumped in excitement, its temperature rising rapidly. It quickly turned as hot as a blacksmith’s brand. Following that, without giving him time to react, the pulsing green energy within the valley coursed into the mysterious space containing the Wizard’s Pagoda through the pagoda shaped mark between his brows.</p> <p>Originally, the green fog would expand within the valley until it reached the valley’s borders, then flow over them and out into the rest of the forest. But just as the green mist started to ooze out of the valley, it rapidly coursed into the area between Yang Ling’s eyebrows. It was as if a raging flood had met a giant drain port or a bottomless hole.</p> <p>Slowly, the green mist in the valley became thinner and thinner. Even the ten-story-tall trees were no longer releasing the green life energy, much less the field grass that could be seen anywhere. At the same time, the once rich spiritual energy in the surroundings also dissipated.</p> <p>Sometime later, Yang Ling slowly woke up after a bolt of cold air laced with snowflakes blew past.</p> <p>The Wizard Power and the life force in his body were clearly separated, one red and the other green, forming two completely different streams, flowing in opposite directions within the same circulation channels. Even more miraculously, Yang Ling could sense every movement within a hundred-step-radius from himself even with his eyes closed, as if the trees around him had become his eyes and ears.</p> <p>Fifty steps away, a group of foraging ants had come across a few caterpillars that fell from a tree and were swarming forward, dragging their struggling prey back to their nest. Outside the valley, a herd of migrating Twin-horned Deers were speedily moving to the foot of the mountain where the sea level was lower, leaving behind strings of footprints in the snow-covered plains. Further away, a few shrubs were swaying amongst the cold wind. Withered leaves were falling one by one…</p> <p>After opening his eyes to observe his surroundings, Yang Ling clenched his teeth. He closed his eyes and leaped toward a nearby tree, jumping from tree to tree using just his instincts. Even though his eyes were closed, he could naturally and successfully find the best spot to plant his foot each time. He felt a natural sense of familiarity with any location that included trees, as if he had lived there since he was young.</p> <p>Eyes given by the tree spirits? Could this be a powerful mystery that a Tree Shepherd possesses within the forest?</p> <p>Yang Ling had a thought after discovering this new ability. He sat cross-legged on the ground and dragged his consciousness into the space that harbored the Wizard’s Pagoda. Indeed, this mysterious space was now several times larger than it had been the last time he visited. In fact, it seemed that even the Wizard’s Pagoda had become larger. The pictures of tigers, panthers, and even the clawed golden dragons had become even clearer.</p> <p>There was an instant when Yang Ling seemed to hear the faint roar of a dragon, as if the lifelike dragon on the pagoda was about to fly out.</p>",
  "Chapter 79: Secret of the Tarantula King": "<p>His wonderful new Tree Eye ability, his massive Magical Beast army, and his increasingly rich Wizard Power… After a moment’s surprise, Yang Ling was filled with confidence for the future. To others, the Terras Forest that spanned tens of thousands of miles might be perilous, but to him, it was an abundant land filled with riches.</p> <p>Perhaps this foreign land was more suited to him than the world he’d been born into?</p> <p>Thinking back to the time when he was poor, thinking back to the mundane nine to five life, Yang Ling had a mixture of emotions.</p> <p>When he first arrived in this foreign world, he desperately hoped to find a way back to Earth, back to the large city that he had lived in for several years. There, he had friends who could go bar hopping with him, pretty ladies who tempted him, and games such as Starcraft and Warcraft which he had played for several years without getting bored…</p> <p>But after living in this foreign world for a while, he realized that his mindset had changed.</p> <p>Here, the air was always so refreshing. Here, he did not have to squeeze onto a bus filled with people at seven o’clock in the morning. More importantly, here, he had special abilities that he had never imagined possible, and he lived a completely different life. Risky, sometimes frustrating… It was several times more exciting than the simple nine to five life he had before!</p> <p>It would be perfect if he could traverse between this mysterious world and Earth freely one day!</p> <p>Shaking his head, Yang Ling tossed away this tempting thought and recalled his Magical Beasts.</p> <p>Just like the previous time, the Magical Beasts experienced several changes after devouring a large amount of green life force. The angled wings of the Horned Bee Beasts became larger, the tentacles of the Evil Eyes became thicker, and the tree armor on the bodies of the Withered Tree Warriors became more sturdy. But the beasts that underwent the greatest transformation were the spider army led by the Tarantula King.</p> <p>At first, the appearance of the spiders did not seem to have changed. But observing closely, one would notice that their fatal poisonous fangs had become sharper. The exoskeletons on their backs also seemed to be starting to mineralize. Yang Ling tested the exoskeleton of one of the spiders with his sharp dagger. Their defensive capabilities were far from the heavy, tank-like Withered Tree Warriors, but they were definitely stronger than before.</p> <p>The spiders were equipped with a lethal poison. The fatal poison could not only attack any target on the ground, it could also snipe low flying enemies. Their attacks were very precise. Coupled with their ability to set up spider webs as traps and dig into the ground for ambushes, they were currently definitely a trump card that he could not get too many of.</p> <p>Compared to their sharp, precise attacks, their defensive capabilities were pathetic; their brittle exoskeletons were barely able to withstand a hit. If they were suddenly faced with an enemy that specialized in close combat, they would definitely suffer an utter defeat without the help of his other troops.</p> <p>Seeing that the mineralization of the spiders’ exoskeletons had doubled their defensive abilities, Yang Ling knew that he had found a shortcut to allow them to evolve quickly. Powerful offensive capability, coupled with a defense that was akin to a turtle shell, would definitely allow them to become elite forces in every sense of the word.</p> <p>Perhaps due to a bottleneck, the transformation of the ordinary spiders was obvious, but the appearance of the Tarantula King did not seem to have changed. The only surprise was that the calf-sized creature was circling around Yang Ling oddly, chittering as it walked. It seemed as though it was trying its best to express something?</p> <p>Could it be that the intelligence of the Tarantula King had been strengthened after devouring a large amount of life force?</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling had an idea as he looked at the unusual Tarantula King. He once again sat down cross-legged. He placed his right hand gently on the head of the Tarantula King and carefully inspected the situation within its body.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling was careful, the Tarantula King shuddered in pain the moment Yang Ling’s violent Wizard Power was injected into its body. Its limbs twitched slightly, its blood red eyes bulged, and its claws scratched the air ceaselessly. It howled incessantly, as if it was in great pain.</p> <p>Seeing the Tarantula King shudder, Yang Ling quickly weakened the Wizard Power he was injecting into its body. Indeed, the Tarantula King immediately showed signs of relief. But it would immediately convulse again when he increased the intensity.</p> <p>This didn’t seem to be the right method.</p> <p>Thinking back to when he had absorbed the spiritual energy and green energy from the surroundings, Yang Ling had a thought. He injected a bolt of ice cold life force into the giant spider. Indeed, the Tarantula King that was sprawled on the ground no longer struggled. In fact, it slowly started to absorb the Wizard Power and life force that were being injected into its body.</p> <p>After comparing the Tarantula King to the normal spiders, Yang Ling found that the Essence Crystal in the Tarantula King’s head was especially developed. As a low level Magical Beast, an ordinary tarantula’s Essence Crystal was only about the size of a grain of rice, and it was completely black. But the Tarantula King was different. Its Essence Crystal was not only the size of an olive, it was also blood red all over and released bolts of red light.</p> <p>Other than this, there was an oval-shaped brown pituitary gland near every spider’s Essence Crystal, continuously releasing ripples of varying sizes. Similar to the Essence Crystals, the Tarantula King’s pituitary gland was about five times larger, and it was pulsing excitedly after absorbing the green energy Yang Ling was injecting. It released waves of familiar, friendly ripples.</p> <p>Could it be that the Essence Crystal determined the abilities, while this mysterious pituitary gland determined the level of intelligence? Could a spider become a champion of their tribe if its abilities and intellect were greater than ordinary?</p> <p>Yang Ling was incredibly excited, having roughly understood the secrets behind how the Tarantula King could command the spider army. In his joy, he gradually increased the amount of Wizard Power and life force he was injecting. Indeed, the Essence Crystal of the Tarantula King slowly became larger. The ripples released by the pituitary gland also became increasingly clearer.</p> <p>The Tarantula King would convulse if there was only Wizard Power and no green life force. The Essence Crystal in its body would also tremble. If there was only the green life force and no Wizard Power, its pituitary gland would expand and contract without a rhythm, releasing messy ripples. It looked like there had to be a delicate balance in injecting Wizard Power and green life force.</p>",
  "Chapter 80: Surprise Attack": "<p>After testing the process on a dozen spiders, Yang Ling got a rough idea of how they absorbed energy. Basically, he had to inject two parts of the green life force for every part of blood red Wizard Power he injected. Around four hours later, Yang Ling had managed to forcefully evolve the ten subordinates under the Tarantula King from level two to level three.</p> <p>After the evolution, the ten spider captains grew from the size of basins to the size of small calves. Not only did their back armor get harder, their intelligence also received a significant boost. They were no longer as mechanical as they had been before. Their overall battle capabilities were still not comparable to the level four Tarantula King’s, but their leadership skills and the range and lethality of their poison were all greater than before.</p> <p>Ordinary spiders could evolve quickly, but the Tarantula King did not show any visible change even after Yang Ling spent an hour on it. It might be because it needed more energy to evolve, or there might be some other reason. Yang Ling had no choice but to give up on the tempting idea of helping the Tarantula King evolve quickly.</p> <p>Were there really no other shortcuts besides the Wizard Power and life force?</p> <p>Looking at the Tarantula King obediently sprawled before him, Yang Ling suddenly had a thought. Originally, the Tarantula King was merely an ordinary spider leader, but it evolved quickly from level two to level four after successively consuming the Essence Crystals of the other spider kings. Its battle abilities and intellect both experienced a notable improvement.</p> <p>Perhaps a champion like the Tarantula King might emerge from the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes after they consumed a few high level Essence Crystals from the same species?</p> <p>The spider army already had a leader in the Tarantula King and could adapt flexibly when they encountered an enemy. Only the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts required Yang Ling’s personal commands. Information was ever changing on the battlefield, so he might miss a grand opportunity if he acted too slowly. If the Magical Beast army was equipped with a certain level of adaptivity, the ability of the entire army would improve drastically.</p> <p>Amongst his various Magical Beasts, it was the slow-moving Evil Eyes that worried Yang Ling the most. Even though their movement speeds were faster than they were before the creatures had evolved, they were still incomparable to the Horned Bee Beasts. With their poor defensive capabilities and movement speed, the outcome would be disastrous if they were to suffer an enemy ambush on the battlefield.</p> <p>Since he was unable to help the Tarantula King evolve for the time being, Yang Ling thought about nurturing a champion from the Evil Eyes. After all, even though the weaknesses of the Evil Eyes were obvious, their strong points were even more prominent!</p> <p>Even the tank-like Withered Tree Warriors might be powerless against an enemy’s strong armor or large scales, much less the fist-sized Horned Bee Beasts. But the Evil Eyes were different. Even though a lone Evil Eye’s attack might not be too powerful, the power of tens of thousands of Evil Eyes blasting a spot with their light bullets was unparalleled. They had proved their power in the battle with the barbarians and Ymir.</p> <p>A simple three-row formation had already improved the power of the Evil Eyes to such a great extent, Yang Ling did not dare imagine what kind of battle abilities the Evil Eyes would have if they had a champion like the Tarantula King and a highly effective command structure.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling decided to return to the Valenia Valley that was rumored to be cursed. That was the place with the highest concentration of Evil Eyes. If he was lucky, he might be able to hunt a few hordes of Evil Eyes and successfully nurture a champion for the Evil Eye army within one or two days.</p> <p>With the speedy Unicorn to travel on, Yang Ling arrived at the desolate Valenia Valley in just over two hours. Snowflakes were floating in the air outside the valley, but plumes of thick smoke spouted frequently within the valley, making it hot and stuffy. The snowflakes were reduced to vapor when they got near the valley. From afar, the valley was covered in a thick fog, making it look incredibly creepy.</p> <p>In order to not alert the Evil Eyes, Yang Ling recalled the Unicorn the moment he entered the valley. He only released a team of Horned Bee Beasts to protect himself. He used his strengthened body to quickly dart through the rubble. Since his aim was the Essence Crystals of high level Evil Eyes, there was naturally no need for him to waste his time on a few low level Evil Eyes.</p> <p>The temperature of the ground rose the deeper into the valley he ventured. Luckily, since his body had been strengthened so many times, his constitution was already far from that of a normal human’s. Otherwise, he might have found it difficult to advance, with nowhere to plant his feet.</p> <p>Going deep into the Valenia Volcano Valley, he could sometimes spot an exposed Dark Fire Crystal. Unfortunately, they had too many impurities and did not meet the requirements for setting up a spell formation. But since there were this many Dark Fire Crystals on the surface, Yang Ling believed that there might be a massive crystal mine underground. He would have to find a chance to conduct a large scale excavation here in the future.</p> <p>Along the way, other than the Evil Eyes that moved in pairs, Yang Ling also came across some giant lizards that could spew fireballs from their mouths. Unfortunately, they were also slow moving, and their defensive abilities were on par with the Evil Eyes. Their attacks were also incomparable to those of the Evil Eyes, and thus Yang Ling felt that it was not worth spending his blood essence and Wizard Power to tame these creatures.</p> <p>According to the memories of the Evil Eyes he had tamed, there was a massive land basin that was covered with caves deep in the valley. It was also dotted with short shrubs, and it was a gathering place for wild Evil Eyes. Thus, Yang Ling moved quickly. Sometimes, in his hurry, he jumped from one piece of rock to another, gliding through the air like an Eber Eagle before the giant lizards blocking the way could react.</p> <p>Arriving at the land basin deep within the valley, there were indeed more and more Evil Eyes around him. He could frequently see large groups of Evil Eyes slowly moving around in search of Dark Fire Crystals or fruits that resembled pears to consume.</p> <p>Unlike other creatures, Evil Eyes did not have hands or feet. Before they evolved, they only had two tentacles, one on each side of their body. They moved using levitation techniques they were equipped with from birth, but they were different from flying creatures in that they could only float a few centimeters from the ground. If they were met with obstacles like rocks or tree roots, they had to detour around them. The speed at which they moved was very slow.</p> <p>After evolving to the second level, the Evil Eyes would develop an additional green tentacle on each side of their bodies. Its primary function was to speed up the recovery of their Magical Energy, and it didn’t have much of an effect on their movement speed. Only when they evolved to the third level and grew out another set of tentacles would their speed increase.</p> <p>After sparing a few groups of slow-moving Evil Eyes, Yang Ling set his sights on a group of Evil Eyes that were moving visibly faster. Looking over, even though he could not find a champion that stood out, he could at least spot a few Evil Eyes that had evolved to the second level. Looking at the speed of the rest of the Evil Eyes, Yang Ling estimated that they were at the later stages of the first level, much more powerful than their snail-like brethren.</p> <p>Tailing his target to the entrance of a small valley, seeing them swarm into the valley in search of food, completely oblivious to the danger behind them, Yang Ling let out a cold smile. He hid at the side and silently summoned his entire Magical Beast army.</p> <p>Even though he was confident that he would be able to quickly finish off the defenseless wild Evil Eyes if he commanded his Magical Beast army to swarm forward, Yang Ling chose to act with caution. According to the memories of the Evil Eyes he tamed, this land basin was lined with caves, some of them incredibly deep. In fact, some of the caves led to a mysterious underground city. He was not willing to unintentionally attract a large group of troublesome high level Magical Beasts when he was attacking.</p>",
  "Chapter 81: Hunt": "<p>After deliberating for a moment, Yang Ling came up with a good idea.</p> <p>Wild Evil Eyes were unorganized by nature. Not only were their movement speeds slow, their intelligence was also rather low. If he were to set up an ambush at the entrance of the valley, then command his Horned Bee Beasts and spider army to charge out from the inside, he believed that the Evil Eyes would definitely fall for the trap in their fluster.</p> <p>Under his command, the Magical Beast army acted quickly.</p> <p>The Withered Tree Warriors silently transformed into tall trees, standing guard at the exit of the valley. Behind them, the Evil Eyes got into a tight formation, taking care of the mid to long range attacks. After having evolved to the second level, their shooting range and power were better than that of their wild counterparts. With their focused firepower, sealing the exit wouldn’t be a problem for them.</p> <p>After leaving behind a team of Horned Bee Beasts in the outer perimeter of the valley as a precaution and aerial cover, Yang Ling withdrew his spider army and the rest of the Horned Bee Beasts before infiltrating the valley. With the mysterious ability of the Tree Eyes, he was able to move freely within the forest even with his eyes closed. He easily evaded the wild Evil Eyes that were foraging for food.</p> <p>Perhaps it was due to their scattered nature, or perhaps they were too complacent after finding a large amount of food, but the Evil Eyes within the valley were completely oblivious to the changes happening outside the valley. They certainly didn’t notice Yang Ling traversing the forest itself. They were completely unaware of the disaster that was about to befall them.</p> <p>After stopping in the deepest parts of the valley, Yang Ling summoned the rest of his Magical Beasts, then got onto his Unicorn. Taking in a deep breath, he instructed the army to quickly push forward, hunting and pressuring the defenseless wild Evil Eyes.</p> <p>Caught off guard and faced with the large group of fighter jet-like Horned Bee Beasts, the fatal poison of the spider army, and the purple arc-shaped lightning from the Unicorn, the wild Evil Eyes broke into pandemonium.</p> <p>Some of them hid within the shrubs. Some moved in circles as they panicked. Only a few were desperate enough to try to counter-attack. But faced with Yang Ling’s bloodthirsty army, their efforts were for naught.</p> <p>Every time a Horned Bee Beast charged, an Evil Eye fell to the attack. The Horned Bee Beasts forced the flustered Evil Eyes in the direction of the valley’s exit. Even though they could not use their giant poisonous stingers due to Yang Ling’s instructions, they were still a nightmare for the wild Evil Eyes with their lightning fast speed and sharp fangs.</p> <p>Yang Ling had confidence in the plan, so he was unwilling to waste the Horned Bee Beasts’ poisonous stingers. After all, danger lurked in every corner within Terras Forest. No one knew if they would encounter a high level Magical Beast at the next moment. Yang Ling wanted to conserve every bit of his army’s energy that he could, let alone their powerful poisonous stingers.</p> <p>Good steel has to be reserved for a sharp dagger!</p> <p>To the defenseless Evil Eyes, if the speedy Horned Bee Beasts were merciless daggers, then the spider army was basically a group of cruel demons. The Evil Eyes would immediately feel dizzy and numb when they came into contact with the poison the spiders released. Unable to dodge, they would then be torn to pieces by their sharp poisonous fangs.</p> <p>The wild Evil Eyes were unable to retaliate against the tarantulas and Horned Bee Beasts even though they were all low level Magical Beasts. They were even more defenseless against the powerful Unicorn. Some of the Evil Eyes thought that they would be able to hide amidst the chaos by diving into the shrubs, but often, a large portion of them would die after being struck by the thick bolts of lightning.</p> <p>Quickly, after observing the power of Yang Ling’s magical beast army, the wild Evil Eyes retreated, swarming toward the exit of the valley. They thought that they could escape, not even realizing that they had fallen for Yang Ling’s scheme.</p> <p>Indeed, the wild Evil Eyes that swarmed toward the exit of the valley were like moths to a flame. Compared to the Horned Bee Beasts and spider army, the Evil Eyes that were attacking in a formation were even more powerful. After waves of concentrated light bullets, flesh and blood flew everywhere around the exit of the valley. Other than the hardy Essence Crystals, even the hardest part of the wild Evil Eyes’ bodies, their skull caps, were all blasted into pieces.</p> <p>The attacks of the Evil Eyes were simple yet effective, even more so since their abilities were a full level higher than their targets’! In front of their counterparts who were in an attacking formation, the wild Evil Eyes had no chance to retaliate. Even the few who were lucky enough to survive and continue charging forward were stomped into mush by the feet of the Withered Tree Warriors.</p> <p>A massacre, it was a one-sided massacre!</p> <p>With the pincer attack from the front and the back by Yang Ling’s Magical Beast army, over a thousand wild Evil Eyes were exterminated not long after. Blood flowed like a stream within the valley, carrying with it a thick metallic stench. Bloodied tentacles could be seen everywhere.</p> <p>The quality of the troops was more important than their numbers. Having over two thousand Evil Eyes was enough, and Yang Ling was unwilling to spend more Wizard Power and blood essence on these low level troops. Thus, he allowed his Magical Beast army to attack as they wished. Unless they were wild Evil Eyes who had evolved to the third level or higher, there was no value in taming them.</p> <p>After gathering the Essence Crystals of the wild Evil Eyes, Yang Ling recalled his Magical Beast army and left the bloodied valley quickly in search of a new target. He did not know that a bunch of unsolicited visitors arrived in the valley the moment he left.</p> <p>Later, using a variety of advantageous terrains, Yang Ling successfully killed off several large groups of Evil Eyes. He had managed to collect over ten thousand Essence Crystals in a mere three days. These Essence Crystals were the size of a grain of rice and were unassuming to an average person, but to the Evil Eyes who desperately needed to evolve, they were treasures. Yang Ling needed as many as he could get.</p> <p>Just as he predicted, all of his Evil Eyes evolved to the third level after consuming a few of the Essence Crystals from the same species. Their speed not only had a notable increase, they also developed a new ability. Now, each of their attacks would carry a numbing spell.</p> <p>Yang Ling tested the new ability out. Even though the ability’s effect wasn’t as powerful as the Horned Bee Beasts’ poisonous stingers, the two abilities could be added up. The first bullet would make one a little numb, the second would make the muscles feel rigid, the third would render one completely numb… The effects would become more and more prominent the more the bullets accumulated.</p> <p>Blinding flashes of light, attacks that came with a paralytic effect, movement speed that had more than doubled… Yang Ling was full of anticipation for the Evil Eyes’ overall battle capabilities. As long as they continued to evolve, Yang Ling believed that these Magical Beasts who were trash in the eyes of an average person would become an artillery unit with massive power.</p> <p>Artillery corps in a foreign world?</p> <p>Looking at the two thousand Evil Eyes in their formation, looking at each ferocious lone eye, Yang Ling nodded in satisfaction. With their increase in level, the range of the Evil Eyes’ attacks would increase. If their attacks were comparable to bazookas now, there was a possibility that they would become long-range cannons in the future. In fact, after they evolved to level nine or the fabled saint level Magical Beast, they might become a unit that could rival China’s Second Artillery Unit.</p> <p>This world was cruel, where the strong preyed on the weak. But this world was also very exciting!</p> <p>Yang Ling noticed that he fancied more and more such a harrowing, stimulating, and exciting life! He looked forward to his abilities getting stronger and stronger. He liked to see his Magical Beasts become more and more powerful. He believed that one day, the largest primordial forest in the Tailun Continent would become his backyard.</p>",
  "Chapter 82: Ending an Entire Nest of Evil Eyes": "<p>All of the Evil Eyes had evolved to the third level. Regrettably, Yang Ling was unable to evolve the strongest Evil Eye he selected to level four even after feeding it ten Essence Crystals. He couldn’t get it to evolve into a champion like the Tarantula King.</p> <p>It looked like the difference between level three and level four was huge! Perhaps only the Essence Crystal of a high level Evil Eye could speed up the evolution process. The Tarantula King was like this too. It now no longer showed any obvious changes when it consumed the Essence Crystals of average tarantulas. It was only affected when it consumed the Essence Crystal of a tarantula that was at the same or a higher level than itself.</p> <p>Since he was already deep within Valenia Valley where the Evil Eyes gathered, Yang Ling could not bear to miss the opportunity. He continued searching for suitable targets within the land basin. But regrettably, even Evil Eyes who had naturally evolved to level two were incredibly rare, much less level three. As for level four Evil Eyes, he did not even get a glimpse of one in all his days of searching.</p> <p>Caves laced the land basin. Some of them branched out like rat nests, while some were deep beyond imagination, without an end in sight even after hours of walking. They were sinister, like bottomless pits that led straight to hell. Yang Ling did not dare go to deep within them, even with his many Magical Beasts protecting him.</p> <p>Other than the Evil Eyes and the giant, fire-breathing lizards, Yang Ling would sometimes encounter colorful, centipede-like bugs. Even though their offensive capabilities were average at best, their poison was even more potent than that of the Tarantula King. Yang Ling was lucky that he did not face any danger under the protection of the Horned Bee Beasts. Over several days, he hadn’t found any traces of high level Evil Eyes, but instead, he had managed to hunt the Essence Crystals of a dozen the centipedes.</p> <p>According to the memories of the Evil Eyes, these centipedes were also low level Magical Beasts, and they subsisted by consuming poisonous green algae that grew in dark corners. The older a centipede was, the more potent the poison within its body was. Those who were stung with its poison would see pustules grow all over their bodies, with the most serious cases resulting in rotting flesh and death.</p> <p>Not wanting to miss out, Yang Ling would slice open the head of the centipede-like insect every time he killed one and retrieve its dark green Essence Crystal. He might not have a use for them now, but they might prove useful in the future.</p> <p>At the start, he had wanted to tame a few of these creatures. But after seeing their slow speed, he gave up that thought after some consideration. The abilities of the troops were more important than their quantity. Good mobility was of utmost importance. Taming too many slow, low level Magical Beasts would severely inhibit the mobility of the entire army. The gains did not outweigh the losses!</p> <p>This day, while tailing a group of Evil Eyes foraging for food, Yang Ling silently arrived at a massive cave.</p> <p>This cave was different from the other caves of the Evil Eyes. A line of Evil Eyes were guarding this cave. In fact, there seemed to be a few hidden scouts. Also, a continuous stream of Evil Eyes were entering and leaving the cave.</p> <p>Could this be a supersized Evil Eye cave?</p> <p>Looking at the crowd of Evil Eyes going in and out of the cave, Yang Ling had a thought. He summoned a level three Horned Bee Beast.</p> <p>There were several dark green vines growing all around the cave of the Evil Eyes, their leaves lush. Using the leaves as cover, the fist-sized Horned Bee Beast silently infiltrated the cave. Indeed, there was something hidden within the cave. There were countless Evil Eyes within the cave, not only were there a large horde of level two Evil Eyes, there were even some who had evolved to level three.</p> <p>Yang Ling was very excited about the rare encounter with such a large scale Evil Eye nest, but he couldn’t help but frown when he looked at the Evil Eyes heavily guarding the cave. The hidden scouts were not a problem, as he could silently dispose of them by mobilizing a group of Horned Bee Beasts. But there was a continuous stream of Evil Eyes entering and exiting the cave. How could he get rid of those Evil Eyes at the door without causing any alarm?</p> <p>Should he instruct the Horned Bee Beasts to launch a surprise attack using their poisonous stingers? Or command the Tarantula King to lead the spider army in an all out attack?</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling shook his head. It would be easy to deal with the Evil Eyes guarding the entrance. The problem lay in the fact that there were too many Evil Eyes making their way in and out of the cave. If he could not deal with them all in an instant, a hard battle might ensue after the large group of Evil Eyes in the cave were prepared for battle.</p> <p>Evil Eyes that had not evolved were slow moving, their intellect and offensive capabilities severely lacking. But Evil Eyes that have evolved to level two and three were different. They possessed a certain amount of intelligence and movement speed. Even though their defensive capabilities had no obvious change, their offensive capabilities were enhanced by several multiples.</p> <p>In addition, if there was an Evil Eye King like the Tarantula King within this cave, then the attacks of the large group of high level Evil Eyes would become even more terrifying. Yang Ling was unwilling to engage in an all out battle with the Evil Eyes unless he had absolutely no choice. He did not wish to lose eight hundred of his troops to kill a thousand of the enemy’s. No matter the occasion, obtaining the largest amount of benefits with the lowest cost was the smartest thing to do.</p> <p>An armed infiltration behind enemy lines?</p> <p>Yang Ling came up with a brilliant idea as he looked at the countless wild Evil Eyes and thought about his own Evil Eye army. Clenching his teeth, he decided to take the gamble. He would instruct his army to attack if he failed.</p> <p>After instructing a team of Horned Bee Beasts to quickly get rid of the other party’s hidden scouts, Yang Ling quietly summoned his Magical Beast army.</p> <p>The two thousand Evil Eyes were split into ten waves, their primary responsibilities to mix into the cave. They were to quickly deal with the other party’s elites when they received the order to attack, then block the critical tunnels or places with high vantage points.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts were split into five groups and put in charge of long-distance ambushes. When the Evil Eyes were in position, the Horned Bee Beasts were to immediately deal with the guards at the entrance, then quickly charge into the cave to reinforce the Evil Eyes that had poor defensive capabilities.</p> <p>The spider army under the Tarantula King was split into ten teams. Eight of the teams were to closely follow the actions of the Horned Bee Beasts. Their missions were to dispatch the wild Evil Eyes at the front of the cave as fast as possible. The other two teams were responsible for acting together with the Withered Tree Warriors to stop the Evil Eyes that were outside foraging for food from returning as reinforcements.</p> <p>After the preparations had been made, Yang Ling got onto the Unicorn without hesitation and instructed the Evil Eyes to act immediately.</p> <p>Perhaps it was because there were too many Evil Eyes coming and going, but neither the traveling Evil Eyes or the Evil Eyes guarding the entrance noticed a few groups of foreign Evil Eyes infiltrating the cave. If they had observed a little closer, they would have realized that these foreign Evil Eyes had three tentacles on either side of their bodies and were rare level threes.</p> <p>Unfortunately for them, none of the guards noticed this unusual situation. Just like that, Yang Ling’s plan was already half successful. The careless wild Evil Eyes did not know that an unprecedented disaster was about to befall them!</p> <p>With the improvement in his Wizard Power, Yang Ling could now control the movement of each of his Magical Beasts within a five-mile radius. Even though he would exhaust more Wizard Power if he had to control them for a long time or use them to do precise tasks, he could still control the Magical Beasts enough to deal with the battle before him. Under his command, the Evil Eyes that infiltrated the cave all took up advantageous positions in the terrain.</p> <p>After confirming that the Evil Eyes were in position, Yang Ling decisively ordered the rest of the Magical Beasts to act. In that instant, the prepared Horned Bee Beasts pounced outward like supersonic fighter jets, charging straight for the wild Evil Eyes at the entrance of the cave.</p> <p>After releasing a concentrated wave of poisonous stingers, the Horned Bee Beast army flew into the cave without stopping. Under their lightning-fast ambush and the cloud of poisonous stingers, none the Evil Eyes that were caught off guard survived.</p> <p>Even though it could not keep up with the speedy Horned Bee Beasts, the Tarantula King also commanded its army to move. Under its orders, the spiders that were in formation swarmed toward the Evil Eyes’ cave. The defenseless Evil Eyes had no chance to retaliate.</p> <p>After instructing the remaining two teams of tarantulas and the Withered Tree Warriors to get into position to kill off any enemy reinforcements, Yang Ling rode his Unicorn and quickly caught up to the ferocious spider army. Surrounded by these spider troops that did not fear death, the Unicorn didn’t even get the chance to attack anything.</p> <p>Within the cave, the Magical Beast army was unstoppable. A few high level wild Evil Eyes had just gathered a bunch of low level Evil Eyes to retaliate when they were immediately struck down by the Horned Bee Beasts. Without a leader, the unintelligent low level Evil Eyes all staggered around as they tried to escape, unable to play to their numbers advantage.</p> <p>Facing the Magical Beast army’s attacks from the inside and the outside, facing their fierce combined attacks from the sky and the ground, the defenseless wild Evil Eyes were completely defeated. Furthermore, the Evil Eyes that were returning as reinforcements were also subjected to fierce attacks. They were like moths fluttering into a blazing torch.</p> <p>The outcome was clear. Yang Ling took control of the situation not long after! The ground inside the cave and around the cave’s mouth was littered with the corpses of wild Evil Eyes. Blood accumulated on the ground in the middle of the cave, forming a pool of blood. There was a thick metallic stench in the air.</p> <p>According to a preliminary count, nearly five thousand Evil Eyes had been eradicated in this battle. Amongst them, there were more than two hundred that had evolved to the third level and more than eight hundred who were at the second level. Regrettably, there were no level four Evil Eyes, nor was there a champion like the Tarantula King.</p> <p>It looked like there was only one plan left!</p> <p>Since there was no true champion even in such a large Evil Eye tribe, Yang Ling no longer harbored much hope in this land basin. It looked like he would have to do this himself if he wanted to quickly obtain an Evil Eye King like the Tarantula King.</p> <p>Without hesitation, he instructed the Magical Beast army to guard the entrance while he set up a simple Spirit Gathering Spell Formation within the cave. He wanted to use his Wizard Power and life force to forcefully nurture an Evil Eye King.</p> <p>The situation in Wissen Town was delicate. He did not know exactly how things were going in town, having been in the Terras Forest for so long. He had to return as soon as possible, no matter the outcome of this experiment. After all, he could return here some other time if the experiment was not successful. But it would restrict Yang Ling’s future developments if Steve, the leader who had appeared out of nowhere, successfully gained a foothold.</p> <p>Choosing the most powerful Evil Eye, Yang Ling sat on the ground cross-legged and placed his right hand on its head. There were piles of Evil Eye Essence Crystals of varying sizes around him. He was going to go all out. He had decided to take a gamble. He ordered the Evil Eye in front of him to consume the Essence Crystals while he continuously injected it with his blood red Wizard Power and green life force, gradually increasing the intensity.</p> <p>Under the combined effects of the Essence Crystals, Wizard Power, and life force, the Evil Eye sprawled before Yang Ling gently started to shudder, its muscles and tentacles expanding, contracting, then expanding again, forming a continuous cycle…</p> <p>At the same time, under the effects of the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation, the spiritual energy within the land basin coursed into the cave. Even though it was incomparable to other places within Terras Forest, it was still an extravagant sight. If one observed closely, they would even see bolts of blood red vapor being released from the nearby Evil Eye corpses and drifting into a pool that rapidly entered the head of the Evil Eye that Yang Ling was developing.</p>",
  "Chapter 83: Evil Eye Tyrant": "<p>The Evil Eye would subconsciously let out a roar every time it consumed an Essence Crystal. It quickly absorbed the energy of the Essence Crystals with the help of the Wizard Power and life force.</p> <p>Slowly, its Essence Crystal expanded bit by bit and started to release bolts of red light. The mysterious pituitary gland also grew as it released waves of messy, yet increasingly powerful, ripples.</p> <p>I might as well go all out now!</p> <p>Seeing the transformation of the Evil Eye becoming more and more obvious, Yang Ling clenched his jaw, once again increasing the intensity of the energy he was injecting. The Evil Eye trembled, its six tentacles convulsing as it let out a suppressed howl. But at the same time, the rate of growth of its Essence Crystal and pituitary gland increased.</p> <p>As the thick metallic stench of blood within the cave spread further away, faint weird sounds from far away began to draw nearer, as if some monster was rapidly approaching.</p> <p>Hearing the strange sounds outside the cave becoming clearer, looking at the suppressed howls of the Evil Eye before Yang Ling, the rest of the Evil Eyes floated around in unease, as if their instincts were telling them of danger. Soon, the concentrated three-row formation turned into a complete mess.</p> <p>Unlike the flustered Evil Eyes, the spider army held their positions under the instructions of the Tarantula King. Seeing the mess of the Evil Eyes’ formation, the spiders quickly crawled forward to fill in the gaps, in case any Magical Beasts suddenly charged in. As a precaution, the Tarantula King even sent a team of elite troops to dig into the area around Yang Ling and act as his makeshift personal guards.</p> <p>Even though they did not have a champion like the Tarantula King to lead them, the Horned Bee Beasts were still roughly in their basic formation, continuing to execute Yang Ling’s instruction for them to act as scouts. The Withered Tree Warriors had a preliminary spiritual intelligence, so they were blockading the entrance of the cave just like normal. Their sharp spikes and hardy tree armor still made them the strongest infantry units.</p> <p>The powerful Unicorn did not leave Yang Ling’s side. As a high level Magical Beast, it knew that its master was in a situation where he was most vulnerable to an attack even without Yang Ling’s commands.</p> <p>Under his intense focus, even though Yang Ling could hear waves of faint, strange sounds, he did not have the excess energy to command his Horned Bee Beasts to head out and learn about the situation. As time passed, he noticed a strange phenomenon.</p> <p>At the start, the Evil Eye was merely passively absorbing the Wizard Power and life force he was injecting into its body. But sometime later, as it consumed more and more Essence Crystals, it slowly began to actively absorb the energy in his body. Not only that, but the rate of absorption was increasing.</p> <p>A failed experiment?</p> <p>Feeling the Wizard Power and life force well out of his body, Yang Ling creased his brows, feeling that something was off. But there was no turning back now. He clenched his teeth and began to retrieve and consume Magical Beast Blood Orbs from within his space ring to replenish the lost Wizard Power as he allowed the Evil Eye before him to absorb the energy in his body.</p> <p>Yang Ling did not care too much about the green life force that was abundant in the forest. Given enough time, he would be able to rapidly replenish the energy no matter how much of it he exhausted. But he was unwilling to waste the Wizard Power that he had to obtain through tough training. After all, the level of his Wizard Power decided if he would be able to tame more Magical Beasts and if he could quickly advance to the level of Earth Wizard or not.</p> <p>After absorbing a large amount of Wizard Power and life force, the Evil Eye before Yang Ling began to change rapidly.</p> <p>Its six tentacles slowly became thicker and longer, from the size of an adult’s wrist to the thickness of a person’s thigh. It also grew a blood red tentacle from either side of its body which became thicker and longer, like two long red vines.</p> <p>The lone eye on its head became larger, slowly growing from the size of a cup to the size of a bowl. Its color turned from a pale green to blood red. Coupled with the twitching tentacles and the black and white pattern on its skin, the Evil Eye looked hideous and exceptionally ferocious.</p> <p>The change to the appearance of the Evil Eye was immense, but the changes within its body were even more obvious. Its fiery red Essence Crystal had expanded to the size of a nectarine and was radiating a hot red glow like a miniature sun. Its pituitary gland had also expanded to five times its original size, and now radiated ripples that were more intense and clear.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was feeling that something was off, waves of strange, ear-piercing roars suddenly came from outside the cave, as if the cave had been heavily surrounded by a bunch of Magical Beasts.</p> <p>An enemy attack?</p> <p>Yang Ling was alarmed when he heard the strange sounds outside the cave. He forcefully gathered a shred of concentration to instruct the flustered Evil Eyes to get into their formation again. He then ordered a team of Horned Bee Beasts to attack, while the rest of the Magical Beasts were to be fully alert.</p> <p>Yang Ling had fast reactions, but his enemy’s reactions were faster. The Horned Bee Beasts hadn’t begun their attacks when the other party started their offensive.</p> <p>With a roar, a group of flying black creatures charged into the cave, fast as lightning. They had wide foreheads and sharp beaks. Their sharp claws were half an inch long and powerful enough to leave deep scratches on the hardy tree armor of the Withered Tree Warriors with a mere strike. From far away, their half-meter long triangular wings were forceful and powerful. They were like monkeys that could fly.</p> <p>Using the Evil Eyes’ memories, Yang Ling quickly understood that these attacking creatures were mid-low level Magical Beasts called Gargoyles. They were incredibly fast and had precise attacks. They subsisted on the brain matter of the Evil Eyes and some of the wild fruits in the land basin.</p> <p>Yang Ling guessed that it was precisely because of these creatures hunting the Evil Eyes that there could not be a naturally evolved level four Evil Eye King in the land basin. Even the powerful Horned Bee Beasts were unable to fend their surprise attack, much less the low level wild Evil Eyes.</p> <p>After exhausting their poisonous stingers in the battle against the wild Evil Eyes, the Horned Bee Beasts were not a match for the rather speedy Gargoyles in a one on one situation. But with the help of the spiders’ poisonous attacks, they were able to hold off the Gargoyles that were charging in with their numbers advantage.</p> <p>Even though the Withered Tree Warriors had powerful attacks, their speed unfortunately did not allow them to catch up with the speedy Gargoyles. Their sharp spikes were basically useless. The Evil Eyes were unable to launch a large scale counterattack in consideration of accidentally hitting the Horned Bee Beasts with friendly fire.</p> <p>Fortunately, under the command of the Tarantula King, the spider army stubbornly defended the cave, and their concentrated poisons sprayed toward the low flying Gargoyles. They were able to hold off against the fierce attacks of the Gargoyles together with the Horned Bee Beasts.</p> <p>The cave was easy to defend, yet hard to attack. Even though the Gargoyles charging in were unafraid of death and had powerful attacks, they still suffered heavy casualties against the massive numbers of Horned Bee Beasts and the cooperative spider army. In just a short amount of time, the ground became littered with a thick layer of their corpses.</p> <p>Despite the heavy casualties, the Gargoyles continued unleashing waves of attacks in an attempt to break through the line of defense formed by the Horned Bee Beasts and the spider army. With more and more Gargoyles swarming into the land basin, the situation was becoming even more dire for Yang Ling.</p> <p>Several times, groups of courageous Gargoyles managed to charge all the way to Yang Ling. There was even one time when a Gargoyle almost managed to grab onto his skull. Fortunately, the Tarantula King had prepared for this. The spiders that laid in ambush attacked in unison, working with the Unicorn to kill the enemy.</p> <p>D*mn it, I’ll gamble once again!</p> <p>Seeing the situation becoming even more dire, Yang Ling clenched his teeth and decided to give it his best effort. He injected all the Wizard Power and life force he had into the Evil Eye before him. In that instant, the Evil Eye sprawled on the ground and struggled with all its strength, howling as if it was in incredible pain.</p> <p>While Yang Ling concentrated and gave his best effort, he did not realize that the dead Gargoyles were also releasing streaks of blood vapor that were entering the Evil Eye’s head under the effects of the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation.</p> <p>Slowly, with the injection of a large amount of energy, the Evil Eye before him quickly started to expand like a balloon, gulping in the Wizard Power and life force in his body like a bottomless pit.</p> <p>After consuming the last Magical Beast Blood Orb beside him, seeing that the Evil Eye in front of him was still devouring the energy in his body without stop, Yang Ling knew that his experiment had failed. It was now becoming a serious problem. If Yang Ling did not stop now, his body might wither like a piece of human jerky.</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was prepared to forcefully shake away the Evil Eye before him, something strange suddenly happened. The pagoda-shaped brand between his brows started to heat up and released a massive amount of life force. The life force formed a thick ball of green fog, engulfing the Evil Eye completely.</p> <p>Suppressed roars sometimes escaped the green fog, as if a fierce, dying beast was engaging in an intense struggle. But listening closer, it also sounded like a fierce tiger ready to strike. What was even more terrifying was that the green fog was continuously absorbing all of the energy in the surroundings, devouring the pool of blood formed by the corpses of the thousands of wild Evil Eyes around them.</p> <p>Slumping down against the wall of the cave, Yang Ling cautiously took out his sharp dagger and tried his best to recover the Wizard Power in his body as he looked at the strange green fog.</p> <p>Even though the Gargoyles were still launching steady waves of attacks like the tide, there was no possibility of them breaking through and charging in within a short amount of time. The combined defenses of the Horned Bee Beasts and the spider army were still too strong. And no one knew what kind of monster the Evil Eye within the green fog would become. There was a need to be cautious!</p> <p>After the creature absorbed a large amount of blood vapor, the green fog gradually became thinner. Slowly, the outline of the mutated Evil Eye became visible. Its eight thick tentacles were two meters long. Its head was large, and its lone, blood red eye occupied about a third of its face.</p> <p>Bloodthirsty, ferocious!</p> <p>Yang Ling took in a deep breath as he looked at the mutated Evil Eye. He could feel waves of pulsing Magical Energy radiating from this ugly Evil Eye.</p> <p>Just as he was hesitantly wondering if he should preemptively kill this mutated Evil Eye, the creature let out a thunderous roar just as the last streaks of green mist scattered. In that moment, all of the Evil Eyes in the cave floated over in fear before obediently sprawling before it.</p> <p>A success?</p> <p>Looking at the mutated Evil Eye, then looking at the Evil Eye army before it, Yang Ling was elated. He knew that he had won the wager and successfully nurtured an Evil Eye King just like the Tarantula King.</p> <p>“Evolving within the metallic stench of blood, reborn from a massacre, bloodthirsty, ferocious, violent! I shall call you the Evil Eye Tyrant in the future!”</p> <p>After the unwarranted shock, Yang Ling shook his head. When he had been trying to feed this ravenous creature, it would only have taken a little more for him to turn into a human husk. It looked like it was better for him to refrain from forcefully increasing the level of a Magical Beast. The gains would not outweigh the losses if he were to carelessly throw in a large portion of his cultivation level.</p> <p>After hearing Yang Ling’s words, the mutated Evil Eye gave an excited nod, as if it was satisfied by the name “Tyrant.” Like the Tarantula King, even though it was unable to speak, it now had some intelligence and could express itself through its body language.</p> <p>But combat was the true test for ability!</p> <p>Taking in a deep breath, Yang Ling ordered the Evil Eye Tyrant to lead the Evil Eye army in an attack. He was prepared to wipe out the attacking Gargoyles, and at the same time, he wanted to see what the Evil Eye Tyrant that he had spent this much effort on had to offer.</p>",
  "Chapter 84: Bag Array Formation": "<p>The cave of the Evil Eyes was narrow at the entrance but wide inside, roughly triangular in shape. Marvellously, there was a circular arc-shaped mud wall fifty steps away from the entrance, presumably a defensive mechanism for the wild Evil Eyes.</p> <p>The mud wall was sturdy and at the perfect height for the Evil Eyes to duck behind and avoid the long-range attacks of their enemies. Standing up, the Evil Eyes could then observe the situation before them. If there was a large number of Evil Eyes here, the enemies would not be able to charge into the cave no matter how powerful they were.</p> <p>Yang Ling praised his good luck after understanding the terrain within the cave. If not for his Evil Eye army quickly occupying the high vantage points and killing the high level wild Evil Eyes responsible for commanding the rest of the Evil Eyes, even he might not have had an easy time attacking this cave.</p> <p>After ordering the Evil Eye Tyrant to instruct its Evil Eye army to set up an ambush behind the mud wall, Yang Ling had a thought as he saw the triangular shaped area in the cave and the two hundred red-haired tarantulas protecting him. He recalled the famous “bag array formation” used in ambushes as well as a few historical anecdotes he had read about while he was bored in college.</p> <p>The bag array formation, as its name implied, required one to set up an ambush. After luring the enemy into the ambush, friendly forces would charge out from three other directions and launch a surprise attack on the enemies who were caught off guard, thus blocking all routes that the enemy could use to escape.</p> <p>There had been a prolific use of this strategy in China during the Revolutionary War.</p> <p>On July 2nd, 1935, the Twenty-fifth Red Army rushed to the Goukou Village in Shanyang County, then set up ambushes in the mountains around the area, completely annihilating the first wave of enemies that were chasing behind them. They achieved a great victory, injuring over 300 of the enemy forces and capturing more than 1400 people as prisoners. They also confiscated 40 heavy artillery units and more than 1600 rifles.</p> <p>While it was important that there was a successful ambush, it was also important that they had enough firepower. Otherwise, if the enemy launched their full offensive capabilities to break the formation, it would only backfire and result in a disastrous outcome!</p> <p>After the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, the American army started advancing toward the main island of Japan. Along the way, the two were tied in the battle for critical islands. In some areas, the battles even resembled tug-of-war’s.</p> <p>Many times, the American army would set up ambushes after gaining control of an island to deal with the attacking Japanese army. Unfortunately, because their firepower was too scattered, they were not only unable to severely damage the enemy, the anxious Japanese army broke apart the formation of the Americans, causing their strategy to turn against them.</p> <p>Absorbing the lessons taught in history, Yang Ling was prepared to assign a large number of troops in the middle of the mud wall and calmly command the actions of his Magical Beast army.</p> <p>He left the Horned Bee Beasts to fend off the Gargoyles, then recalled the Withered Tree Warriors before gradually pulling back the spider army led by the Tarantula King. He commanded the spiders to retreat while getting into an ambush formation along the walls of the caves. He wanted to wait for the large group of Gargoyles to take the bait before allowing the spiders to suddenly skitter out from underground to block their path of retreat.</p> <p>After a large portion of the spiders retreated, the Horned Bee Beasts also started falling back in batches under Yang Ling’s command. They pretended to be unable to fend off the enemy, luring a bunch of relentless Gargoyles into the area of the ambush little by little.</p> <p>After their heavy casualties, the Gargoyles swarmed in relentlessly when they saw their enemies suffering defeat. As level four Magical Beasts, which were in the mid to low range, their individual battle abilities were far superior to the level two Horned Bee Beasts and tarantulas. If not for the cave being easy to defend and hard to attack, if not for the combined defenses of the Horned Bee Beasts and spiders, the Gargoyles would have broken into the cave long ago.</p> <p>In their frenzy, the Gargoyles unleashed their bestial instincts, losing the caution and calm that they should have had. They were completely oblivious to the fact that they had just entered a land of death. Without the obstruction of the Horned Bee Beasts and spider army, they charged into the cave in the blink of an eye. A preliminary observation would place their numbers at around a thousand.</p> <p>Thirty steps, twenty-five steps, twenty steps…</p> <p>Looking at the horde of approaching Gargoyles, Yang Ling’s palms were covered in sweat. He decided to wait a moment longer after clenching his teeth. He could have held on longer before taking a stand, but now that he had committed, he had to defeat them all.</p> <p>The number of Gargoyles sieging him was massive, their attacks powerful. If he were to recall his Magical Beast army and run away on the high level Unicorn without battling, he might not be able to make it out of the cave. If he instructed the Magical Beast army to forcefully surround the Gargoyles, his Magical Beast army would suffer heavy casualties even if he was lucky enough to make it out. Since that was the case, he might as well take the gamble.</p> <p>A giant gamble, this is a truly giant gamble!</p> <p>He had placed all his hopes on the Evil Eye army led by the Evil Eye Tyrant for this battle. If the ambushing Evil Eyes could defeat the elites of the enemy, if the troops in the forefront could hold up against the enemy’s powerful attacks, the surrounding spider army and Horned Bee Beasts would be able to kill off a large portion of the Gargoyles with a surprise attack. This was the only way he could fully display the effectiveness of the bag array formation.</p> <p>Failure is not an option!</p> <p>Seeing the approaching Gargoyles, Yang Ling quickly placed his various Wizard Amulets before him. He was taking out all of his treasures for this battle. He had wanted to use the many Wizard Amulets he had created to deal with Steve’s Black Armor Guards. He hadn’t expected to find a use for them today.</p> <p>In a large scale battle, the effects of powerful Wizard Amulets like the Palm Lightning and Sky Blasting Cannon would definitely be decent. Yang Ling also believed that Wizard Amulets that launched attacks on the mental level like the Dolphin Sonar would also act as a surprising interference to the enemy forces.</p> <p>When the Gargoyles were just ten steps away from him, just as they accelerated once again and were preparing to attack, Yang Ling gave the order to attack.</p> <p>In that instant, under the command of the Evil Eye Tyrant, all of the prepared Evil Eyes floated. After launching a wave of blinding light, a concentrated rain of light bullets fell onto the Gargoyles charging forward, mercilessly finishing off the frontline of the enemy.</p> <p>Caught off guard, all of the Gargoyles charging forward fell for the trap, involuntarily closing their aching eyes and being hit by the focused rain of light bullets. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the creatures at the back decided to accelerate once again in an attempt to charge forward before the Evil Eyes could launch their third wave of attacks.</p> <p>Even though they had evolved to the third level, there was still a cooldown period between the attacks of the Evil Eyes. Even though the Withered Tree Warriors were covered with a hardy tree armor and had powerful attacks, they were too slow and could not block the speedy enemy forces. The Horned Bee Beasts and spider army were good in both offense and defense, but unfortunately, it was not time for them to strike. Some of the Gargoyles were still outside the bag array formation.</p> <p>The situation was dire. The outcome would be disastrous if Yang Ling could not stop this attack!</p> <p>At the critical moment, Yang Ling and the Unicorn struck.</p> <p>Yang Ling threw out powerful Wizard Amulets like the Palm Lightning and Sky Lightning Cannon as if they were free, causing waves of explosions. They crashed into the charging Gargoyles as though they were grenades.</p> <p>The Palm Lightning caused the Gargoyles suffering, but the Dolphin Sonar displayed some unexpected effects. After a sharp soundwave, the attacking Gargoyles all let out pathetic wails. It was as if their brains had been hit fiercely by a large steel hammer. Some of them stopped in their tracks, some crashed into their surroundings, some even fell to the ground.</p> <p>Yang Ling’s attacks were powerful, but they were nothing compared to the Unicorn’s. After a roar, the level eight Magical Beast instantly released thick bolts of snake-shaped lightning, forming a physical, charged net of electricity in the blink of an eye. All the Gargoyles within the net of electricity got burned to crisps by the electricity and fell to the ground like rain.</p> <p>One man and one beast. The instant explosive firepower caught the enemies off guard, forcefully fending off the first wave of their attacks.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>After suffering from the powerful attacks of Yang Ling and the Unicorn, the Gargoyles who were attacking to the front changed their direction, preparing to attack to the right where the defense was weak. If they were to engage in direct battle, the slow Evil Eyes with weak defensive capabilities would definitely suffer heavy casualties.</p> <p>Fast, the Gargoyles were too fast!</p> <p>The enemy changed their direction suddenly and shifted their focus to attacking the right flank. Even the Unicorn would be unable to reinforce them in time, much less Yang Ling. The outcome would be disastrous if the Evil Eyes’ line of defense was to be broken.</p> <p>At the critical moment, the Evil Eye Tyrant stepped forward and launched a continuous barrage of light bullets after letting out a roar. Shockingly, the light bullets it shot out would split from one to two, then two to four, four to eight… They divided continuously as they rained down on the speedy Gargoyles.</p> <p>Napalm bombs?</p> <p>Yang Ling was pleasantly surprised when he saw the Evil Eye Tyrant’s powerful ability. His efforts had finally paid off. If this Evil Eye Tyrant was not able to unleash anything powerful, then it would not have been worth it to spend such a large amount of Essence Crystals, Wizard Power, and life force on developing him.</p> <p>The light missiles that had been split apart were not only immensely powerful, they also had paralyzing effects. When hit, the Gargoyles would even have trouble breathing, and they fell helplessly onto the ground, unable to attack.</p> <p>Reacting to the situation, the Gargoyles began to change course continuously, trying to escape the light bullets of the Evil Eye Tyrant using their impeccable flying techniques and high speed. But another surprise happened.</p> <p>After a violent roar, bolts of red light shot out from the Evil Eye Tyrant’s lone eye. Within the radius of the red light, the napalm bombs began to change their trajectory automatically, pursuing the dodging Gargoyles with blinding speed.</p> <p>Seriously? Guided missiles?</p> <p>Yang Ling was shocked once again. He had not expected the Evil Eye Tyrant to possess such a terrifying ability. It looked like the Evil Eye Tyrant had undergone an unimaginable transformation after consuming such a large amount of Essence Crystals, Wizard Power, and life force. Barring anything else, it was at least more powerful than the level four Tarantula King.</p> <p>After repelling the attack of the Gargoyles, the Evil Eye Tyrant became pale. The rate at which it fired out its light bullets became slower, and even its body that was suspended in the air seemed like it was about to fall. Despite the creature’s power, it looked like the napalm bombs and automatic tracking ability had exhausted a large amount of Magical Energy and mental strength.</p> <p>Even though the Evil Eye Tyrant had only launched one wave of attacks, it was more than enough to buy the Evil Eyes precious time. The Gargoyles once again suffered a heavy setback following the attacks of the Evil Eye army.</p> <p>Moths to a flame, seeking their own deaths!</p> <p>Seeing that the time was almost right, Yang Ling ordered the Horned Bee Beasts and spider army who were waiting in ambush to come out, blocking the enemy’s path of retreat. Under the combined attacks of the Magical Beast army on land and in the air, under their heavy encirclement, it was basically over for the Gargoyles that had charged into the ambush.</p>",
  "Chapter 85: The Sealed Underground City": "<p>With the success of the bag array formation in defending against the attacks of the enemy and blockading their route of escape, victory was only a matter of time.</p> <p>Under the combined attacks of the Magical Beast army, the sieging Gargoyles were defeated one after the other. Some of them were hit by the Evil Eyes’ light bullets that carried paralyzing properties, some were hit by the poison of the spiders, and some were torn to shreds by the Horned Bee Beasts. There were even some that were burned black by the Unicorn. Of course, credit also had to be given to Yang Ling’s Wizard Amulets.</p> <p>The great battle soon came to an end. The ground and walls of the cave were all splattered with fresh blood. The fifty steps from the entrance of the cave to the mud wall were littered with the corpses of the Gargoyles.</p> <p>After instructing a group of Horned Bee Beasts to patrol the outside of the cave as a precaution, Yang Ling quickly cleaned up the scene. He sliced open the heads of the Gargoyles with his sharp dagger and retrieved their mud gray Essence Crystals. He tamed the Gargoyles who still had all their limbs intact and could still be used with a drop of his blood.</p> <p>Compared to the Essence Crystals of level one or two Magical Beasts, the Essence Crystals of the Gargoyles were considerably larger. Even though they were incomparable to the Essence Crystals of mid-high level Magical Beasts such as the Lightning Birds, they still harbored a great amount of energy and could be used to set up a few simple Maze Formations or Spirit Gathering Spell Formations.</p> <p>There were many dead Gargoyles, but there were many who were heavily injured and still convulsing! After an hour, Yang Ling had tamed a full two hundred of the creatures that could still be used with the last of his Wizard Power. Even though they were all heavily injured, Yang Ling believed that they would be able to recover fully after staying in the Wizard’s Pagoda for a few days. Then, he would have another exceptional Magical Beast army.</p> <p>Lightning fast speed, powerful attacks, weak defense!</p> <p>Even though he had luckily managed to defeat the attacking Gargoyles in one fell swoop, he had gotten a deeper understanding of the battle capabilities of the level four Magical Beasts.</p> <p>To some extent, the Gargoyles were similar to the Horned Bee Beasts, their offensive capabilities far exceeding their defense. They might be able to obtain a swift victory against weaker enemies. But they might not be effective if they encountered a calm, defensive enemy with respectable offensive capabilities. They might even suffer a complete defeat.</p> <p>But even though they were similar, there were still some differences between the Gargoyles and Horned Bee Beasts. Their hard, sharp claws, coupled with their long wingspans and impressive physical power made their direct offensive capabilities stand out. But their abilities when it came to ambushing enemies paled in comparison to the fist-sized Horned Bee Beasts.</p> <p>Their slender bodies, incredible speed, and poisonous stingers that were hard to guard against all made the Horned Bee Beasts Yang Ling’s most powerful assassins. The Horned Bee Beasts were definitely no match for the Gargoyles in a one on one fight to the death. But if they were to cross paths suddenly, a large group of Gargoyles might not be able to defeat the same number of Horned Bee Beasts that still had their poisonous stingers at full power.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, the differences between high level Magical Beasts and low level Magical Beasts were obvious. When faced with high level Magical Beasts, the only choice low level Magical Beasts had was to run. But sometimes, their levels were not enough to explain the entire situation!</p> <p>As long as they fully utilized their surroundings, it was possible for low level Magical Beasts to defeat high level Magical Beasts. The great success of the bag array formation explained everything. If he had been suddenly attacked by a large group of Gargoyles in the vast outdoors, Yang Ling’s best hope would’ve been to run.</p> <p>After cleaning up the scene, Yang Ling got on his Unicorn and recalled the Magical Beast army. He then charged out the cave like the wind, retreating as he rummaged through the memories of the Gargoyles.</p> <p>There were many impossibly deep caves in the land basin. None of the Gargoyles knew how many monsters hid within them, and thus he had to leave the bloody cave as fast as possible. If the thick metallic stench of blood attracted another group of high level Magical Beasts, the outcome would be disastrous.</p> <p>According to the memories of the tamed Gargoyles, the Gargoyles had come from a cave five miles away. That was the location of the Gargoyle tribe closest to the Evil Eyes’ cave. Other than occasionally coming out to hunt high level Evil Eyes, the gargoyles rarely appeared in the land basin. Long ago, they had been given a mission to defend an ancient city that had been sealed underground.</p> <p>A sealed underground city?</p> <p>An underground city guarded by a group of dark element monsters?</p> <p>Yang Ling was surprised. He instructed the Unicorn to stop at a desolate hill and began seriously searching through the Gargoyles’ memories.</p> <p>The Gargoyles’ memories of the underground city itself were sketchy, but they contained some relevant information about the Magical Beasts guarding the underground city. According to their memories, the place was also guarded by groups of mid level Magical Beasts such as Demon Harpies, Medusas, and Minotaurs. In fact, it was rumored that there were high level Magical Beasts such as Chimeras and Dark Dragons guarding the deepest depths of the area.</p> <p>An underground city guarded by a large number of high level Magical Beasts. Could this be the rumored relic of the giant dragon, in which the many Undead Divine Weapons were sealed?</p> <p>Yang Ling had a thought. He recalled the information that was secretly making its way around Wissen Town. At the very beginning, there were rumors that someone had spotted a cave of an ancient giant dragon deep within Terras Forest, and that it had several rare treasures within it. The information had attracted a large number of troops and adventurers into the dilapidated Wissen Town.</p> <p>In recent times, through the information he had gotten from the thief Fenlist, Yang Ling found out that someone had spotted the relic of the Holy Dragon Ayrpaciro which sealed the Undead Divine Weapons, and that it was not as simple as a mere cave of an ancient giant dragon. In recent times, many mysterious figures had successively infiltrated Wissen Town, proving that there was some truth to the reports.</p> <p>According to the reports from his intelligence organization Parrot, these mysterious figures were different from the average adventurer. They would either shut themselves within Shangri-La and be busy the entire day, or they would journey in the wilderness, entering and coming out of the Terras Forest all day long.</p> <p>The average adventurer would be very concerned about the situation in Wissen Town, occasionally cursing the leader Steve, some even picking off lone Black Armor Guards. But these mysterious figures were different. They were unconcerned about the situation in Wissen Town, not caring about the battle between the Banto and Rossi forces.</p> <p>After suddenly obtaining information about the underground city, Yang Ling deliberated for a moment before deciding to silently infiltrate and learn more about the situation. Even though he was unsure of how powerful the so-called Undead Divine Weapons were, he was sure that they were treasures that were hard to come by, since there were so many Magical Beasts guarding them, people were coming from all over the land to fight for them.</p> <p>After making a decision, he recalled the Unicorn without hesitation and summoned a group of Horned Bee Beasts to protect himself. Even though the Unicorn was powerful, the ripples of Magical Energy it radiated were too strong and would easily attract the attention of the Magical Beasts. He was merely doing a preliminary scouting run this time around. He was not interested in doing battle with a large group of high level Magical Beasts.</p> <p>Yang Ling headed east, and soon after, he arrived at the Gargoyle’s cave after leaping over some short shrub.</p> <p>The cave was large and had weirdly shaped rocks littered everywhere, as if it were a natural granite cave. The deeper he went into the cave, the more forks in the path appeared. Without the memories of the Gargoyles, he might have lost his way in just a few minutes.</p> <p>Perhaps it was due to the annihilation of their tribe, but Yang Ling did not encounter any Gargoyles at the start. But he slowly started noticing a few patrolling Gargoyles the deeper into the cave he got. He would sometimes also encounter hidden scouts sitting by the wall of the cave-like statues. Fortunately, the Horned Bee Beasts had sharp senses; otherwise, he would have exposed himself on multiple occasions. According to the memories of the tamed Gargoyles, he had already arrived in the area of influence of another group of Gargoyles.</p> <p>Hidden scouts. How interesting!</p> <p>Yang Ling had a thought after witnessing the abilities of the Gargoyles. He would definitely catch his enemies off guard if he were to plant hidden scouts like this within Wissen Castle. After all, not everyone had senses as sharp as the Horned Bee Beasts, and not everyone was as nimble as he was.</p> <p>In order to get as close as possible to the underground city, Yang Ling was incredibly cautious as he moved. He made use of the rubble that littered the ground to hide his tracks, narrowly avoiding the patrolling Gargoyles time and time again.</p> <p>After making his way past the area of influence of the Gargoyles, monsters that had human heads and eagle-like bodies started to appear, floating in the air like Eber Eagles. Their sharp claws gleamed with cold light. It was obvious that they were incredibly sharp.</p> <p>According to the memories of the Gargoyles, the monsters before him were level four Magical Beasts called Demon Harpies. Even though they were Magical Beasts of the same level, their defensive capabilities were much stronger than the Gargoyles. They were not only speedy, they also naturally learned acceleration spells that were of a wind element. If need be, they could use their Magical Energy to launch arrow-like attacks, then retreat before the enemy troops could react.</p> <p>And the senses of the Demon Harpies were even sharper than those of the Gargoyles. Yang Ling had just stepped into their area of influence when a team of alert creatures charged over to conduct a thorough check. Luckily, there was a small cave in a wall nearby. Yang Ling managed to narrowly avoid them by hiding in the cave.</p> <p>Must I give up halfway?</p> <p>Seeing the Demon Harpies circling in the area near him, Yang Ling could not think of a way to secretly infiltrate the area no matter how hard he tried. Killing the patrolling creatures with his massive Magical Beast army was not a problem, but the outcome would be disastrous if he alerted the other guards and attracted a large group of high level Magical Beasts.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling decided to retreat. According to the memories of the Gargoyles, he would encounter level five Minotaurs and Medusas after making it past the Demon Harpies’ area of influence. If the Demon Harpies were already this hard to deal with, the Minotaurs and Medusas who were a full level higher would be even more so, much less the high level Chimeras and Dark Dragons. Even if he was lucky enough to infiltrate the city, whether he could escape alive was another matter.</p> <p>There will never be a shortage of firewood as long as the green hills remain!</p> <p>There were not many humans that would come to Valenia Valley. The possibility of an average person finding this cave and successfully infiltrating the underground city was even more minuscule. Even if he didn’t have the ability to scout the underground city now, that didn’t mean he’d be unable to do so in the future.</p> <p>Yang Ling believed that there would be a day where he could return to Valenia Valley once he advanced to the level of Earth Wizard, cultivated the Wizard Core, and tamed more high level Magical Beasts. Perhaps he might be able to find a way back to Earth after obtaining the so-called Undead Divine Weapons. Of course, it would be even better if he could find a way to traverse between this world and Earth freely.</p> <p>With the guidance of the Horned Bee Beasts, relying on the low light and his agile movements, Yang Ling managed to avoid the patrolling Demon Harpies and Gargoyles as he carefully exited the massive cave.</p>",
  "Chapter 86: Beautiful Woman Tugging on Souls": "<p>Traveling on the speedy Unicorn, Yang Ling returned to Wissen Castle in just four hours. The first thing Yang Ling did when he got back was to ask his tactician Goode about the latest developments in Wissen Town.</p> <p>“Sir, the situation is becoming more and more complicated, and harder and harder to control!” Goode, who was wearing his usual black robe, had a worried expression. He sat down on the other side of Yang Ling when Yang Ling instructed him to.</p> <p>More and more complicated?</p> <p>Even though he was prepared for this, Yang Ling still creased his brows when he heard Goode say this. Goode then continued to explain.</p> <p>It turned out that Steve’s tactician had suggested a new tactic just after Yang Ling went into the Terras Forest to train. Steve had consolidated his forces and set up barriers on every path toward Wissen Town to carefully examine townspeople who were making their way to and fro. This way, he could severely limit the mobility and the information gathering abilities of the Rossi forces.</p> <p>In addition, Steve had forcefully taken the food stores of the townspeople. He had also purchased hides that the townspeople had treated at extremely low prices in order to collect a large amount of resources. Even though that would not allow him to make it through the long harsh winter, it could at least sustain him for the time being, until reinforcements and supplies could be sent from his home empire.</p> <p>Faced with Steve’s extortion, the townspeople formed groups to retaliate, but they were unable to stand up to the Banto Empire’s elite Black Armor Guards without a leader. Even though a few troops and adventurers secretly joined the strikes, they were unable to alleviate the situation. They were all suppressed forcefully by Steve’s Black Armor Guards.</p> <p>In order to threaten the enraged townspeople, the Black Armor Guards mercilessly hung the warriors who took part in the strikes on the trees by the roadside. They would whip the corpses for three days before dragging them into Terras Forest and intentionally luring in large groups of wild beasts to devour the bodies.</p> <p>Perhaps their hatred was not alleviated even after killing the people, or perhaps they wanted to seize the opportunity to extort the townspeople even further. Either way, the Black Armor Guards under Steve even broke into people’s homes, robbed them, and burned their possessions in the name of searching for protesting citizens and Rossi soldiers. They committed all manners of evil, breaking apart many families. In the eyes of the people, Steve was not a leader, he was a demon that came from Hell.</p> <p>In the short span of a few days, the situation in Wissen Town had become a complete mess. In order to avoid the conflicts, many people dragged their families to seek refuge at Wissen Castle. Even though Steve was powerful, he did not dare to have a direct falling out with Yang Ling, given his mysterious background and the fierce guards under him.</p> <p>The townspeople were being bullied, and the troops and merchants had lost their sources of income. For the time being, even though Steve seemed to have gained control of the situation on the surface, the situation was becoming more and more dangerous. Small skirmishes with the Black Armor Guards happened frequently.</p> <p>At the same time, due to the rumors of an ancient dragon’s cave being discovered in Terras Forest, there were more and more troops and adventurers swarming into Wissen Town, making the situation even more complicated.</p> <p>Steve is forcing the townspeople to rebel?</p> <p>When he understood the current situation, Yang Ling took a sip of the refreshing jasmine tea without changing his expression. There were both good and bad things about the current situation. Steve consolidating his forces and increasing the intensity of his inspections meant that the difficulty of launching surprise attacks had increased drastically. Steve could last for a while longer now, having stolen some rations and hides to ward off the cold.</p> <p>But igniting the fury of the people was not beneficial to his rule. That rage would become a sharp sword if Yang Ling utilized it correctly.</p> <p>“Goode, what is the current situation with the Rossi forces?”</p> <p>“Sir, they aren’t doing well. They have already sent repeated requests for us to supply them with resources such as rations, clothes, and weapons. They still accepted these supplies hungrily even though I doubled the price!” Goode hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Furthermore, they have requested that we supply them with even more accurate information!”</p> <p>Steve had consolidated his forces and strengthened the intensity of his patrols, while Yang Ling at the same time had taken away the Horned Bee Beasts and Withered Tree Warriors who were previously providing information. At that point, it had been hard for Goode to obtain detailed information about the activity of the Black Armor Guards. It was even harder for the Rossi forces. The efficiency of each of their surprise attacks was declining. With the temperature getting colder, they became as nervous as ants on a heated pot.</p> <p>“Goode, from today onward, double the price of the resources and intelligence sold to the Rossi forces once again!”</p> <p>Yang Ling leaned back comfortably on the large chair. The Rossi troops must be incredibly anxious in such a situation. They might agree to purchase all of the resources available if Yang Ling tripled the price, much less doubled it. After all, compared to breaking the battle strategy of the Banto Empire, their mortal enemy, mere tens of thousands of Purple Crystal Coins was nothing to them. He would be letting himself down if he did not extort them at a time like this.</p> <p>“Sir, I just doubled the price a few days ago. If I double it again now, will they…” Goode was a little hesitant, worried that the Rossi forces would not accept the offer.</p> <p>“Haha, relax. The Rossi troops have no other choice at this point!” Yang Ling let out a calm smile and said, “Chasing after profit is the instinct of a businessman. It would not be normal for us to be supplying them with various resources at a low price at this point.”</p> <p>Chasing after profit is the instinct of a businessman?</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Goode understood; the Rossi forces might actually become more suspicious and difficult to deal with if Yang Ling didn’t gouge them.</p> <p>“Goode, select a few suitable people over the next few days and set up a team that specializes in assassination and surprise attacks.” Looking at the confused Goode, Yang Ling continued, “The personalities of the candidates should be calm and composed. They have to be as merciless as a venomous snake, agile as a Cloud Leopard, and able to kill with a single strike. As for the name of this group, let’s call it Sudden Strike!”</p> <p>A team responsible for assassination? After a moment’s surprise, Goode was a little hesitant. “Sir, what you mean is…”</p> <p>“Haha, times are coming when we will have to help the Rossi forces. The enemy of our enemy is our friend! Steve is unrepentant and arrogant; it’s about time to teach him a lesson!”</p> <p>After giving a few more instructions, Yang Ling left with large strides. When he returned to the yard, he thought about getting Alice to send him some snacks, but he suddenly recalled that he hadn’t had one of John’s famous mixed drinks for many days now. Thinking about it, he could practically smell the fragrant wine. Thus, he decided to walk toward Shangri-La. Behind him, Argus followed closely with a group of guards.</p> <p>Argus had been training hard while Yang Ling was gone. With Casey and Goode’s help, he had finally advanced to become a beginner level Great Swordsman. Even though he was still not an expert, he had definitely crossed a hurdle. He could at least threaten and successfully command the barbarians under him.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Football should be watched with large groups of people, and the same went for drinking!</p> <p>Unlike the dwarf Rumi, who viewed alcohol as his life, Yang Ling did not enjoy drinking alone. When he had just graduated, he would frequently go bar hopping with a few of his classmates or colleagues. To him, savoring an ice-cold beer while teasing a lonely lady or innocent teen girl at the bar was the greatest enjoyment he could get after work.</p> <p>He could not watch the European Cup as there were no televisions in Wissen Town, nor were there games like World of Warcraft. But a bar here was more or less the same as a bar on Earth. There were the same greedy alcoholics, the same boorish curses, and of course, there were many slender and supple beauties…</p> <p>Sometimes, Yang Ling would have an illusion while he leaned on the tall chair in the Shangri-La bar with an ice-cold rum in his hands as he looked at a couple doing the hanky-panky in a dark corner. In that instant, it was as if he had returned to the bar beside his school. Some times, he would even, for a second, wonder if he was dreaming a beautiful, adventurous dream all this while.</p> <p>As per usual, Yang Ling freely greeted a few familiar looking troops. He then sat on a tall chair by the bar and asked the genius bartender John to serve him a premium cocktail.</p> <p>“Boss, which wind blew you here today?” John smiled as he passed Yang Ling a cocktail that looked like a dry glass of red wine.</p> <p>“Haha, I didn’t get the east wind, but I have been eating the northwestern wind for the entire night. Quick, hand me two plates of peanuts, I am famished!” Yang Ling patted John’s shoulder.</p> <p>Taking a sip of the delicious wine and chewing on two Alpen Peanuts, Yang Ling licked his lips in joy. But just as he was about to get John to hand him another glass of alcohol, the rowdy bar suddenly turned silent. Following which, footsteps could be heard, clear and slow. At the same time, a faint fragrance wafted in from outside.</p> <p>Looking up, all Yang Ling saw was a beauty in black walking into the bar. Her fair, delicate skin, slender waist, as well as her supple, perky breasts… The troops around him swallowed, all of them unable to come to their senses for the longest time, as if the beauty in black had stolen their souls when she appeared.</p> <p>It was all a matter of perspective!</p> <p>Looking at the beauty in black’s large, perky breasts, Yang Ling finally knew what voluptuous meant. Looking at her beautiful face and body, he finally understood what an angel-like face and devilish figure truly meant.</p> <p>If Alice was a young green apple, and Sofia was a blossoming flower, then the beauty in black before him would be a fully ripe peach, filled with fatal temptation.</p> <p>After walking slowly into Shangri-La, Maryse’s glistening gaze scanned past the troops and finally landed on Yang Ling. She believed that with her charms, she would be able to make Yang Ling fall head over heels in love with her. She was certain she could convince him to obediently hand over the Snake Demon Blood Staff, as well as join the dark side just by using a few tricks.</p>",
  "Chapter 87: Rose with Thorns": "<p>Yang Ling was caught in a daze, but he suddenly felt the pagoda-shaped mark between his brows throb. A protective layer of Wizard Power circulated around his body automatically. Yang Ling quickly came to his senses as the warm current of Wizard Power circulated once around his limbs and bones.</p> <p>A demoness?</p> <p>Looking at the dazed troops and adventurers around him who seemed to have been inflicted with some curse, then taking a whiff of the unique fragrance in the air, Yang Ling suddenly heightened his sense of caution. The pagoda-shaped mark between his brows only throbbed when he faced a great level of danger, and the protective Wizard Power would only circulate on its own when he encountered something unknown. It was clear that this dazzling beauty in black was not an ordinary person.</p> <p>Could she be an assassin sent by the last of the Anca family?</p> <p>Yang Ling’s pupils dilated when he saw the approaching beauty in black and recalled the heaven-ranked assassin that he could not defend himself against. He secretly formed a hand gesture. He was prepared to summon the Unicorn immediately if the situation became dire.</p> <p>Having previously experienced the shock of a surprise attack, Yang Ling understood that being careless around a top-notch killer would be fatal. Even if he possessed many more high level Magical Beasts, he might be killed in one strike if he got distracted. Magical Beasts were useless if he couldn’t summon them in time. Back when he was attacked in the fog, Yang Ling might have met his maker if that heaven-ranked assassin had come after him first.</p> <p>“One glass of rum!”</p> <p>Taking a surprised glance at the cautious Yang Ling, Maryse placed an order with the bartender John before turning to sit at a seat near the window. Soon, the fragrance in the air became duller and duller.</p> <p>The crowd only snapped out of their daydreams after hearing the magnetic voice of the beauty in black, and the bartender John was no exception. He picked up the handkerchief he had dropped onto the ground and wiped a tall crystal glass before filling it with premium rum. He then served it personally to the beauty in black.</p> <p>John gave a gentlemanly smile, wanting to flirt with the woman. Unexpectedly, aside from a faint smile, she quickly turned her head and looked silently at the Terras Mountains far away.</p> <p>After awkwardly walking back to the bar counter, John drank a cup of wine, depressed. Even though he had no power or authority back in the capital, he was still very popular with the ladies because of his handsome appearance, exceptional bartending abilities, and his ability to get into the psyche of his customers. To think that the so-called lady killer of the past was completely disregarded by the beauty in black today.</p> <p>John was depressed, but Maryse wasn’t feeling much better.</p> <p>Originally, she had expected Yang Ling to grovel under her dress like the other nobles, with her appearance and the Temptation of Darkness that she had cultivated to the fifth level. Unexpectedly, Yang Ling had quickly come to his senses after being in a daze for a moment, completely foiling her following plans.</p> <p>Interesting.</p> <p>Thinking back to her teacher’s comments, then sneaking a peek at Yang Ling by the bar counter, looking at his lazy appearance and faint smile, Maryse gritted her teeth in irritation.</p> <p>Over the years, countless men had grovelled before her. There were nobles with high status and power, great leaders who lorded over thousands of miles of land, even top-notch warriors and spellcasters. She didn’t believe that she could not charm that detestable Yang Ling</p> <p>When her teacher praised the young Yang Ling, Maryse had wanted to recruit him into the Association of Dark Magic with a few tricks to display her abilities to her teacher. She had also wanted to obtain the Dark Divine Weapon, the Snake Demon Blood Staff, along the way. Now that the target had easily avoided and dispelled her Temptation of Darkness, she felt frustration, but also curiosity after her surprise.</p> <p>Even a high level Great Swordsman or Great Spellcaster would find it hard to defend against her Temptation of Darkness. Maryse could not understand how Yang Ling, who had no Battle Energy or ripples of Magical Energy, could unravel her spell.</p> <p>Could he have a Divine Weapon that is specialized in countering Dark Magic hidden on his body?</p> <p>Maryse took a sip of the ice cold rum. It was rumored that Yang Ling was from a rich noble family with massive influence and that he spent money like water. Seeing how he threw money into the dwarf weapon shop and Shangri-La Inn, it seemed as though the rumors were true.</p> <p>Even though Divine Weapons were very rare, it was possible that an ancient family with a thousand-year legacy might have passed down one or two Divine Weapons.</p> <p>After a series of deductions, Maryse became more and more sure of her guess. As a Summoner, Yang Ling’s abilities came mainly from the Magical Beasts he summoned. His personal abilities shouldn’t be too exceptional. It wasn’t possible for him to defend himself against her Temptation of Darkness that even a high level Great Swordsman would succumb to. The only explanation was that he was equipped with a Divine Weapon that could counter her temptation.</p> <p>Hmph, the more treasures on you the better. You’ll hand them all to me when the time comes!</p> <p>After understanding the reason for her failed attempt, Maryse felt more comfortable and came up with another plan soon after. She would not only charm Yang Ling until he was head over heels for her, she was also going to make Yang Ling hand over his entire arsenal of Divine Weapons himself.</p> <p>As Maryse was deliberating silently to herself, the bar inside Shangri-La was silent. The boorish troops and adventurers were all staring straight at her marvelous figure. Be it the fair, attractive skin near Maryse’s chest, or her full breasts and perky buttocks, anywhere they looked made them feel parched.</p> <p>Usually, no one dared cause trouble within Shangri-La with Yang Ling’s reputation. Even the arrogant Black Armor Guards did not have the guts to do so, much less ordinary troops and adventurers.</p> <p>But, seeing this attractive beauty in black and under the influence of alcohol, someone soon became unable to hold it in!</p> <p>“Mi… Miss, dri… Drink with me!”</p> <p>After taking a gulp of pure pomegranate wine, a half-drunk Black Armor Guard staggered towards Maryse. His red eyes were staring straight at the attractive piece of fair white just under Maryse’s neck as he swallowed hard. His breathing was heavy, as if he wanted to strip the attractive Maryse in front of everyone, then press her down onto the table…</p> <p>Hmph, you’re asking for death!</p> <p>After taking a sip of rum and looking at the lecherous Black Armor Guard, Maryse let out a grunt. A cold gleam flashed through her eyes. In her eyes, this tall Black Armor Guard was simply asking for death.</p> <p>Curse him, turn him into a skeleton, or should I directly…</p> <p>In a mere instant, Maryse had already thought of countless ways to teach this Black Armor Guard a lesson. To a Great Spellcaster of the dark element, dealing with a drunk low level soldier was child’s play.</p> <p>Seeing that Maryse was silent and unmoving, the Black Armor Guard became more insolent, making his way before her under the influence of alcohol. “Hehe, great… great beauty, come with me if you can. I… I’ll guarantee that you’ll feel good!”</p> <p>The drunken Black Armor Guard was overcome with lust. He had long tossed military regulations to the back of his mind. At this moment, he had eyes only for the attractive Maryse. His only thoughts were of pressing her down and having sex with her. He was starved, not having touched a woman for more than ten days.</p> <p>“Oh, come with you?”</p> <p>Looking at the Black Armor Guard, his breathing getting heavier, Maryse let out a charming smile. She had come up with a plan to take things as they came, and she saw this as an opportunity to get closer to Yang Ling.</p> <p>Her smile could topple cities!</p> <p>Maryse’s Temptation of Darkness was ever present. At the sight of her thin lashes, large watery eyes, and blooming smile, even the adventurers and troops around them were caught in a daze, much less the insolent Black Armor Guard. Their hearts were beating excitedly, almost pushing out of their chests.</p> <p>The crowd was overcome by lust, but Yang Ling felt the pagoda-shaped mark between his brows throb gently once again as he caught the faint scent of the unusual fragrance. In his surprise, he immediately circulated the protective Wizard Power, cautiously paying attention to the beauty in black’s every action.</p> <p>Just as the people were dumbfounded, Maryse let out a cold smile. She conjured a ball of purple flames without even reciting an incantation. She then tossed it straight into the open mouth of the Black Armor Guard.</p> <p>Agh!</p> <p>After letting out a pathetic cry, the Black Armor Guard fell, rolling on the ground as he howled. Soon after, his clothes had been burned to ashes, his body black and releasing a charred stench. He struggled for a little while, his limbs convulsing, before he became motionless.</p> <p>The crowd was shocked by the sudden change. They did not understand what was going on, as Maryse had moved too quickly.</p> <p>Some said that the Black Armor Guard had received divine punishment for committing many evils, and some thought that the guard had an incurable disease that acted up as he got too excited. In fact, some even took the opportunity to step out in front of Maryse to shield her like a guardian, hoping that they would be able to get close to her this way.</p> <p>Maryse feigned fear and jumped up after letting out a screech. She fled from the seat near the window like a helpless lamb, pretending to charge toward the bar where Yang Ling was sitting.</p> <p>Maryse had thought that she had executed the plan flawlessly, and she was pretending to be a pitiful sheep. But what she did not expect was that Yang Ling’s senses were sharp after having advanced to the level of Spirit Wizard. Coupled with the fact that he had been secretly observing her actions, Yang Ling had seen what she really did.</p> <p>Ruthless, merciless, powerful!</p> <p>Seeing the beauty in black incinerate the Black Armor Guard in one move, Yang Ling’s heart shook even though his expression did not change. It looked like she was a killer indeed. She would either not strike, or kill with one blow if she did.</p> <p>Haha, they have finally come!</p> <p>Examining Maryse’s expert acting as she came toward him, Yang Ling let out a cold smile. Maybe he could have passed it off if Maryse hadn’t moved toward him, but her charging over more or less confirmed that she was a topnotch assassin hired by the enemy. She was a powerful killer that could cast spells in an instant, just like the heaven-ranked assassin he had encountered before.</p> <p>Yang Ling secretly deliberated, his senses on full alert. At the same time, Maryse looked at the lazy Yang Ling at the bar not far away, then she looked at the shiny floor. Having no idea that she had already been exposed, Maryse came up with a marvelous plan.</p>",
  "Chapter 88: Chapter 53 (Vol. 2)": "<p>Seeing the blushing Maryse approaching him, Yang Ling could not help but become nervous. The outcome of a duel between experts was often decided in an instant. As a precaution, Yang Ling secretly summoned a Horned Bee Beast to protect himself.</p> <p>While the Unicorn was powerful, it was too obvious and would alert the enemy if summoned. The Horned Bee Beast, however, had limited abilities, but it also had a small body. That was definitely a necessity when it came to assassinations and surprise attacks with its sharp fangs, lightning fast speed, and poisonous stingers.</p> <p>Premium, the cream of the crop of beautiful ladies!</p> <p>Looking at Maryse’s slender waist and supple breasts, Yang Ling could not help but steal a few more glances. He had seen his fair share of beauties, but he had never seen such a treasure like this, whose every action was attractive.</p> <p>Soulful large eyes, sexy red lips, toned and slender legs… In fact, even her posture as she took every step radiated a temptation that penetrated deep into the bones of an observer, giving them fanciful thoughts.</p> <p>Taking a sip of the ice-cold rum, Yang Ling gently bit his tongue and forced himself to calm down. He tried his best to circulate the Wizard Power and life force in his body, then secretly grabbed a bunch of Wizard Amulets. With the Horned Bee Beast and Wizard Amulets to buy time, Yang Ling believed that he would have time to summon his Magical Beast army even if he encountered a heaven-ranked assassin.</p> <p>After the battle with the Gargoyles in Valenia Valley, even though Yang Ling had exhausted a large amount of Wizard Amulets, he was now more familiar with the technique of using the Wizard Amulets. In the past, he could only activate one amulet at a time. But now, he could now activate five Wizard Amulets at once, and so his abilities had received a huge boost.</p> <p>Enemies might be able to avoid five Palm Lightning Wizard Amulets with high speed or take it head on with heavy armor. But activating five different Wizard Amulets such as Palm Lightning, Sky Blasting Cannon, and Dolphin Sonar at the same time would definitely be an enemy’s nightmare.</p> <p>Caught off guard, an average person would definitely sustain some damage.</p> <p>Is this a fragrance, or some special spell?</p> <p>Looking at the troops around him, almost having a nosebleed, then taking a whiff of the unique fragrance in the air, Yang Ling knew that the beauty in black before him had once again used her vixen-like temptation. The unique fragrance was faint and could be hidden from an average person, but Yang Ling noticed the difference easily given his heightened senses after advancing to the level of Spirit Wizard.</p> <p>Could this be another extraordinary date?</p> <p>Looking at the scheming beauty in black approaching him, Yang Ling did not dare be careless. In the past, the female assassin called Gulania had tried time and time again to assassinate him. To think that it would be a poisonous scorpion-like lady this time.</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head. The love lives of others were never ending and filled with happiness, but his love life was filled with encounters that would take his life if he was careless.</p> <p>Yang Ling was cautious, but when Maryse saw that he was staring at her without blinking, she thought that her target was already on the hook. She shot him a flirty look after a letting out a proud smile, then pretended to sprain her leg and fall toward the ice-cold floor with a cry.</p> <p>Are there any cats that do not like fish, and are there any men who are not lecherous?</p> <p>Maryse believed that under the influence of her Temptation of Darkness at close range, even a Sword Saint or Magical Tutor who had a strong determination would rush forward to save her. The young Yang Ling would be no exception. But, just as her gaze landed on Yang Ling taking a few steps back in shock, she knew that her calculations were wrong.</p> <p>They were completely wrong!</p> <p>Despite that realization, it was already too late. Having lost her balance, she could no longer react in time. She fell hard on the ice-cold floor.</p> <p>Even more unluckily, her entire dress was blown up by a cold wind. Her full buttocks and pink underwear were exposed to the entirety of the crowd, much less her upper thigh.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, am I seeing things!”</p> <p>“Talk about premium, wow…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing Maryse’s exposed slender thighs, perky buttocks, and her tiny pink underwear, the crowd could not help but exclaim loudly. They opened their eyes wide in fear of missing the opportunity to take in such a visual feast.</p> <p>The crowd was enthralled, but the embarrassed Maryse was furious. She glared at Yang Ling not far away after tightly grabbing onto her dress. She tossed her aim of tempting and controlling him to the back of her head. All she wanted to do was strangle this man who had embarrassed her.</p> <p>What was this sullen feeling, this feeling of depression? She was embarrassed to the point of fury.</p> <p>At that moment, the once radiant Maryse felt those emotions deeply. All she wanted to do was turn the b*stard Yang Ling into a skeleton with Dark Magic, a skeleton that could never be reborn.</p> <p>Yang Ling had cautiously and rapidly retreated after Maryse pretended to fall. This woman was too scheming; who knew what schemes she had? Letting a heaven-ranked assassin close to him was simply asking for death. Of course, the feast for the eyes that happened after was a complete surprise.</p> <p>The people standing directly opposite Maryse had an even more startling sight, able to see clearly even the plum blossom prints on Maryse’s little pink panties.</p> <p>Her toned, fair upper thigh, the pink panties, and a woman’s private… Merely taking a look at that would cause the blood to pulse within the body, their hearts nearly beating out of their chests.</p> <p>Haha, she is very pretty. Unfortunately, a scheme like that was too simple!</p> <p>After taking a deep breath, Yang Ling quickly came to his senses. He was sure that he would already have one foot in the grave if he had foolishly charged forward to help the beauty in black like an average person would.</p> <p>“My lady, are you okay!” Just as Maryse was about to stand up, a pair of large hands with woman-like skin helped her up.</p> <p>“Hey, to think that its Sir Leader, please have a seat, have a seat!” Yang Ling gestured to open seats. He was a little surprised when Steve gently helped the beauty in black up, not knowing when he had come in.</p> <p>Could Steve have learned that Yang Ling was providing the Rossi forces with resources and intelligence? Had Steve sent the beauty in black to assassinate Yang Ling?</p> <p>Yang Ling was a little doubtful, seeing Steve arrive at such an exact time. But he did not feel that the two of them were acting; the beauty in black was glaring furiously at Yang Ling, and Steve was beside her acting like her white knight.</p> <p>Furthermore, the situation in Wissen Town was getting more and more dire. Steve should have lost the arrogance he had previously. He should have been too busy dealing with the situation; how would he be so foolish as to send an assassin to kill Yang Ling?</p> <p>The connection between The Rossi forces and himself was hidden very well. Even an ordinary Rossi soldier would not be aware of this, much less someone outside their army. Even if Steve was suspicious of him, it would be hard for him to obtain evidence of Yang Ling being in contact with the Rossi troops.</p> <p>Yang Ling believed that unless Steve knew that he was in contact with the Rossi forces and had concrete evidence, he would not attack for the time being.</p> <p>“Miss, sit here, please!”</p> <p>Helping the attractive Maryse, Steve slowly walked toward the redwood table nearby, disregarding Yang Ling’s words. At this moment, he could only see the attractive beauty beside him.</p> <p>When he was walking past the inn a few minutes before, he became curious about how business was going. He then secretly walked in to observe the situation. He did not expect to see the attractive Maryse the moment he walked in, and he fell instantly in a daze. He only came to his senses when she fell onto the ground.</p> <p>As the son of an important finance officer in the Banto Empire, as a heredity noble, Steve had gotten everything he wanted ever since he was a child. When he grew up, the beauties that surrounded him switched around in batches. He had tried everything from lonely noble ladies to reserved daughters from rich families to gentle girls from poorer families.</p> <p>But he only realized that all of the other beauties were trash after seeing the beautiful Maryse. Compared to Maryse in her black dress, even Renee, touted as the number one beauty from the Capital Tsak Institute, looked like a dog.</p> <p>Supporting Maryse’s slender waist, smelling the faint fragrance on her body, Steve felt his heart beat faster. He did not know what love at first sight was, but he knew that he definitely had to have the mesmerizing beauty in black beside him. He secretly swore to himself that he would have her no matter what price he had to pay.</p> <p>Hehe, another lecherous demon!</p> <p>Looking at Steve, who seemed as though he had never seen a woman, Yang Ling shook his head. He knew that this beauty in black was definitely not an assassin Steve had sent.</p> <p>Words could be fabricated, but a person’s subconscious gaze revealed his true thoughts. Merely by observing them for a moment, Yang Ling knew that it was truly the first time Steve had met the beauty in black.</p> <p>Could it be that she was a killer sent by the remainder of the Anca family?</p> <p>Yang Ling creased his brows. The situation in Wissen Town was already complicated enough. If Ymir’s old father had hurried back to interfere, then the situation would become even more chaotic.</p> <p>He would be surrounded in danger if he was not careful. According to the tactician Goode, Ymir’s father was not someone to be taken lightly. He was experienced and calculating, more cunning than a fox. He was generally reserved, but if he chose to act, he would definitely create a splash.</p> <p>As Yang Ling was imagining things, Maryse was sitting on a chair and clenching her teeth in fury. In her heart, Yang Ling was the cause of her embarrassment. She swore that she would not rest until she exacted revenge for herself.</p>",
  "Chapter 89: Injustice": "<p>Maryse clenched her teeth in fury as she looked at Yang Ling, who was still smiling faintly. Whenever she thought about how he had watched her fall and not stepped forward to render assistance, her rage would flare up again. She would not let the matter rest.</p> <p>After a moment, she quickly thought of an idea to exact revenge. This time, she would use all the tricks in her arsenal, then mercilessly dump Yang Ling after he became smitten with her.</p> <p>Losing what one had just gained, that was the most tormenting thing in the world!</p> <p>A poor man would be over the moon if he suddenly obtained five million dollars. But waiting until he had gotten used to the rich man’s way of life, then turning him back into a poor man overnight? That would definitely cause him misery.</p> <p>Ever since she had started cultivating the Temptation of Darkness, Maryse had lost count of how many men she had ensnared. Some spent their entire fortunes, losing everything in order to be with her. Some disregarded the land that had been passed down to them through the generations in order to capture her heart; their only thoughts were to go traveling the world with her.</p> <p>Maryse felt that it was a grave injustice that her allure was ineffective against Yang Ling. She believed that one day, Yang Ling would grovel before her skirts like the other men, waiting for her to mercilessly dump him.</p> <p>Maryse was secretly planning her revenge, but Steve was racking his brain for a way to return home with the beauty before him. Yang Ling was silently leaning on the bar, carefully considering Maryse’s probable background and intentions.</p> <p>“Boss, this is the cocktail that I have just mixed. Can you try it and tell me how it tastes?” After patting his forehead, John had suddenly remembered Yang Ling’s instructions some time back. He had taken a pale green cocktail from the top of the wine cabinet, and he now offered it to Yang Ling.</p> <p>Yang Ling took a light sniff as he accepted the pale green cocktail. It was fragrant and rich, its taste truly exceptional. But just as he was about to pour himself a glass to drink, Steve walked quickly toward him.</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, wait a minute, I’ll buy that wine!”</p> <p>Steve had an idea after catching a sniff of that rich wine fragrance. As the saying went, great swords were to be given to heroes, and great wines to beauties. Using a bottle of good quality wine to create an atmosphere was an old practice.</p> <p>Yang Ling had seen Steve hanging around Maryse like a fly, and he would have understood the man’s intentions for purchasing the wine even if he was thinking using his toes. Thinking back to how Steve had asked for an exorbitant amount back in the castle, Yang Ling had a thought and said, “Sir Leader, I am sorry, this wine is not for sale. I’ll not sell it for any price.”</p> <p>Not sell it for any price?</p> <p>Steve froze. He turned to look at Maryse behind him, then clenched his teeth and said, “Brother Yang Ling, take it as doing me a favor; let me have the wine. You can state any price!”</p> <p>A fat lamb, an incredibly fat lamb that was sending itself to the slaughterhouse!</p> <p>Despite being elated, Yang Ling put on an act and shook his head. “Sir Leader, this is a rare Monkey Wine that has received the blessings of heaven and earth. It was created using precious treasures such as a sprig thousand-year-old knotweed gathered by a psychic orangutan, ten-thousand-year-old lingzhi, and the Flame Dragon Fruit. You only get one drop a year, one bottle every century. It is not only capable of regenerating muscle, it is even said that drinking it will grant eternal youth. Tell me, can a wine like this be measured using crystal coins?”</p> <p>One bottle a century? A rare Monkey Wine that has received the blessings of heaven and earth?</p> <p>The crowd was somewhat dazed after hearing Yang Ling’s nonsense. The bartender John almost fell to the ground. He would never have expected an ordinary cocktail to become a premium wine that could only be found once in a century through Yang Ling’s words.</p> <p>Did he just call me a monkey?</p> <p>In Yang Ling’s story, I’m the psychic orangutan, right?</p> <p>John shook his head and let out a bitter smile as he took in a few deep breaths. He had heard that Yang Ling was a Summoner and had a terrifying Magical Beast army, his abilities deep beyond comprehension. From this, John did not know exactly how powerful Yang Ling was, but he sure knew that Yang Ling’s abilities in bragging were unparalleled.</p> <p>An expert was an expert indeed; even his bragging abilities were exceptional.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling this calm and composed, even carrying a sincere smile as he spouted complete nonsense, John couldn’t help but feel in awe of Yang Ling. He knew that he could never catch up to Yang Ling in his lifetime.</p> <p>As John restrained his smile, Steve became petrified, unable to come to his senses for the longest time.</p> <p>It was too surprising!</p> <p>He could never have expected a simple bottle of wine to have such a history. Looking at the smiling Yang Ling, he couldn’t find a retort even though he knew that something was off. After all, Yang Ling had already said that it wasn’t for sale. He was the one asking for the favor now.</p> <p>It was hard for him to take back his words now!</p> <p>Looking at the troops who had gathered to watch the scene, then looking at the beautiful Maryse not far away, Steve could no longer back down now that he had already boasted. He didn’t give much regard to the gathered troops, but embarrassing himself in front of the beauty would waste his previous efforts. He clenched his teeth and soldiered on. “Brother Yang Ling, I’ll say it again. Let me have the wine, I’ll pay anything you ask!”</p> <p>Even though he had never heard of the thousand-year-old knotwood or the ten-thousand-year-old lingzhi, nor had he heard about a Monkey Wine that was only available once every century, Steve understood Yang Ling’s intentions. The man only wanted a few more crystal coins. In order to win the heart of the beauty, Steve had decided to go all out. At the very most, he was going to think of a way to extort it back from Yang Ling in the future.</p> <p>“Sir Leader, this wine is not for sale, this… You are truly making it very difficult for me!” Yang Ling shook his head, pretending to be caught in a pinch. “I have lost several hundred elite warriors in order to obtain this rare Monkey Wine. Even the money I paid as compensation to their families can be described as astronomical…” Yang Ling sighed theatrically.</p> <p>“Hmph, just state your price!” Steve clenched his teeth in anger, wanting to strangle Yang Ling to death. But in front of the beauty, all he could do was maintain the manners befitting a noble, bottling his fury and secretly considering how much money he had left.</p> <p>When he first came to Wissen Town, he had been moving quickly and hadn’t brought many Crystal Coins or resources. But he could still manage a few thousand Purple Crystal Coins. That should be enough to buy this bottle of wine.</p> <p>Yang Ling sighed.</p> <p>“Since you are so insistent, I have to let you have it!” Yang Ling took a longing whiff of the intoxicating wine fragrance, then continued, “I’ll give it to you at half price: a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins. I can’t go any lower!”</p> <p>A hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins?</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, the crowd instantly became petrified. Even Maryse was no exception, though she hadn’t really been paying attention. The bartender John, who knew that the wine was nothing special, nearly had a heart attack.</p> <p>Steve wasn’t doing very well himself. His eyes turned black as he stared blankly at Yang Ling. Originally, he had thought that Yang Ling would ask for a maximum of a few thousand Purple Crystal Coins. He hadn’t expected him to ask for such an exorbitant price. He had asked for a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins for a mere bottle of wine, then said that it was already at half price!</p> <p>Interesting, it was getting more and more interesting!</p> <p>As she watched Yang Ling running his mouth, Maryse couldn’t help but recall her teacher’s comments on him. She became even angrier at this man who appeared so lazy on the surface. At the same time, she became curious about his background. After all, no average noble would dare to ask for such an exorbitant price from the leader of a strong army.</p> <p>Oh Yiblis, why don’t I just…</p> <p>Steve’s eyes glinted in his fury. He was prepared to instruct his personal guards to take the detestable Yang Ling down. But after taking in a deep breath, thinking about the mysterious and powerful family behind Yang Ling, then thinking about his terrifying Magical Beast army and fierce guards, Steve had no choice but to back down.</p> <p>Steve took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. He was prepared to bear with this problem for now and seek revenge on Yang Ling after his reinforcements arrived. Glancing at the smiling Yang Ling, then at the gossiping troops around him, then at the beauty in black who seemed to be looking back at him with emotion in her eyes, Steve secretly thought about how much money he had left.</p> <p>Steve would’ve had a hundred ways to gather a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins if he was in the capital, but in this isolated town, even fifty thousand was a large sum, much less a hundred thousand. He wouldn’t have enough even if he were to take out all of the military funding meant for purchasing rations, unless…</p> <p>Steve had a thought as he looked at the nearly transparent Soul Ring on his right index finger, but subconsciously shook his head immediately after.</p> <p>The Soul Ring was a treasure passed down by his ancestors. It wasn’t only capable of defending him against terrifying mental attacks; it was rumored that the ring harbored a great secret. If his father knew that he had pawned this precious Soul Ring for a woman, he might immediately oust Steve from the family.</p> <p>Haha, it looks like I still have to go one step further! Yang Ling thought.</p> <p>Looking at the hesitant Steve, then looking at the beautiful Maryse at the side, Yang Ling had an idea. Why not use retreat as a form of advancement?</p> <p>“Tsk tsk, fragrant, it is indeed fragrant. It sure lives up to its name as a Monkey Wine available only once in a century, being able to regenerate muscle and grant eternal youth!” Yang Ling intentionally muttered to himself loudly. He stood up. “Sir Leader, if you are not interested, then I’ll have to leave!”</p> <p>Indeed, just as he finished saying this, Maryse let out a soft cry. She wasn’t interested in regenerating flesh and bone, but eternal youth was a fatal temptation. Even though Yang Ling’s words were absurd, she couldn’t help but give him the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>Seeing that he had successfully attracted the attention of the beauty in black, Yang Ling knew that he was one step closer to success. He intentionally walked slowly past Steve, pretending to take a whiff of the intoxicating wine fragrance.</p> <p>Seeing the bottle of wine just inches away from him, all Steve wanted to do was snatch it for himself before striking the detestable Yang Ling down with a fist. But thinking about Yang Ling’s background and abilities, Steve could only suppress this alluring thought.</p> <p>Looking back to the captivated Maryse, then looking at Yang Ling who was brushing past him, Steve felt a heat go past his brain. He decided to go all out. “Brother Yang Ling, this is the Soul Ring passed down by the Waize family. It can defend against mental attacks and is definitely worth a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins. Take it!”</p> <p>After stuffing the ring into Yang Ling’s hand, Steve didn’t hesitate to snatch the “Monkey Wine that could grant eternal youth.” He swore secretly in his heart that he would return to punish the brazen Yang Ling after he had eradicated the Rossi faction. He would force Yang Ling to obediently cough up the ring that he was temporarily loaning to Yang Ling. Yang Ling would give it back to him with interest.</p>",
  "Chapter 90: Another Extortion": "<p>When he took the nearly transparent Soul Ring, Yang Ling had originally felt that it wasn’t worth it and prepared to ask Steve for another treasure. But unexpectedly, as he slipped the ring on his finger, he felt a familiar ripple of Wizard Power radiating from the ring.</p> <p>A ring that possesses Wizard Power?</p> <p>In his curiosity, Yang Ling carefully injected a shred of Wizard Power into the ring. Soon, a layer of shining silver light started pulsing on the surface of the ring. The ring also released a chilly energy, rapidly circulating into Yang Ling’s limbs. Yang Ling instantly became more energized.</p> <p>Could this be one of the fabled Wizard Treasures?!</p> <p>Yang Ling thought back to the records on the stele and became exceptionally joyful. His abilities would definitely increase by leaps and bounds now that he had such a powerful treasure. He would, at the very least, be able to preserve his life when he encountered a powerful fighter like a heaven-ranked assassin, if not defeat his enemy in one move.</p> <p>A treasure like this was worth a million Purple Crystal Coins, much less a hundred thousand!</p> <p>Just as he was about to further investigate his unexpected gain, Steve walked over with large strides. “Brother Yang Ling, do you still have a premium room open?”</p> <p>Oh Yiblis, they’re getting a room this soon?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head. The relationship of this wanton couple sure progressed faster than a rocket. They had just met and had a few sips of alcohol, and now they were already prepared to get a room. He had wanted to tease Steve, but he paused as he saw the beauty in black walking slowly toward him.</p> <p>Perhaps it was due to the alcohol, but Maryse’s face was a little red. Her skin looked like it would be smooth as silk to the touch. She unintentionally let out a wave of captivating allure, making the bartender John who was watching from the side a little parched. Even Yang Ling couldn’t help but swallow.</p> <p>It’s unfortunate that she has other motives, and her intentions are evil. Otherwise, this lady would be a perfect lover!</p> <p>Yang Ling came to his senses after shaking his head. He said calmly, “Sir Leader, I am sorry, we don’t have plans for leasing our rooms on an hourly rate for the time being!”</p> <p>Hourly rate?</p> <p>The drunk Steve was a little confused when he heard Yang Ling say this, unable to figure out what he meant by leasing rooms out on an hourly rate. Maryse wanted to stay in Wissen Town for a period of time, and Steve trying to please her, so he was just asking Yang Ling for a room.</p> <p>“Boss, the construction on the villas that we’re adding to Shangri-La is almost finished. We can rent one out for the time being!”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling reject Steve, John couldn’t help but interrupt. It wasn’t because John had any respect for the leader Steve; he just hoped he’d get to see the beautiful figure of the beauty in black every day if she stayed in the inn. Even if he was unable to have her, catching a glimpse or two more of her was also a form of enjoyment.</p> <p>This beauty was stunning indeed, truly exceptional!</p> <p>Seeing John’s eyeballs about to fall out of their sockets, Yang Ling shook his head.</p> <p>It’s said that a woman’s body is her most important asset. It looks like that’s true indeed. Beauties received a warm welcome wherever they go. Even John, who normally treats others with a cold arrogance, is no exception.</p> <p>“There are indeed a few more villas, but they have all been booked by others. I would have to pay a large sum of crystal coins if I were to default on the contracts. Sir Leader, why not look for a room somewhere else!” Yang Ling gave an apologetic smile before continuing, “Even if someone was willing to give up their rooms, the rent here is eighty Purple Crystal Coins a day, so it’s not worth it to stay in a villa alone!”</p> <p>Yang Ling denied Steve’s request. The beauty in black was of unknown background and was vicious and powerful. He wasn’t willing to place such a powerful ticking bomb near him.</p> <p>Eighty Purple Crystal Coins a day?</p> <p>The crowd was shocked, and even John was no exception. He hadn’t expected the original price tag of fifty Purple Crystal Coins a day to suddenly jump to eighty Purple Crystal Coins a day.</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, that price is too ridiculous. It’s not beneficial to the development of our land. Even though we are brothers, I will feel very conflicted if you continue to act like this!” Steve had a thought as he saw the crowd shaking their heads. He brought out his status as a leader, hoping to put pressure on the detestable Yang Ling.</p> <p>Steve was furious after having been extorted by Yang Ling. If not for his wariness of Yang Ling’s abilities and family, if not for having to maintain his demeanor as a gentleman in front of the beauty in black, he would have ordered his personal guards to charge forward. How could he have missed the opportunity to deal a blow to Yang Ling?</p> <p>Yang Ling understood Steve’s intentions without having to think too deeply into it, now that Steve had intentionally highlighted his status as a leader. Looking at the lecherous Steve, then looking at the beauty in black behind him, her every movement filled with a certain allure, Yang Ling immediately thought of a counterattack.</p> <p>“Sir Leader, you are wronging me. These crystal coins are all going to be handed over to you as tax. I can barely even keep the inn running, much less turn a profit!”</p> <p>The crystal coins were to be handed over to me? Steve wondered.</p> <p>After patting his dizzy head, Steve suddenly remembered the deal they had made back at Wissen Castle. He knew that his plan had backfired.</p> <p>Indeed, after Yang Ling’s reminder, the crowd suddenly recalled the triangle eyes Midhart, who had been hounding them for money every other day. They broke into a commotion, all pointing their spears toward the bloodsucker Steve.</p> <p>“Dozens of purple coins in tax for a villa?” Maryse subconsciously shook her head after she understood what was going on. She looked at Steve, who had been manically collecting taxes, in disbelief.</p> <p>Steve became awkward, seeing that Yang Ling’s words had ignited Maryse’s confusion and dissatisfaction. He wanted to slap himself. He would have wasted his efforts if the beauty in black had a bad impression of him after Yang Ling’s words.</p> <p>What do I do now?</p> <p>Facing the seemingly dissatisfied Maryse, facing the troops and adventurers pointing fingers at him, Steve wasn’t sure how to respond. He wanted to maintain his demeanor of a white knight in front of the beauty, but he could not bear to part with the crystal coins he could gain from Shangri-La every day.</p> <p>Oh Yiblis, I’ll let Yang Ling have the upper hand for a few days. I’ll make sure he pays for it in the future, when my reinforcements arrive!</p> <p>After a moment’s hesitation, Steve clenched his teeth and said, “Our most difficult time in Wissen Town has passed. In order to thank all of you for your support, from today on, taxes on Shangri-La and the rest of the inns shall return to normal. We will only collect a symbolic sum of a few Purple Crystal Coins daily!”</p> <p>Rent will return to normal?</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, the troops and adventurers cried out in joy. They had seen how the entire event played out, and they were all in awe of Yang Ling. If not for Yang Ling’s ingenious counterattack, directly targeting Steve’s desire to avoid embarrassing himself in front of the beauty, this detestable leader would never have been so kind as to voluntarily decrease the taxes!</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, surely you will have extra villas now!” Looking at the man who had repeatedly caused him to suffer losses, Steve clenched his jaws in anger.</p> <p>“Let me discuss this with the guests and see if I can squeeze out a villa!” After receiving that welcome surprise, Yang Ling’s smile became even more radiant.</p> <p>D*mn it, could this b*stard have lost interest in women? Maryse wondered.</p> <p>When Yang Ling not only avoided falling for her allure but also rejected the idea of her staying in Shangri-La, Maryse couldn’t help but doubt her own charms. Over all her years of using magic, this was the first time she had encountered a man who wasn’t moved by her.</p> <p>But after close observation, she saw how Yang Ling would steal peeks at her perky breasts just like the other men. She immediately overturned her unwarranted guesses.</p> <p>It looks like the b*stard is still interested in women, but he’s also especially concerned about his reputation, she thought.</p> <p>Over the years, she had seen many such men. They would pretend to be decent men, but they were all lecherous demons behind closed doors. They would all tear off a woman’s clothes while calling her their darling.</p> <p>Maryse believed that if she managed to stay in Shangri-La, she would have the chance to be alone with Yang Ling sooner or later. After a moment’s deliberation, she came up with another idea. She believed that Yang Ling would definitely show his true colors then and grovel before her.</p> <p>***</p> <p>There were two sides to every coin, and with every negative came a positive!</p> <p>Maryse staying in Shangri-La was akin to planting a time bomb beside him. But at the same time, Yang Ling noticed that business in the bar was busier than usual.</p> <p>Troops and adventurers who had nothing to do would hang around in the bar for the entire day, waiting for the breath-taking Maryse to appear. Even if they could not have her for themselves, catching glimpses of her was also a form of enjoyment. Naturally, the more they drank, the more crystal coins they spent, much to the elation of the old butler Murbaqi who was in charge of the accounts.</p> <p>Every time the alluring Maryse appeared, she attracted the eyeballs of everyone present, their naked gazes sweeping over her notable areas like daggers. If having lecherous intentions was a crime, these troops and adventurers would have been executed many times over.</p> <p>The troops hung around the bar every day, while the leader Steve also visited uninvited. He would stick around Maryse like a fly, pouring her drinks and treating her with passion, like a true lecherous noble.</p> <p>If Steve hadn’t needed to manage so many things personally, he might have booked another room in Shangri-La and stayed by Maryse’s side day and night.</p>",
  "Chapter 91: I’m Not a Wanton Man": "<p>Having received more accurate information since Yang Ling’s return, the Rossi forces managed to launch a few successful sneak attacks. The patrolling Black Armor Guards felt insecure, and in order to conserve their strength, Steve took the advice of his tactician and greatly narrowed the patrolling radius of his troops.</p> <p>In addition, he increased the number of men in each patrol team to a hundred. The patrol teams were now equipped with archers and spellcasters, so their abilities received a huge boost. The Rossi soldiers launching sneak attacks couldn’t do anything against that. At the same time, in order to control the worsening situation, Steve had asked for aid from the capital. He used the justification that the Rossi government was sending a large group of elite forces, hoping that he would receive a large amount of resources and reinforcements as well.</p> <p>Steve believed that with the mediation of his father and allied families, he would soon receive the reinforcements and resources. If he could last a little longer until the reinforcements and resources arrived, he would then be able to conduct a large scale search and completely defeat the Rossi forces.</p> <p>At that point, foreign troops, the local Wissen townspeople, and the powerful Yang Ling would all have to obey him and follow his every command.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Renaya knew that the situation was getting worse for him, given the information he received from his spies in the Banto Empire and the constant failed attempts at sneak attacks. The Rossi Empire was far away from Wissen Town. There was no way for him to arrange for a large number of reinforcements in such a short amount of time. If he wanted to successfully complete the mission of foiling the Banto Empire’s plans, he could only pin his hopes on Yang Ling.</p> <p>Yang Ling disregarded the Rossi faction’s multiple requests for them to attack together. He only told Goode to increase the aid he gave in terms of intelligence and material resources. It still wasn’t that right time for him to have a falling out with Steve. Attacking now would only benefit the Rossi forces for free.</p> <p>Yang Ling sent his scouts to observe Maryse for a while, but he was a little confused when he found out that she spent her days either traveling or killing time in Shangri-La’s bar. He couldn’t understand the intentions of this devil. Either Yang Ling was just overly-paranoid, or Maryse was a topnotch killer whose abilities ran deep. Maybe she was still waiting for the right time to land a surefire killing blow.</p> <p>He had to plan for the worst case scenario. Yang Ling would rather believe that Maryse was a topnotch killer hiding her abilities than let his guard down. He seized the time to train, and he ordered Goode to continue digging up information on her background.</p> <p>One night, after having trained continuously for three days, Yang Ling walked toward Shangri-La with large strides, more than ready for a drink or two. He had just settled himself at the bar when Maryse slowly walked in front of him, bringing with her a faint fragrance.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, you came at a good time. The doors and windows of my villa keep getting trashed by someone. Can you come check it out for me?”</p> <p>Perhaps it was because she had just gotten out of the shower, but water dripped from Maryse’s bunned up hair from time to time. One could see a thin piece of undershirt hugging her slender body through her unzipped jacket. She was perky where she needed to be, releasing a fatal allure. Even Yang Ling felt a little parched looking at her, and a strange urge filled both him and the troops around them.</p> <p>“Miss, you can ask one of the guards for help with something like that. They will help you solve it!” Yang Ling took a deep breath and tried his best to calm down.</p> <p>Yang Ling did not dare be careless, even though Maryse couldn’t be hiding any weapons under her thin garments. At the level of a heaven-ranked assassin, even a strand of hair or a fallen leaf might be used as a deadly weapon. Furthermore, they also had those instant spells that were hard to defend against.</p> <p>An assassin’s spell might be simple and mundane compared to a spell slowly cast by a spellcaster, but it was very practical. Yang Ling didn’t wish for his mouth to be stuffed with a purple flame while he was talking to Maryse, murdered in an instant like the unlucky Black Armor Guard she had killed the first night he saw her.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, you can call me Maryse in the future!” Maryse gave Yang Ling a distant gaze, then said pitifully, “Sir Yang, I have already gotten the guards to look at it, but the problem hasn’t been solved. Could you bear to see a helpless lady like me get bullied?”</p> <p>Helpless lady?</p> <p>As he watched Maryse pretending to be pitiful, then looked at her large watery eyes that were slowly filling with tears, Yang Ling felt his hair stand on end. He couldn’t help but feel in awe of her acting skills. If he hadn’t witnessed her killing the Black Armor Guard and detected her subtle manipulation magic, he might not have believed that such a beauty would be a merciless, cold-blooded killer.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling remain unmoved despite Maryse’s pleas, even the busy bartender John could not look on any longer. “Boss, Jarlock and the rest have been there to take a look. They truly cannot solve the problem. This might be something that really requires your personal attention.”</p> <p>“John, why don’t you go deal with it? I’ll give you half a day off!”</p> <p>Seeing that John was obviously pleading for Maryse, then looking at the troops and adventurers pointing fingers at him, Yang Ling shook his head and let out a bitter laugh.</p> <p>This femme fatale sure lives up to her name. If I push her away any longer, I might truly invoke the anger of the crowd.</p> <p>Yang Ling came up with an idea after a moment’s deliberation. He decided to follow Maryse to see what exactly she was planning. Of course, as a precaution, he secretly grabbed a handful of Wizard Amulets from his robe.</p> <p>“Alright, it is my honor to be serving you. Miss Maryse, please!”</p> <p>Seeing that Yang Ling had finally taken the hook, Maryse let out a faint, cold smile, leading the way after she took a bow. Behind her, Yang Ling couldn’t help but swallow. At the instant she bowed, he saw her pair of fair bunnies, firm, full, and inviting…</p> <p>Did she really only have such a loose undershirt under her jacket?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head. It looks like Ymir’s father had indeed put in a lot of effort in order to deal with him, even finding such a premium, beautiful assassin.</p> <p>A slender figure, flexible waist, and perky butt, coupled with her ever-present allure… Those things were already powerful weapons. Luckily, his concentration had improved greatly after absorbing a large amount of green life force. Otherwise, he might have fallen for her tricks long before.</p> <p>After making their way past a bamboo forest, Yang Ling followed Maryse to a silent villa. The windows of the master bedroom and bathroom had indeed been broken. But weirdly, there were no signs of anyone entering the villa to steal anything. There were also no playful children nearby, so who could have done such a thing?</p> <p>“Sir Yang Ling, you have to investigate this thoroughly. Otherwise, how will I dare sleep alone at night?” Maryse said as she closed in on Yang Ling. She bent her slender waist, propping up her supple butt as she investigated the shattered windows beside him.</p> <p>In that instant, smelling her faint fragrance, looking at her fair skin inches away from him, Yang Ling felt his blood boil. His private parts involuntarily went erect. Even worse, it was propped right between Maryse’s supple butt cheeks.</p> <p>“Ah, sir, you..” After being suddenly prodded by Yang Ling, Maryse shuddered, as if she was struck by lightning. She turned pale as she looked at Yang Ling’s privates standing tall. Even though she was intentionally tempting him, she hadn’t expected Yang Ling’s reaction to be this strong.</p> <p>After her surprise, Maryse let out a proud smile. She wasn’t afraid of Yang Ling’s large reaction; she had been more afraid that he wouldn’t have a reaction at all, as if he was a eunuch. She now believed that with a little more effort, Yang Ling would become like a dog awaiting her orders, just like the other men.</p> <p>“Sir Yang Ling, what’s wrong with this weather? It’s so warm I’m sweating, even though it’s in the middle of winter!”</p> <p>Maryse slowly unbuttoned the top two buttons of her jacket as she said this. Her alluring body was faintly exposed. Her perky twin peaks, muscular thighs, and a woman’s most private… In that instant, Yang Ling thought blood was going to start gushing out of his nose.</p> <p>The ultimate honey trap?</p> <p>Looking at Maryse, who seemed to be allowing him to do whatever he wanted, then looking at her alluring body, Yang Ling swallowed hard. He forcefully calmed himself down. “Miss Maryse, if your body is so warm, are you feeling unwell?”</p> <p>“Yes, Sir Yang, I am feeling unwell. Help me find out what exactly is wrong with me, would you?” Maryse’s eyes were glazed over, and she leaned toward Yang Ling as she spoke. She instinctively cast her Temptation of Darkness.</p> <p>Yang Ling would fall under her full controlled as long as she managed to pierce through Yang Ling’s mental defenses and plant the seed of desire in his brain. He would definitely obey her every command.</p> <p>At the critical moment, the pagoda-shaped brand on Yang Ling’s forehead started to pulse vigorously once again. The protective Wizard Power rapidly circulated within his body, forcefully defending against the mental attacks of the Temptation of Darkness. At the same time, the Soul Ring on his right index finger released an icy chill that circulated once around his body. Yang Ling instantly felt refreshed.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, as long as it’s convenient for you, my door will always be open for you!” Leaning into Yang Ling, Maryse moaned beside his ear, trying her best to ignite his feelings of lust.</p> <p>“Miss Maryse, regrettably, I’m not a wanton man!” Coming to his senses, Yang Ling found Maryse in his arms, and he immediately pushed her away. He quickly retreated as if he had seen a ghost, a bunch of Wizard Amulets in his hand.</p> <p>Originally, he had wanted to seize the opportunity to bring down this demon, but after sensing her booming ripples of Magical Energy at close distance, Yang Ling did not dare act recklessly. At this moment, it was better for him to retreat.</p> <p>“B*stard, I’ll kill you!”</p> <p>Seeing that Yang Ling had come to his senses and left her villa at the critical moment, Maryse clenched her teeth in fury. All she wanted to do was chase after him and turn him into a skeleton using her dark magic.</p>",
  "Chapter 92: Friend from Afar": "<p>Yang Ling had just left when an elder in black walked into the villa through a ripple in thin air. His appearance was hazy, as if his body devoured any light that got too close.</p> <p>“Teacher!” Maryse bowed respectfully when she saw the figure of the elder in black, even though she was clenching her teeth in fury.</p> <p>“Maryse, you were wrong, you were utterly wrong!” Looking at the fuming Maryse, the elder in black gently shook his head. “I have told you before; the young lad Yang Ling is not simple. Even though he cannot use Battle Energy or Magical Energy, he has a strange power in his body. Your Temptation of Darkness might have won over countless other men, but it’s counterproductive when used against him!”</p> <p>Counterproductive?</p> <p>After hearing the elder’s words and remembering Yang Ling’s avoidance and faint hostility toward her, Maryse reached an epiphany. “Teacher, are you saying that Yang Ling is acting wary and hostile towards me because I used the Temptation of Darkness?”</p> <p>“That’s right. You miscalculated the first time you met him, then continued to make mistakes in further encounters!” The elder in black paused, then continued, “A sole, thriving person like Yang Ling will definitely have many enemies. You abruptly used mental attacks against him the first time you met him. Of course that made him cautious and caused a misunderstanding!”</p> <p>“Teacher, what should we do now?”</p> <p>After understanding what was going on, Maryse quickly calmed herself down. Now that it had come to this, there was no use for regret. To successfully complete the mission, she would have to dispel the misunderstanding between her and Yang Ling. Only by dispelling Yang Ling’s misapprehensions could she hope that he would grovel before her one day, giving her the revenge she desired.</p> <p>In this world, the only person that could awe Maryse was the elder in black before her. Maryse knew that her teacher would be her lighthouse whenever she was faced with difficulties, be it in magic or tactics. If not for her teacher turning the tides with his foresight, the Association of Dark Magic would have been defeated by the Church long ago.</p> <p>“Maryse, until you reach the seventh level, you are not to use the Temptation of Darkness on Yang Ling again. Remember that!” Seeing Maryse compose herself in such a short amount of time, the elder in black gave an approving nod. “A man like Yang Ling weighs risks and benefits carefully. At this point, you must make your identity clear to him. Only by making him understand your worth can you get near him and successfully complete the mission!”</p> <p>Yang Ling’s abilities were nothing exceptional, but the family behind him was a different story. The elder believed that any faction would pay any price to get a family of Ancient Summoners on their side.</p> <p>As an elder of the Association of Dark Magic, the elder in black would definitely not miss such a good opportunity. If he could summon a large number of dark element Magical Beasts using the abilities of the family of Ancient Summoners behind Yang Ling, the abilities of the Association of Dark Magic would improve by leaps and bounds within a short span of time.</p> <p>Roping Yang Ling in was a must, but he had to be attentive to how it was done.</p> <p>Going too far is as bad as not going far enough!</p> <p>If he was too impatient, he might earn Yang Ling’s animosity instead of his interest. That would be foolish, and the elder in black did not wish for Maryse to do anything foolish. After giving the impulsive Maryse a few reminders, he waved the staff in his hand and instantly teleported away. Only a faint ripple of Magical Energy remained in his wake. He came and went without a trace.</p> <p>Roping in the family behind Yang Ling was important, but he had a more important thing to do at this point in time. He had to find the relic where the Holy Dragon Ayrpaciro sealed the Undead Divine Weapons, and he had to do it quickly.</p> <p>The reason that the Association of Dark Magic was losing to the Church of Light was because the Church had a few powerful Divine Weapons. If he could find the sealed Undead Divine Weapons, the Association of Dark Magic would at the very least be able to defend themselves against the attacks of the Church, if not exterminate the Church of Light entirely.</p> <p>Maryse’s head was still hanging low in thought, even after the elder in black had been gone for some time. Even though her teacher hadn’t reprimanded her, she could still understand the intentions within her teacher’s words. The family behind Yang Ling was exceptional, she shouldn’t act impulsively.</p> <p>Making her identity clear and letting Yang Ling know her worth?</p> <p>Maryse thought back to Steve, the Leader of Wissen who had fallen for her at first sight. When she considered Yang Ling’s unfriendly attitude toward the man, Maryse knew that conflict would erupt between them sooner or later. She soon had a preliminary plan. Even though the abilities of the Association of Dark Magic had declined greatly under the attacks of the Church, propping up a small faction in the desolate Wissen Town still wouldn’t be a problem.</p> <p>Maryse was planning her new course of action. At the same time, Yang Ling was rushing back to Wissen Castle under the protection of a large group of guards.</p> <p>Along the way, Yang Ling broke out in cold sweat as he recalled how he almost succumbed to the temptation. Maryse’s allure and mental attacks were too powerful. He had almost fallen for her schemes. If not for having Wizard Power and the Soul Ring protecting him, he might have already met his maker.</p> <p>Twisting the Soul Ring on his right index finger, Yang Ling knew that this was a treasure he could not get too many of. He was prepared to spend some time examining it and thinking about how he could use it.</p> <p>Until he advanced to the level of Earth Wizard and concentrated his Wizard Core, the Wizard Amulets were the only things he could depend on for his offense and defense. He would have no time to summon Magical Beasts to aid in battle if he encountered a terrifying opponent on the level of a heaven-ranked assassin. When that time came, he needed treasures like the ring that he could use freely.</p> <p>Walking quickly past the heavily guarded gates, Yang Ling had wanted to head straight to the villa where he trained. But unexpectedly, the old butler walked toward him excitedly. “Sir, you are finally back. Miss Harribell has been waiting for you in the hall for many hours. She came especially to thank you for saving her father’s life!”</p> <p>“Alright, show me the way!”</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, Yang Ling recalled Harribell and her unique demeanor, then walked toward the meeting room with large strides. Over the months, it was due to her help that he had been able to quickly recruit the various craftsmen that he needed. If not for her massive support, there was no telling when he would finish investigating the whereabouts of Goode’s family with his abilities alone.</p> <p>As he approached, he could hear laughter coming from the meeting hall. Harribell, who was dressed in white, had established a rapport with Alice and the rest shortly after arriving and was giving various gifts to the people around Yang Ling. She gave a hairpin to Alice, a coat to Argus… They all seemed to be small gifts, but the items were all made by masters and couldn’t be purchased outside even if they had money. She quickly obtained the fancy of the group.</p> <p>Harribell quickly walked forward when she saw Yang Ling. “Sir Yang Ling, my father has recovered after consuming your Water from the Spring of Life. Thank you for your benevolence!”</p> <p>“It was but a small favor, you need not be too polite. Also, you can just call me Yang Ling in the future!” Yang Ling had a glow in his eyes when he looked at Harribell in her white, flowy dress.</p> <p>Graceful and presentable, calm and composed, bright eyes and white teeth… Yang Ling saw the shadow of a successful city leader in Harribell.</p> <p>It was hard being a woman. It was harder being a successful female merchant. He couldn’t help but feel in awe of Harribell, with her business spreading all over the Tailun Continent.</p> <p>“Alright, I’ll call you Yang Ling in the future!” Harribell let out a graceful smile. “My father wanted to visit you personally to thank you, but he is still feeling a little weak and cannot come personally, please forgive him! I have brought a few small gifts to express my thanks, please accept them!”</p> <p>After bowing, Harribell shot a glance toward the old butler Murbaqi at the side. The latter understood and clapped his hands gently. Soon, the servants started carrying in boxes of presents.</p> <p>Two hundred barrels of Raphael Red Wine that were a century old.</p> <p>A hundred purebred Silver-winged Pegusi.</p> <p>Ten carts of premium Dark Fire Crystals.</p> <p>Two hundred expert craftsmen.</p> <p>A hundred female maids.</p> <p>Three hundred high level swordsmen.</p> <p>…</p> <p>With Murbaqi’s hails of celebration, the servants carried in crates of gifts. Other than the crystal coins, Dark Fire Crystals, and warhorses, there were also a bunch of craftsmen, maids, and warriors. The vast meeting hall suddenly became packed.</p> <p>These are small presents to express her thanks?</p> <p>Looking at the countless treasures, then looking at the large group of people before him, Yang Ling shook his head. How is this a small present? This is too extravagant! The rich sure live up to expectations; nothing they do is ordinary.</p> <p>“Miss Harribell, your ‘small gifts’ are too extravagant. I can’t take these. I might not even be able to feed such a large group of people!” Even though the gifts were great, suddenly having six hundred more people gave Yang Ling a bit of a headache.</p> <p>He hadn’t opened a channel to sell Magical Beast Essence Crystals. It would be decent if the dwarf weapon shop and Shangri-La could turn a small profit, or enough to cover their expenses. Suddenly having over six hundred people would fritter away his fortune. He might really become bankrupt one day.</p> <p>Harribell was intelligent, and she immediately understood Yang Ling’s concerns from his tone. “Yang Ling, you need not worry; they are all registered slaves. All you have to do is provide them with simple meals and living quarters. There’s no need for any additional expenses!”</p> <p>Yang Ling heaved a sigh of relief. If he only needed to care about their meals and living quarters, Yang Ling could take in six thousand people, much less six hundred. Wissen Castle was immensely large, and he had a good number of vacant rooms even though many of the townspeople had moved in temporarily.</p> <p>As for rations, there was a large amount of land at the edge of Terras Forest that could be used for farming once spring came around. With the rations accumulated by the Anca family over the years, lasting through the winter wouldn’t be much of a problem.</p>",
  "Chapter 93: Worsening Situation": "<p>After Harribell’s explanation, Yang Ling noticed that there was a deep, cross-shaped brand on the forehead of every craftsman, maid, and warrior. According to the conventions of the Tailun Continent, this cross-shaped brand was the symbol for a slave.</p> <p>Slaves came from many sources, but most of them were captives of war. After every large scale war, there would be large numbers of slaves available on the market. The maids and warriors Harribell was giving Yang Ling were basically prisoners of war or commoners from the losing country.</p> <p>The lives of the slaves were tragic, as they were bought and sold like goods. They did not have any dignity or rights. In the wilderness, slaves that didn’t have a symbol of affiliation could be massacred at will, and thus, none of the slaves dared to escape. There was only one way to escape from the status of a slave, and that was to be appreciated and put in an important position by their master. That would erase the symbol of a slave and their records as a slave.</p> <p>Normally, craftsmen, beautiful ladies, and warriors had the most hope of breaking free from their enslavement. They could gain a new lease on life if they were appreciated by their masters. Otherwise, what awaited them was a cruel fate. Their descendants would all be slaves.</p> <p>Under the care of the old butler Murbaqi, the servants were soon finished with the preparations of the various presents and slaves. The meeting hall quickly regained its serenity.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, I have heard that the situation in Wissen Town recently is far from goodless than ideal. May I ask about the details?” Harribell asked Yang Ling as she took a sip of jasmine tea.</p> <p>“I’m afraid the situation isn’t less than ideal; it’s quite terrible, to be honest!” Yang Ling shook his head. “Ever since Steve appeared, the self-proclaimed leader from the Banto Empire, he has caused much trouble in Wissen Town. The town’s streets have been soaked with blood!”</p> <p>After taking a few sips of the jasmine tea Alice brought him, Yang Ling summarized the conflict between the Banto army and the Rossi forces, but glossed over how he had instigated and prolonged those conflicts. Even though Harribell was from the Livenza Alliance and was on close terms with him, one could never know the true intentions of people. It was better to be cautious.</p> <p>As the authority of the Boulade Merchant’s Association, Harribell was very intelligent. She did not mind Yang Ling glossing over the details, as she understood his concerns. After a moment’s deliberation, she spoke of the information and insight she had gathered.</p> <p>It turned out that the constant wars and the massive flooding in the south had left the Banto Empire at a massive financial deficit, their treasury empty. With no choice left, a few of the high-ranking officials set their sights on the Terras Forest and its rich resources, hoping to develop another piece of land for their rule.</p> <p>As the largest primordial forest on the Tailun Continent, the Terras Forest spanned tens of thousands of miles. It was desolate and far away, and thus, the Banto nobles regarded it as a public space. In order to avoid their enemies getting in the way of their plans, the Banto nobles kept a low profile, hoping that they could gain solid control of the land in a thousand-mile radius around Wissen Town before they announced it publicly.</p> <p>But unexpectedly, news of their activity had reached the Rossi Empire, prompting their interference.</p> <p>After hearing Harribell repeatedly emphasize that the Banto Empire was keeping a low profile, Yang Ling had a thought. He deliberated for a moment before saying, “Miss Harribell, what you mean is that the Banto Empire won’t risk the fanfare of sending a large army to occupy Wissen Town until they truly control the situation?”</p> <p>“That’s correct in theory. Terras Forest has been accepted as public domain by everyone on the continent. Even though the Banto Empire has their sights on the resources here, they won’t be willing to invite more trouble for themselves because of it!”</p> <p>After saying this, Harribell gently took a sip of the refreshing jasmine tea. In actuality, thanking Yang Ling for his benevolence wasn’t the only reason she had come to Wissen Town. She was also here to execute a secret mission.</p> <p>The Livenza Alliance, situated between the Banto and Rossi Empires, maintained a neutral position. If the Banto nobles obtained the rich resources in the Terras Forest, it might break the delicate balance of power between the Banto and Rossi Empires.</p> <p>Any successful merchant’s association would have tens of thousands of connections with the government of their home nation, and the Boulade Merchant’s Association was no exception. Thus, when a messenger of the Alliance sought them out, Harribell did not decline to their requests immediately.</p> <p>On the larger scale, foiling the plans of the Banto nobles would benefit everyone within the Alliance. But from the point of view of the merchant’s association, monopolizing the resources in Terras Forest would mean that the power and wealth of the Boulade Merchant’s Association would quickly increase by leaps and bounds.</p> <p>After understanding the plans of the Banto Empire, Yang Ling rubbed his temples as he considered how he could obtain the greatest profit from this conflict. With his current abilities, trying to fight the Banto Empire head on would be like throwing eggs at a rock. He had no chance of winning. But if the Banto Empire had other considerations that made them hesitant to act, Yang Ling would have a chance, a chance to take advantage of the crisis for large personal gain.</p> <p>He had gone with the flow ever since arriving in this foreign world. He hadn’t wished to build an empire; all he had hoped for was to comfortably enjoy his new life and one day find a way back to Earth.</p> <p>Originally, he had wanted to set up a few shops in Wissen Town and build his own merchant team when the time was right. That would allow him to enjoy the life of a rich person, and it would also allow those who followed him to live life without worry for food or clothing.</p> <p>But when Steve appeared out of nowhere, Yang Ling had felt threatened. Without powerful abilities, without status, even living on to the next day might be a problem, much less living a comfortable life and building his own merchant team.</p> <p>Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun!</p> <p>Originally, Yang Ling had hoped to complicate the situation in Wissen Town using the sneak attacks of the Rossi forces, giving Steve no time to think about Yang Ling. Now that he understood the delicate balance between the various empires and the Banto Empire’s plans, Yang Ling had clear plans for the first time. Wissen Town was the camp that he was going to build his life around; it was his gateway to exploring this world. He would not allow anyone to pollute this place.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s wavering expression, Harribell knew that he was going through a difficult decision. She was silent, not speaking a word, as she sipped on her jasmine tea. Even though Yang Ling did not elaborate, her spies had already made her aware of the situation in Wisen Town. She would not have accepted the request of the Alliance without a certain level of confidence, nor would she have come to Wissen Town under the guise of thanking Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Miss Harribell, might I ask how many guards you brought with you on this trip?” After thinking for a while, Yang Ling made a decision. If he was going to act, then he was going to mobilize all his resources and spare no effort.</p> <p>“I’m sorry, in order to avoid drawing suspicion, I have only led a few dozen guards here.” Harribell instantly understood Yang Ling’s intentions when she saw the cold gleam in his eyes. “Furthermore, I have received a piece of very bad news. Even though the Banto Empire won’t send an army, they have already gathered ten thousand Black Armor Guards under the name of the Waize family. They will arrive in Wissen Town soon!”</p> <p>To avoid violating the Alliance’s facade of neutrality and bringing risk to the merchant’s association, Harribell had only led a few dozen guards into Wissen Town. She was pinning her hopes of completing the mission on Yang Ling.</p> <p>After sufficient investigation, she thought that Yang Ling had both the brains and the brawn. She believed that he could defeat Steve’s three thousand Black Armor Guards before the reinforcements from the Banto Empire arrived. All he lacked was the determination to risk it all and a few premium weapons.</p> <p>Of course, Harribell had a backup army. They were the Wolf Troop Team that escorted her here.</p> <p>There was a reason why the Livenza Alliance hadn’t been defeated in over a thousand years. Other than their impressive economic power, they also had powerful soldiers. Of the ten most well-known troop teams in the Tailun Continent, five of them belonged to the alliance, and the Wolf Troop Team was the frontrunner amongst them.</p> <p>If they were needed, the Wolf Troop Team would also extend a helping hand even without Harribell’s instructions. After all, they also had a vested interest in Wissen Town. If the Banto Empire grew stronger and broke the balance with the Rossi Empire, the alliance and their relatively weaker army would be the first to suffer. Countries would fall and families would break apart. No one wanted to be a lowly slave from a defeated country.</p> <p>Ten thousand Black Armor Guards?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head and let out a bitter smile. He hadn’t expected Harribell to have brought a mere few dozen guards, nor had he expected Steve to be receiving reinforcements so quickly. If Steve’s reinforcements arrived fast enough to defeat the Rossi forces entirely, Steve would be able to turn his full attention on Yang Ling.</p> <p>The situation is getting worse!</p> <p>After his surprise, Yang Ling once again felt the disadvantage of not having enough information. If not for Harribell, he might only have learned about Steve’s reinforcements when they arrived in Wissen Town. That would have been disastrous.</p> <p>If he had gotten this information earlier, he would have hurried to come up with a plan to deal with the embattled Steve.</p> <p>Time is of the essence. I need to deal with this swiftly!</p> <p>Clenching his teeth, Yang Ling decided to risk it all. With Steve’s personality, he would definitely not allow a faction like Yang Ling’s to exist in his land. If Yang Ling was unable to gain the upper hand before Steve’s reinforcements arrived, then he’d have no choice but to run for his life.</p> <p>With more than two hundred fierce barbarians, more than a hundred elf archers, nearly three hundred high level Swordsmen, coupled with the three hundred slave warriors Harribell had given him, he had nearly a thousand men under him. His forces were equal with Steve’s.</p> <p>Yang Ling believed that if he chose the right time and launched a surprise attack with the Rossi forces, coupled with his powerful Magical Beast army, he could definitely defeat Steve’s Black Armor Guards. If he adopted the right strategy, he might even be able to exterminate all of the arrogant Steve’s forces.</p>",
  "Chapter 94: Dark Spellcaster": "<p>“Even though I didn’t bring many guards, I did bring with me a large number of new heavy crossbows!” Harribell continued after a pause. “After testing, we established that they are capable of piercing through the heavy black armor of Banto soldiers from a distance of up to thirty steps!”</p> <p>Seeing that Yang Ling had finally decided to attack personally, Harribell thought it was time to reveal her trump card. The black armor of the Banto Empire’s infantry was heavy and hardy, and its performance on the battlefield was exceptional. Originally, cavalry units were the best way to deal with Steve’s Black Armor Guards, but when it came to small-scale surprise attacks, the exquisitely crafted heavy crossbows would be more suitable.</p> <p>Looking at the crowd’s doubtful gazes, Harribell gave a confident smile. She whispered some instructions into the old butler Murbaqi’s ears. The latter obeyed the order and left. Soon he instructed a few servants to bring a large crate into the room. Yang Ling had a look at the contents as the crate was opened. They were all black, shiny heavy catapults.</p> <p>As Harribell explained, Yang Ling quickly grasped the technique for using the heavy catapults. After repeated tries, he realized that the furthest range of the heavy catapult was a hundred steps away. It could pierce through normal armor at about fifty steps, and within thirty steps, it could pierce through premium steel a few inches thick. That was more than enough to deal with Steve’s black armor.</p> <p>“Miss Harribell, this is wonderful. Might I ask how many of these heavy catapults you have?” Yang Ling gave a satisfied nod. With these heavy catapults, Yang Ling had greater confidence that he could defeat Steve’s Black Armor Guards in one fell swoop.</p> <p>Taking a sip of the jasmine tea, Harribell said, “I heard about some of the things going on in Wissen Town before I came. Thus, I brought a full five hundred heavy catapults and fifty thousand expendable arrows!”</p> <p>After his surprise, Yang Ling’s heart became filled with doubt. He might have expected it if Harribell had only brought a few dozen heavy catapults. But if she had brought five hundred heavy catapults and fifty thousand expendable arrows…</p> <p>Could Harribell be a prophet?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head. Even if Harribell knew that she had to deal with Steve, she might not have been able to prepare five hundred heavy catapults and fifty thousand expendable arrows in such a short amount of time. After all, these heavy catapults were all restricted military weapons. The only explanation for this was that Harribell had prepared for this long ago, and she had another motive for her trip here.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling looking at her doubtfully, Harribell knew that he had already begun to suspect her motive for coming here. After a moment’s deliberation, she decided to reveal the Alliance’s request. In fact, she didn’t even hide the fact that she had plans to develop the resources in Terras Forest on a large scale.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, as long as you defeat Steve’s Black Armor Guards, it would be best if you immediately claim to be the leader of Wissen Town. When that time comes, the Alliance will be the first to recognize and support you. I expect the Rossi Empire would give such an announcement soon after. This way, even if the Banto Empire is furious over their defeat, they would not dare to launch a large scale invasion of Wissen Town. It would be even safer if we could obtain the conferment and support of the Church.”</p> <p>Harribell did not wish for Wissen Town to land in the hands of the Banto Empire for work and personal reasons. But the Alliance couldn’t directly occupy Wissen Town, since that would also break the delicate balance they had with the other empires.</p> <p>At this time, supporting a faction from within Wissen Town itself was the best choice. Supporting Yang Ling to become the leader of Wissen Town would not only foil the plans of the Banto Empire, it would also provide the Alliance with the rich resources in Terras Forest. Two birds with one stone.</p> <p>She had discussed many details with the Alliance’s messenger before she left for Wissen Town, and because of that, she was able to obtain many premium catapults from the military. As long as she successfully completed the mission, the position of the Boulade Merchant’s Association in the Alliance would become even more solidified. It would be even better if she came to an agreement with Yang Ling on monopolizing trade on the resources of the Terras Forest.</p> <p>Spreading open a military map, Harribell gave Yang Ling a detailed analysis of the terrain of Wissen Town. She spoke in detail about Banto Empire’s possible reactions, as well as their various contingency plans, much to the agreement of the listening crowd.</p> <p>She pointed to the map. “Look here Yang Ling, this is the pass of Aila Mountain. The road is rugged, easy to defend and hard to attack. After we defeat Steve’s Black Armor Guards, all we have to do is station a team of troops here and set the relevant defenses to block the passage of Steve’s reinforcements. This is Liep Harbor. Heading west after setting off to sea here would allow us to reach the Bavaria Plains after we pass the Cape of Good Hope. As long as we have a fleet of ships, we would be able to sell the various resources at Bavaria. The ideal of Wissen Town becoming rich and powerful would be within reach!”</p> <p>Looking at the red footnotes and arrows on the military map, Yang Ling knew that Harribell had spent much effort on this. Looking at her expression as she was concentrating, her fair, tender neck, then taking a whiff of her faint fragrance, Yang Ling could not help but recall his beautiful female superior back on Earth.</p> <p>The same intelligence and ability, the same beauty and allure…</p> <p>Should I tame a female servant that is like a city leader?</p> <p>Stealing a glance at the alluring Harribell, Yang Ling’s heart throbbed involuntarily. He instinctively had an evil thought, and the privates on his lower body stood tall. Coincidentally, it hit Harribell right at her supple thigh.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, do you see any problems if we do it this way?” Harribell blushed when she felt the change in Yang Ling’s lower body. She silently shifted to the side.</p> <p>After coming to his senses, Yang Ling felt incredibly awkward after seeing Harribell’s face blushing in embarrassment. Fortunately, Goode, Casey, and the rest were all looking at the military map intently, so no one noticed the awkwardness between Harribell and himself. Only the small lass Alice, who was focused on serving Yang Ling, seemed to have noticed something. Her face turned red. She no longer dared to look at Yang Ling’s tall flagpole.</p> <p>Following that, Yang Ling calmed himself down and discussed the overall plan with Harribell. They were going to get the Rossi forces to launch a large-scale surprise attack to exhaust Steve’s troops and morale before they officially took action.</p> <p>Over the last few days, after Steve strengthened his patrol teams, the Rossi forces had no way of executing their plans. They had been growing incredibly anxious. Yang Ling believed that he wouldn’t only be able to extort a huge sum of money from them if he gave them a hundred heavy crossbows, he would also be able to shave off a great number of Steve’s forces.</p> <p>Even though there weren’t many of the Rossi soldiers, they were all elites who had a lot of battle experience. They were tough people who would fight to the death against the Banto Empire even if you only handed them a cleaver. After obtaining such powerful heavy crossbows, Yang Ling believed that they would definitely attack manically, catching Steve’s men off guard.</p> <p>Furthermore, at Harribell’s suggestion, Yang Ling would hire a large group of craftsmen and laborers under the guise of going to hunt, then secretly head to Aila Mountain to build up defensive facilities. That way, after defeating Steve’s forces, he could rapidly send his army to guard the pass at Aila Mountain, preventing the Banto reinforcements from entering Wissen Town.</p> <p>Everything was prepared. All that they needed was the opportune moment!</p> <p>After long hours of discussion, Yang Ling leaned comfortably on his large chair. With the intelligent Harribell and the experienced Goode, many of his difficult problems had been solved. He now felt much more relaxed.</p> <p>“Miss Harribell, any man who marries such an intelligent and capable beauty like you would be lucky!” Seeing Harribell’s haggard face, Yang Ling personally poured her a cup of refreshing jasmine tea as he teased her.</p> <p>Intelligent and capable beauty?</p> <p>Perhaps because no one had ever joked with her like that, the graceful Harribell’s face turned red instantly. She quickly calmed down after taking a deep breath. But despite calming down, when she looked at Yang Ling’s smile and recalled the awkward experience that had happened earlier, the blush in her face did not go away.</p> <p>A powerful woman, and such a natural beauty!</p> <p>Seeing Harribell’s blushing face, Yang Ling’s heart could not help but throb once again. A beauty like this could get things done both in work or in bed; she was definitely a woman many men dreamed of having.</p> <p>Picking up the jasmine tea, he was about to take a few mouthfuls to cool himself down when unexpectedly, the faint sound of breathing could suddenly be heard from outside the window.</p> <p>Could an assassin have infiltrated the castle?</p> <p>Despite his surprise, Yang Ling’s expression did not change. He slipped a Wizard Amulet out of his pocket and walked toward the window, pretending that nothing was happening. He then let out a sudden shout, jumping out of the window, fast as lightning. “Who’s there? Show yourself!”</p> <p>The dark figure hiding under the roof retreated quickly. At the same time, the air around the dark figure rippled as circles of strange waves appeared. Wherever the waves passed, the snow on the tree branches moved without the wind and fell to the ground.</p> <p>Yang Ling took the brunt of the waves, and his chest instantly felt as though it had been hit by a hammer. In his surprise, he was too late; he didn’t catch the intruder, even though he had thrown out the Palm Lightning Wizard Amulet without hesitation and even summoned a few Horned Bee Beasts to lash out at the enemy.</p> <p>Following a faint mutter, ripples once again appeared in the air. The dark figure strangely disappeared into thin air right as the poisonous stingers of the Horned Bee Beasts closed in!</p> <p>Death Ripples?</p> <p>Harribell charged out behind him, and when she saw the person in black strangely disappear into thin air, her expression turned serious. “Yang Ling, if I’m right, that was a terrifying Dark Spellcaster!”</p> <p>Death Ripples were a high level mental attack used by Dark Spellcasters. The abilities of the infiltrator must be nothing to laugh at if they were able to rapidly release a spell like that. Harribell was worried. If such an expert was by Steve’s side, they might have no choice but to make adjustments to their plan.</p> <p>Dark Spellcaster?</p> <p>Taking a whiff of the faint fragrance that the person in black had left behind, Yang Ling felt a sense of familiarity. He recalled the slender figure of the person in black and had a thought. He remembered Maryse and her unknown background.</p>",
  "Chapter 95: Benefitting from the Chaos": "<p>Under the hazy moonlight, a team of prepared soldiers walked toward the forest, about a hundred men strong. Between them were two Spellcasters dressed in white robes. Beside the spellcasters were ten archers with longbows in their hands. The outer circle was comprised of infantry in black heavy armor.</p> <p>“Barker, it’s too quiet around here. Something seems off!” As they neared the forest, a Black Armor Guard looked around uneasily. “Could it be that the Rossi forces have set up an ambush here?”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, they turned into cowards a long time ago. They wouldn’t dare come out now; they don’t have the gall!” The soldier called Barker did not seem concerned. He looked fiercely at his partner. “Joseph, you usually aren’t this paranoid. Could it be that you gave all your strength and courage to those ladies last night?”</p> <p>“Hehe, those ladies felt good indeed. Their boobs were larger than rice bowls!”</p> <p>“That’s right, Joseph, you sure got lucky. Being pleased seven or eight times in a single night? You’re so tired that you’re still shivering even now, haha!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>It was a relatively peaceful time as the Rossi soldiers had been unable to strike recently. Furthermore, they had the numbers advantage. The soldiers did not care much for Joseph’s worry, and they teased him mercilessly. Their conversation revolved around women and alcohol. Some said that they could down two barrels of wine in a sitting, and some said that they could torture a lady a dozen times over the night. Their stories got more and more ridiculous.</p> <p>As they laughed, the soldiers walked into the forest, completely unaware of the fist-sized Horned Bee Beasts within the bushes and treetops. No one noticed the strange, fresh mud on the ground.</p> <p>This small forest was situated between the army barracks and town center, still a great distance away from Terras Forest. The patrol team came here frequently, and the Rossi forces had never dared infiltrate this area.</p> <p>Other than the suspicious Joseph, none of the other troops thought that there would be any danger. Even the leader of the patrol team was no exception; his brain was filled with the fair ladies. Over this period of time, most ladies with notable assets had hidden within Yang Ling’s castle. Fortunately, there were still a few ladies selling their bodies; otherwise, the soldiers would have been deprived.</p> <p>“Hey, something really is strange about this forest. It’s too quiet!”</p> <p>A Spellcaster looked around the small, dark grove of trees. Even though it was winter, there should still be some birds or insects coming out to search for food. But at that moment, other than the wind, there were no cries of any birds or insects. It was too strange.</p> <p>Unlike Joseph, who was usually slacking off, the Spellcaster was respected and his words naturally carried some weight. The leader of the patrol team did not dare hesitate; he immediately ordered the soldiers to get into formation where they stood as he ignited the torch he carried with him.</p> <p>The Black Armor Guards were well-trained. They immediately formed a circular defensive formation, tightly surrounding the Spellcasters and archers. The two cautious Spellcasters joined hands and unleashed a brown protective barrier, guarding the group against any surprise attacks from their enemies.</p> <p>The soldiers reacted quickly, but unfortunately, it was still too late!</p> <p>With a roar, Evil Eyes came out from behind the trees. The group had not had the time to react when they saw a blinding light in front of them. In that instant, their eyes were overcome with pain, as if they had been blasted with scorching hot sand.</p> <p>“Ah, my eyes!”</p> <p>“Save me…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Caught off guard, the outer ring of soldiers fell onto the ground rubbing their eyes. Even the leader of the patrol team was unable to reverse the situation with his loud shouts. Everyone tried to protect himself, and the formation fell into chaos!</p> <p>Under the command of the Evil Eye Tyrant, the Evil Eyes shot out a continuous barrage of light bullets like rockets, destroying the protective spell cast by the Spellcasters in an instant. At such close range, the black heavy armor that the soldiers were so proud of was unable to withstand a hit. They became like a bunch of embarrassed ladies in the blink of an eye, helplessly exposed in front of a group of lechers.</p> <p>Seeing the disastrous situation, the soldiers who were lucky enough to survive fled in all directions. But they soon realized that it did not matter how fast they ran.</p> <p>Amidst the bushes, in the treetops, under the fallen leaves… Fist-sized Horned Bee Beasts suddenly emerged. They flew toward the soldiers, baring their sharp fangs and shooting out poisonous stingers.</p> <p>Caught off guard, several flustered soldiers became poisoned and slumped helplessly onto the ground. They looked on helplessly as the horde of Horned Bee Beasts approached them. Their foreheads, faces, and backs of their skulls all became priority targets. The munching sounds were continuous.</p> <p>In the blink of an eye, limbs were torn off and heads were chewed in half. Some soldiers were even reduced to a pool of fresh blood as the Horned Bee Beasts swarmed forward. Looking at the bloody scene, the soldiers who were lucky enough to survive felt their legs buckle. They could not even stabilize themselves, much less launch a counterattack.</p> <p>The air was filled with low-flying Horned Bee Beasts, and the ground was covered with Red-haired Tarantulas that had dug their way out of the earth. They shot out droplets of lethal poison, swarming forward like the tide.</p> <p>The small forest had been surrounded by a group of Magical Beasts. The soldiers soon realized that there was no way for them to escape!</p> <p>Seeing that they had lost any advantage, the two Spellcasters and the leader of the patrol team did not dare battle any longer. They fled under the cover of a few soldiers in an attempt to break through the embattlement.</p> <p>But just as they were about to charge out of the forest and thought that they were able to escape the crisis, a few bolts of purple lightning descended from the sky, instantly burning them to a crisp. They died on the spot.</p> <p>A perfect surprise attack!</p> <p>Under the combined attacks of the Evil Eyes, the Horned Bee Beasts, and the spider army, the small patrol team crumbled!</p> <p>Soon, the one-sided massacre ended. The air was filled with the thick metallic stench of blood.</p> <p>A few barbarians dragged the corpses of the soldiers to deep pits that they had dug previously, piling stones onto the ground after filling the pits with dirt. They then transplanted a few low lying bushes and some of the maize that could be found anywhere. Finally, Yang Ling cast a psychic spell, causing the bushes and maize to grow quickly. The disguise was perfect.</p> <p>While he was investigating the secrets of the Elven Sapling a few days ago, Yang Ling had accidentally discovered that he could greatly boost the growth of the Elven Sapling if he cast a psychic spell and injected the life force from his body into its stem.</p> <p>In just a few days, the Elven Sapling had grown from the height of a person to about five meters tall. After repeated tries, Yang Ling found out that the green life force had the same miraculous effect on other plants.</p> <p>Goode walked out after he saw Yang Ling recall the Horned Bee Beasts, Evil Eyes, and spiders. He muttered something, and wind and rain suddenly swept down, dispelling the metallic stench in the air and washing away the traces of blood on the ground.</p> <p>“Hehe, let’s go find the next batch of unlucky victims!”</p> <p>After confirming that the traces had been erased, Yang Ling let out a cold smile and led the group away quickly.</p> <p>Another group Black Armor Guards had heard the action, but by the time they arrived at the scene, they were unable to find any clues except for the traces of water. A full patrol team, a hundred men strong, had vanished into thin air.</p> <p>Yang Ling’s surprise attacks were unpredictable and didn’t leave behind any evidence. At the same time, the attacks of the Rossi forces became unusually fierce, causing the patrolling Black Armor Guards to fear for their lives.</p> <p>Renaya was elated after witnessing the power of the heavy crossbows, and he immediately accepted Yang Ling’s request for a hundred and fifty thousand Purple Crystal Coins. If they could severely damage Steve’s Black Armor Guards and foil the Banto Empire’s plans, they would have been willing to spend ten times that much.</p> <p>With the mighty crossbows being wielded by the Rossi warriors who weren’t afraid of death, Steve’s patrol team soon suffered heavy casualties. He lost nearly seven hundred people in a mere three days, and coupled with the injured warriors, Steve only had about two thousand able-bodied soldiers left. The Rossi forces only had about a hundred casualties, which was exceptional when compared to the heavy casualties of the Black Armor Guards.</p> <p>At a close range of about twenty meters, the black heavy armor of the Banto soldiers was ineffective, unable to defend against the heavy crossbows that seemed to have been summoned by the god of death. With no choice left, Steve could only retract his forces again.</p> <p>Aside from his trips to flirt with Maryse at Shangri-La, he locked himself up within the army barracks. The soldiers no longer brazenly dared to collect taxes from the townspeople. They were afraid that they would fall into Rossi ambushes if they were not careful.</p> <p>Harribell suggested that in order to obtain the greatest benefit, Yang Ling should also launch attacks on the Rossi forces and make it look like the work of the Banto Empire. He took her advice.</p> <p>No matter how carefully the Rossi soldiers hid themselves, they were unable to escape from the Horned Bee Beasts and their sharp senses. The Rossi soldiers were caught off guard by his Magical Beast army, and they didn’t have any chance to retaliate. Of the hundred or so Rossi soldiers that were killed, a large portion of them had died by Yang Ling’s hands.</p> <p>After a few of his teams had been exterminated, Renaya wrongly believed that a group of experts had come to reinforce the Banto soldiers. He no longer dared to attack recklessly. With the weather getting colder and colder, and the Banto reinforcements getting closer and closer, the situation was growing more and more tense. Renaya placed his hopes on Yang Ling. He would send someone to urge Yang Ling to personally lead his men to defeat Steve’s army daily, promising generous rewards.</p> <p>At the same time, Steve’s reinforcements still hadn’t arrived, and he was now facing a new flood of devastating surprise attacks. Steve was in terrible shape. Without sufficient rations, winter clothing to ward off the cold, or enough priests and medical supplies… Without any other choice, he had to seek Yang Ling’s help time and time again.</p> <p>Just like that, with Harribell’s advice, Yang Ling began to profit from both sides. He not only attacked Steve’s forces, he also greatly exhausted the abilities of the Rossi soldiers, creating a solid foundation for his sole control over Wissen Town. Of course, he also earned a large number of crystal coins as the price of rations and medical supplies increased by several multiples, some items rising to ten times their original price.</p> <p>Everything had been prepared, and all that was left was to wait for the opportune moment!</p> <p>The Banto and Rossi armies were fraught with worry, while Yang Ling saw images of his victory. When the time was right, he could personally lead his army in an attack, seizing complete control of Wissen Town.</p>",
  "Chapter 96: Rotting Corpses": "<p>Maryse had been developing a preliminary plan ever since she heard about Yang Ling’s intentions that night at Wissen Castle.</p> <p>Just as her teacher had said, she needed to dispel Yang Ling’s feeling of caution and misunderstanding of her identity if she wanted to complete her mission. Only by getting him to understand who she was could she show her true abilities and worth. Only then could she successfully drag him into the Association of Dark Magic; only then would she have the chance to obtain his trust, moving one step closer to destroying his psychological line of defense and charming him till he was head over heels for her.</p> <p>Even though she could teach Yang Ling a harsh lesson using her powerful Dark Magic, turning him into a skeleton wouldn’t be enough to dispel the desire for vengeance in her heart. Mercilessly abandoning him after charming him and seeing his look of intense pain was the only way to satisfy the hatred in her heart.</p> <p>Maryse believed that as long as she planned it carefully, Yang Ling would one day grovel before her.</p> <p>Of course, completing the mission had to take precedence over revenge. Even though she was seething in rage, she still knew what was most important. The levels within the association were strict, and she could not act on her own whims even if she was the proud disciple of her teacher.</p> <p>She needed a stepping stone to showcase her abilities and worth, a stepping stone that could attract the attention of everyone in the town. Without much thought, Maryse had set her sights on the unlucky Steve. She had quickly mobilized elite Dark Knights and Dark Spellcasters.</p> <p>Maryse carried out her plan meticulously, while Steve, who had fallen in love with her at first sight, was kept in the dark. He was still trying his best to please her every day, completely unaware that he was being sacrificed so that Maryse could get closer to Yang Ling. He had no idea that a tempest was about to come crashing down on him.</p> <p>On this day, after waking up early in the morning, Steve casually washed his face and headed to Shangri-La under the protection of his guards. Yesterday, after he had given his ninety-ninth rose, Maryse had finally agreed to meet with him at the outskirts.</p> <p>Steve believed that with a little more effort, Maryse would become his woman, a suffocatingly beautiful woman.</p> <p>Later, after I send my men away, I might even be able to get intimate with her in the wilderness!</p> <p>Steve swallowed hard as he thought about Maryse’s slender waist and toned thighs, his imagination running wild. Yesterday, Maryse had hinted that she did not like going out with a large number of people. He immediately stated that he would only bring a dozen guards to prevent spoiling the romantic atmosphere.</p> <p>Even though the attacks of the Rossi forces had been frequent of late, Steve did not think that he would be so unlucky as to wander into a random ambush. Furthermore, the guards following him were all warriors at the rank of Great Swordsman, and the guards wearing capes had even reached the rank of low level Sword Saint. Even if he were to encounter the Rossi forces, he was confident that he could retreat safely. As added insurance, the place he selected was not far away from the barracks; his army could arrive quickly if there were any accidents.</p> <p>After successfully fetching the beauty, Steve excitedly took her to a scenic spot by a small forest. He draped a red carpet on the ground and invited Maryse to sit.</p> <p>If he knew that this small forest was the location where Yang Ling had first ambushed the Black Armor Guards, and if he knew that the small hill nearby was holding the corpses of more than a hundred of his soldiers, he might not have been able to break a smile.</p> <p>“Beautiful Miss Maryse, come, cheers!”</p> <p>Steve was intoxicated even without the alcohol. He was growing more and more excited as he looked at Maryse in her black cloak and low cut dress. He became dizzy after just a few drinks, and he completely missed the faint, icy smile on Maryse’s face.</p> <p>Silently releasing a magic communication spell, Maryse let out an alluring smile. “Sir Leader, congratulations on obtaining such a large piece of land at such a young age. Come, cheers!”</p> <p>Looking at Maryse’s faintly visible cleavage, staring at her fair skin, taking a whiff of her subtle fragrance, Steve was overcome with the flames of lust. He had wanted to cool himself off by drinking a few mouthfuls of the cooling rum, but he found it harder to control himself the more he drank. He had no one in his eyes other than the alluring Maryse. He was oblivious to the fact that the fragrance in the air was getting thicker.</p> <p>“There’s an assassin! Protect the young master, quick!”</p> <p>Just as Steve was basking in his imagination, a warrior guard wearing a cape suddenly charged over like the wind. He blocked a dark, gleaming dart, which had clearly been coated with a lethal poison.</p> <p>Steve’s personal guards reacted quickly to the shouted warning, but it was too late. A few knights dressed completely in black charged forward, killing with one blow. They killed many of the soldiers who were caught off guard in the blink of an eye. The soldiers’ heavy black suits of armor were pierced through as if they were paper by the sharp, pitch-black spears.</p> <p>If the pitch-black knights killing the soldiers was a chilling sight; then what unfolded next could only be described as soul-shattering.</p> <p>With a wave of low murmurs, terrifying corpses started to dig out from under the mound of soil. Some of them were missing legs or arms, and some were only left with half of their heads. They walked unsteadily toward the group.</p> <p>“Young master, retreat, retreat quickly!”</p> <p>The surviving personal guards surrounded Steve and Maryse, then looked at the bloodthirsty black knights and terrifying rotting corpses. The warrior guards were also pale in shock despite their experience in battle.</p> <p>The group quickly retreated toward the barracks, and at the same time, one of the warriors blew a low sounding signal to request backup. But the black knights launched a fierce offensive before their reinforcements could arrive. Even worse, they had only paused for a moment before the rotting corpses surrounded them.</p> <p>“Get into formation, protect the young master!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, fight it out with them!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing that they could not charge out of the fight, the guards could only go all out. They hoped they could last until the reinforcements arrived. The attacks of the black knights were powerful, but with the powerful defense of Steve’s Sword Saint guard, they were unable to land a blow on Steve. His many guards surrounded him closely.</p> <p>In order to live on and to display his bravery and abilities in front of the beauty, Steve clenched his teeth and entered the battle, standing in front of Maryse.</p> <p>In the chaotic battle, no one noticed that the undead army was following Maryse’s murmurs as it swarmed toward Steve.</p> <p>While the guards were powerful, they were unable to hold up against the undead army swarming up like the tide. Coupled with the fierce attacks of the Dark Knights, the guards were soon covered in injuries. Steve was no exception; after being the focus of attacks, he was quickly covered in blood. If not for the Sword Saint and the other guards defending him with their lives, he might have already been torn to shreds by the undead army.</p> <p>With the increasing number of rotting corpses and skeletons, a few sinister looking Dark Spellcasters appeared around them. Under their command, the undead army launched a strong offensive, manically attacking Steve’s guards in waves.</p> <p>The situation was getting worse for Steve.</p> <p>The guards were fighting too hard to notice the odd behavior of the undead. The corpses were continuously attacking Steve, but they didn’t seem to notice Maryse beside him. When they could not avoid it, the rotting corpses and skeletons would either charge toward the Sword Saint who cut them down like some god of war, or they would run into Maryse’s long sword as if they were committing suicide.</p>",
  "Chapter 97: Fog-like Woman": "<p>Soon after, with the coordinated shouts of the few Dark Spellcasters, a circle of strange fog appeared around the zombies and skeletons. If the guards accidentally came into contact with the fog, their skin would begin to rot rapidly, and not even their bones were spared. As a few of the guards fell to the attack, the terrifying undead army tightened the circle around Steve and the group.</p> <p>Deathly Poisonous Fog?</p> <p>Seeing the black fog around the zombies and skeletons, Steve’s Sword Saint guard swallowed hard. The Deathly Poisonous Fog was a high level magic spell of the dark element. It was clear that the Dark Spellcasters around them were all Great Spellcasters. Coupled with the handful of high level Dark Knights, the situation was far from good.</p> <p>“Young master, I’ll carry you out, quick!” After a moment’s deliberation, the cloaked Sword Saint knew that they had to escape. He squatted down in front of Steve, clenching his teeth.</p> <p>My guards can’t break through this enemy?</p> <p>Steve looked at the zombies and skeletons swarming toward them, then at Maryse who was standing behind him, her face pale from shock. Steve hesitated. He was worried that he would be trapped here by the rotting corpses and skeletons, but he didn’t want to abandon the beautiful Maryse.</p> <p>“Sir, what are we going to do, what are we going to do?”</p> <p>Maryse pretended to be distraught, and she spoke frantically as she leaned against Steve. Her supple skin and alluring fragrance, coupled with the deep-rooted enticement of her Temptation of Darkness, quickly mesmerized the man. Steve only came to his senses after his Sword Saint came to his side, blocking a sneak attack by a Dark Knight.</p> <p>“Barty, carry Miss Maryse and open a path. I’ll lead the guards and cover your back, quick!”</p> <p>Even though he was fearful and sweating due to his nerves, Steve realized he couldn’t bear to abandon the beautiful Maryse. Ever since he first saw Maryse, he had fallen irretrievably in love with this beauty in black.</p> <p>Time was of the essence. As Steve’s insistence, the Sword Saint let out a sigh and picked up Maryse, then charged forward with large strides. The zombies and skeletons blocking the way were all reduced to pieces wherever his three-inch-thick red Battle Energy passed. Even the bloodthirsty Dark Knights had to take a few steps back in retreat.</p> <p>When he was using his full strength, the beginner level Sword Saint had no equal on that battlefield. But he failed to notice the cold gleam in Maryse’s eyes or the thin black needle slowly making its way toward the large artery in his neck. He was completely oblivious to the impending danger.</p> <p>If Barty had looked over his shoulder, he would have noticed that Maryse was moving her mouth behind his back, silently reciting an incantation. He might have even seen the strange Magical Energy gathering behind him.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it mattered little what might have been!</p> <p>With Barty leading the charge, Steve and his group successfully broke through the outermost ring of the enemy. But just as Steve thought that he was going to put the danger behind him, he saw the Sword Saint Barty shudder. The warrior fell to the ground in disbelief after letting out a pathetic wail.</p> <p>Barty is dead?</p> <p>Despite being a Sword Saint, he met with misfortune the moment he was about to charge out of the encircling enemy forces?</p> <p>Steve and the rest were pale in shock. In their surprise, no one noticed the look of betrayal Barty gave Maryse before he died, and no one noticed the small needle wound on his neck. Even more so, no one noticed the faint, icy smile on Maryse’s face.</p> <p>Even a Sword Saint could not survive that poison!</p> <p>The poison was extracted from the body of a Silver-ringed Snake, and reinforced with a Dark Infiltration Magic that was specially formulated to pierce through protective Battle Energy. The warrior guard Barty had fallen for Maryse’s sinister plot in his carelessness.</p> <p>On an average day, Barty’s strength as a Sword Saint would have allowed him to forcefully repel the poison using his Battle Energy. But while he was using all his strength to deal with the undead army, how could he have thought that the woman he was protecting would suddenly strike him down?</p> <p>In his carelessness, Barty’s protective Battle Energy had been dispelled by Maryse’s Dark Infiltration Magic. Following that, the fatal snake poison entered his body. By the time he noticed something was wrong, it was already too late!</p> <p>After quickly withdrawing the thin poisonous needle, Maryse put on an act and shrieked, hiding right behind Steve. But just as she clenched her teeth and was preparing to use the same strategy, she suddenly saw two figures riding tall horses towards them.</p> <p>One was wearing Kevlar Heavy Armor and wielding a Darkmetal Longspear, and the other had flowing white robes and wielded a dark green staff. They were the Knight of the Divine Palace Clause and Spellcaster Michelle, who were passing through the area.</p> <p>Envoys of the Church?</p> <p>Looking at the approaching Knight of the Divine Palace and the white-robed Spellcaster, then looking at the dumbfounded Steve, Maryse clenched her teeth in frustration. In order to preserve her strength, in order to avoid alarming these envoys of the Church, she could only issue the order to retreat.</p> <p>There were only two of them. Even though she could easily finish them off, she was unwilling to act rashly. The Church would definitely not let things rest if she killed Clause and Michelle now. If she attracted the attention of a large group of Spellcasters and Knights of the Divine Palace, and in so doing influenced her teacher’s plans, then the gains would not outweigh the losses.</p> <p>But even though she was unable to seize the opportunity to get rid of Steve, killing his Sword Saint guard was enough. It would cause a commotion all around Wissen Town.</p> <p>Maryse believed that after understanding the abilities of the Association of Dark Magic, Yang Ling would not ignore such a powerful potential ally. As long as she was successful in dispelling Yang Ling’s caution and misunderstanding, then her plan would have already succeeded by half.</p> <p>After receiving the order, the Dark Knights and Dark Spellcasters quickly vanished into the forest. The zombies and skeletons who had lost their leaders were all purified quickly by Michelle’s Holy Purification as she charged forward.</p> <p>There were counters to everything. Dealing with the puppet-like rotting corpses and skeletons had been a headache for Steve and his guards, but to a powerful Spellcaster of the Church like Michelle, low level dark life forms could not survive a hit. They posed no threat no matter how many of them there were.</p> <p>After being saved by Clause and Michelle, Steve was still distraught as he stared straight at the motionless Barty. He could never have expected the Sword Saint to meet with such a misfortune. He did not even know how Barty had been attacked.</p> <p>Steve grimly thought of the Rossi soldiers. I’ll exterminate all of you!</p> <p>The patrol team had suffered heavy casualties. Even the Sword Saint guard had met with misfortune. Steve clenched his fists, realizing that a group of elite reinforcements had arrived to aid the Rossi soldiers. Only the Rossi had such a strong conflict of interest with him, and only the Rossi could have such terrifying Dark Knights and Spellcasters.</p> <p>After quickly sending Maryse back to Shangri-La, Steve sent an urgent message to request for an increase in the number and speed of his reinforcements. The Rossi reinforcements had already arrived, and if his own reinforcements didn’t arrive for another two weeks, they would only be able to collect his corpse.</p> <p>A stone could create a thousand layers of waves!</p> <p>Quickly, news of the attack spread all over Wissen Town. Some were happy and celebrating, but others locked themselves at home, afraid that they would meet with misfortune if they ventured out.</p> <p>After leaving the battlefield, Michelle and Clause had serious expressions. They quickly sent out word of Dark Spellcasters appearing in Wissen Town, and they requested backup from the Church. At the same time, in another villa in Shangri-La, Maryse was discussing the next step of the plan with a few Dark Knights and Spellcasters.</p> <p>After receiving the news, the Rossi forces hiding in Terras Forest became excited, cheering without end. Even Renaya, who did not typically show emotion, was no exception. He knew that Yang Ling had finally begun to take action.</p> <p>In his mind, only Yang Ling and Steve had a true conflict of interest in Wissen Town. And only Yang Ling had the ability to plan such a shocking attack.</p> <p>“Lord, now that Yang Ling has already taken action, we should give him an even bigger reason to go all out, mobilizing his troops to completely destroy the Banto forces. Now, it is time to go visit him!” The tactician hiding in the darkness whispered his suggestion softly to the excited Renaya.</p> <p>Hearing the tactician say this, Renaya had a thought and replied, “That’s right, it’s about time we show our hand to Yang Ling. Time waits for no one; we move tomorrow morning!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The Rossi forces were celebrating, and within Wissen Castle, everyone was also very excited. The servants were discussing this great piece of news wherever they went. From the old to the young, everyone was cursing the violent ruler Steve, hoping for him to die a gory death.</p> <p>“Goode, how do you view this situation?” Yang Ling gently rubbed his temples as he leaned on the large chair.</p> <p>Yang Ling had received the news not long after Steve had met with the sneak attack. Originally, he had thought that it was the Rossi soldiers, but after receiving detailed news of Steve’s injuries and the Sword Saint’s death, he realized that this incident was not as simple as it seemed.</p> <p>If the Rossi had such powerful abilities, they would have attacked long ago. Why would they have waited until now?</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Goode said slowly, “Sir, according to the report from Parrot, there have been several men in black of unknown origin in Maryse’s villa over these past few days. They came and went day after day, and their abilities were deep beyond comprehension! When Steve fell for the surprise attack, someone noticed that the spellcasters had sneakily retreated from the battlefield. According to preliminary estimates, they are definitely related to the assassination of Steve’s men!”</p> <p>Maryse?</p> <p>Yang Ling doubtfully took a sip of his refreshing jasmine tea. Over these days of observation, he was sure that Maryse was not an assassin sent by Steve. If the information was true and Steve’s attempted assassination was her doing, then she couldn’t have been sent by the Anca family. Otherwise, she would only think of ways to help Steve deal with Yang Ling. There was no need, nor was there a possibility that she would strike his enemy!</p> <p>A fog-like woman. Just who is she, and what kind of unspeakable motive does she have?</p> <p>Unable to figure it out, Yang Ling instructed Goode to monitor Maryse’s actions tightly and do everything he could to find out about her background in the shortest amount of time.</p>",
  "Chapter 98: Rope In": "<p>People were bustling in and out of Wissen Castle early in the morning. There were guards patrolling near the castle, servants cleaning the castle, and even a few warriors heading out to hunt in Terras Forest in groups. No one noticed that a few tall foreigners had secretly made their way into the castle following Argus, Yang Ling’s personal guard.</p> <p>“Sir, this way please!” After leading Renaya and his group into the meeting hall, Argus shot a look to Jarlock, the leader of the barbarians. Jarlock understood the signal and immediately led a team of fierce barbarians to guard the door.</p> <p>“Welcome to Wissen Castle, please sit!” Yang Ling was all smiles, and he signaled for a maid beside him to serve tea.</p> <p>As Yang Ling observed the tall Renaya, his composed footsteps and sharp gaze, then looked at the followers walking respectfully behind him, Yang Ling knew that Renaya was a man who had been sitting in the upper echelons of society for many years. He thought about Renaya’s status and background back in the Rossi Empire.</p> <p>“I am the envoy of the Rossi Empire, and I am completely in charge of this operation. Sir Yang, you may call me Renaya!” Renaya graciously sat on the opposite side of Yang Ling.</p> <p>Renaya didn’t relax his guard, even though Yang Ling was in casual wear, lazily leaning on his large chair. Yang Ling was not as high-spirited and energetic as Renaya had imagined him to be.</p> <p>But one should not judge a book by its cover. A person who had nearly a thousand warriors, a mysterious background, a seemingly endless supply of money, and a Magical Beast army was definitely not an ordinary noble.</p> <p>Negotiations were like playing a poker game; one should not reveal all of their abilities too quickly!</p> <p>Renaya had introduced himself in an ambiguous manner, saying that he was an envoy from the Rossi Empire. He didn’t reveal his status as a prince. It would be enough for him to reveal that he was authorized to handle everything on this operation and negotiate on behalf of the empire.</p> <p>Renaya was calm and intelligent, but unfortunately, there were calculations that were beyond his control!</p> <p>“So Prince Renaya, you are in charge of this operation. It is no wonder that you have been able to cause so much trouble for the Banto soldiers with just a few hundred men. You are quite powerful!” said Harribell’s voice.</p> <p>Yang Ling and Goode had never heard of anyone called Renaya, but Harribell conducted business all over the Tailun Continent, so she was familiar with most of the royalty in the various empires. Even though she had never seen Renaya in person, the reputation of the Twelfth Prince of the Rossi Empire had long entered her family’s list of notable people.</p> <p>Prince?</p> <p>Yang Ling was very surprised. Originally, he had thought that Renaya was merely an important official or a trusted aide of the king in the Rossi Empire. He had never expected that the man would be a prince.</p> <p>If they were sending a prince to attend to the matter personally, it was clear how important foiling the Banto Empire’s plan was to the Rossi Empire.</p> <p>After getting over his surprise, Yang Ling’s smile became even more radiant. The more importance that the Rossi Empire placed on this operation, the more advantageous it was to him. As long as he spent a little effort, Yang Ling believed that he would be able to obtain an even greater profit.</p> <p>At the same time, Renaya was also very surprised when he saw the veiled Harribell. He had never expected someone to have heard of him in this far away, desolate town.</p> <p>There were many talents here indeed!</p> <p>The lad Yang Ling was definitely born into a noble family; otherwise, there was no way that he could have gained this many outstanding followers!</p> <p>Even with his eyes closed, Renaya could feel that there were at least three Great Swordsmen and two Great Spellcasters with exceptional abilities around Yang Ling. Other than that, there were faint waves of Magical Energy coming from behind the screen in the hall. There were probably several powerful fighters lying in ambush there.</p> <p>Even though he could not sense any traces of Magical Energy or Battle Energy from Yang Ling, Renaya did not dare underestimate the seemingly lazy young man.</p> <p>After all, a Summoner who could summon a large number of Magical Beasts to defeat the Nine-headed Snake Monster was definitely not an average person. Renaya’s inability to sense any ripples of Magical Energy from within Yang Ling suggested that he had already reached a level where he could mask his abilities at will.</p> <p>An enemy that you couldn’t understand was the most terrifying!</p> <p>Looking at the imperceptible Yang Ling and experiencing his massive abilities, Renaya felt lucky that he wasn’t the young man’s opponent. Otherwise, Renaya might have difficulty leaving Wissen Town alive, much less foiling the tactics of the Banto Empire.</p> <p>After a series of formalities, Yang Ling smiled and shot a look at the old butler behind him. The old man understood and instructed the servants to serve wine and food.</p> <p>Golden brown roasted lamb oozing with fat, fragrant teriyaki beef, and casks of precious hundred-year-old Raphael Red Wine… Even though it was incomparable to the opulent banquets in the Rossi Empire, the food was enough for Renaya and his group to enjoy.</p> <p>Over the many days they had been hiding in the Terras Forest, they had been gnawing on hard rations as they did not dare make a fire to cook. They had gotten sick of the food long ago. Now that they were being served such fragrant dishes, they barely even stopped to chew.</p> <p>After they finished their meal, the old butler instructed the servants to serve plates of Wissen Town specialties such as Alpen Cashews and peanuts that had been kept in the cold since the summer. Finally, they served each person a cup of premium jasmine tea, much to the awe of Renaya, who was deeply knowledgeable.</p> <p>He truly is a noble!</p> <p>In the harsh winter, when an ordinary person might not even have enough to eat, Yang Ling was able to incorporate such luxuries into a mere meal.</p> <p>After taking away the dishes, Yang Ling smiled and started talking. He slowly talked about everything from how big Terras Forest was to the life habits of Twin-horned Deer. He avoided talking about the matter at hand.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, may I know when you will be willing to mobilize your troops?” After listening to Yang Ling’s nonsense for a while, Renaya finally couldn’t hold it in any longer.</p> <p>“Oh, that can’t be rushed!” Yang Ling pretended to deliberate for a moment. “Steve doesn’t have enough coats to ward off the cold, nor does he have a way to replenish the rations and weapons he has exhausted. This winter is going badly for him. Even if he is able to get through the winter, I would think that his troops will be weak by then. We’ll certainly be able to mobilize our troops then!”</p> <p>He’s going to wait until next year?</p> <p>In his surprise, Renaya almost choked on the tea in his mouth. According to reliable information, Steve’s reinforcements were already quickly making their way toward Wissen Town. Time was tight, and the situation was getting worse. If they waited until spring to engage in battle, they would not have any chance of victory against ten thousand fully prepared Black Armor Guards.</p> <p>Hmph, a crafty young fox!</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, Renaya forcefully calmed himself down from the urge of slamming the table. He did not have to think too much to know that Yang Ling was only trying to fish for more profit. On the negotiation table, being rash was a taboo. It would be easier to pay a foolish price if he was rash.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, Wissen Town is rich in resources. It would be too much of a pity if it landed in the hands of the Banto Empire.” Renaya pretended to pause and look at Yang Ling, who seemed to be thinking about something. “While we have been here, you have supplied us with much help. As a reward, the Rossi Empire would confer upon you the title of Leader of Wissen after we successfully defeat the arrogant Banto people. You would control a piece of land with the radius of a few thousand miles. We would also support you in terms of military and finance!”</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Renaya had decided to go straight to the point. He might not be able to achieve his aim in time if he continued to discuss things with a sly fox like Yang Ling.</p> <p>He’s offering to name me the Leader of Wissen?</p> <p>Yang Ling gave a calm smile after understanding Renaya’s bargaining chips. The Rossi people were intelligent indeed. This would not only foil the plans of the Banto Empire, they would also obtain a piece of land situated behind their mortal enemies, putting Yang Ling in a deadlock with the Banto Empire. But he wouldn’t be foolish enough to slip into that trap, not even if he was thinking with his butt.</p>",
  "Chapter 99: Fat Lamb to the Slaughter": "<p>“Sir Yang, if you become a town leader under our empire, the empire can give you a large amount of support in terms of finance and military. You can purchase the Rossi Empire’s Gaul Warhorses that are famous all over the world at an extremely low price, and you can build a private army of up to three thousand people. In fact, if there is a need, the empire could even send an army to defend your territory. You wouldn’t need to worry about a Banto attack!”</p> <p>After tossing out his lure, Renaya took a gentle sip of the refreshing jasmine tea. Terras Forest was rich with resources and Wissen Town had unique conditions. He believed that Yang Ling wouldn’t pass up this rare opportunity. After all, if Steve established a solid control over Wissen Town, it would severely limit Yang Ling’s development. The dwarf weapon shop and Shangri-La would also be wasted efforts.</p> <p>Renaya was confident, but he soon realized that he had made a mistake. Yang Ling was completely uninterested in Renaya’s offer!</p> <p>My private army would have to be smaller than three thousand people?</p> <p>Yang Ling let out a cold smile. He would truly be an incurable idiot if he fell for Renaya’s trap while he had such an advantageous position. Renaya was right. He had to establish firm control over Wissen Town and chase away the forces of the Banto Empire. But that did not mean that he had to bend his knees and become the Rossi Empire’s puppet.</p> <p>“Prince, to tell you the truth, I’m merely a merchant. I do not have much of an interest in being a town leader!” Yang Ling retreated as a means of advancement. He calmly said, “I am accustomed to freedom. I might live in Wissen Town today, but I might decide to roam the Livenza Alliance someday. Being free like that is comfortable!”</p> <p>Renaya was very surprised. He had thought that Yang Ling would try to negotiate for more benefits, like expanding the scale of the army to ten thousand men or requesting that the empire supply him a large number of warhorses for free. But he had never expected Yang Ling to directly say that he wasn’t interested in being a local ruler.</p> <p>Just what family does Yang Ling belong to?</p> <p>As Renaya watched Yang Ling lazily reclining in his large chair, Renaya could not understand what the young man was thinking. He wasn’t sure if this was simply a negotiating tactic, or if Yang Ling was truly uninterested in being the Leader of Wissen. After all, a noble from a rich family would definitely control a sizeable area of land. It was possible that Yang Ling truly wasn’t interested in the faraway Wissen Town.</p> <p>Harribell was observing from the side, and she quickly understood Renaya’s plans and Yang Ling’s intentions. After deliberating for a moment, she came up with a smart idea. “Prince, I propose that we do business. As long as you are willing to pay an adequate price, we would help you foil the battle strategies of the Banto Empire. We would all get what we want. How’s that?”</p> <p>“Interesting. What requests do you have? Feel free to voice them!” Renaya quickly calmed himself down after the surprise.</p> <p>Any price was negotiable. He wasn’t afraid of their request; he was only worried that they would have no interest in dealing with Steve. If that was the case, there was no way that he could succeed in foiling the Banto Empire’s plans with his abilities alone.</p> <p>“Simple. Twenty thousand Gaul Warhorses, three crystal mines near the borders of Livenza, and a million Purple Crystal Coins. We’ll deploy our troops right away!”</p> <p>Harribell had come prepared. The Boulade Merchant’s Association under her control had long set their sights on the three premium crystal mines under Rossi control near the borders of the Livenza Alliance. Unfortunately, the large merchant associations in the Rossi Empire had also set their sights on them, so the competition was intense. How could she miss this opportunity today, now that she had encountered Prince Renaya?</p> <p>Crystal mines?</p> <p>Renaya was shocked, looking at the veiled Harribell. The three premium crystal mines near the borders of Livenza had only recently been discovered, and even he had just received the news. He did not expect Yang Ling to have made preparations so quickly.</p> <p>He sure lives up to his reputation as a noble from a rich family. His sources of information are impressive, and he has many exceptional followers, Renaya thought.</p> <p>After exchanging opinions with the tactician behind him, Renaya clenched his teeth and said, “The warhorses and crystal coins are no problem, but I can only promise one crystal mine for the time being. I’ll try fighting for the other two mines when I return to the empire after the mission is successfully completed.”</p> <p>With his authority in the military, trading twenty thousand warhorses wouldn’t be a problem. And even though a million Purple Crystal Coins was not a small sum, he believed that the finance minister wouldn’t give him too much trouble over it. The only issue was the three premium crystal mines. He had heard that the nobles within the country had already begun fighting over them due to the number of crystals they contained. Even his father was feeling the heat from the fights. Renaya was not confident that he could obtain all three of the crystal mines.</p> <p>Even though twenty thousand warhorses, one crystal mine, and a million Purple Crystal Coins was not a small sum, Renaya was willing to pay any price to foil the plans of the Banto Empire, for the long term interests of his own nation.</p> <p>Seeing Renaya readily promise one crystal mine, Harribell was incredibly excited despite her unchanging expression. According to reliable information, the three crystal mines contained a large number of crystals. One of those crystal mines contained more crystals than a dozen ordinary crystal mines. They were also easy to harvest. Gaining control of even one crystal mine was a windfall. They would definitely turn a huge profit.</p> <p>“Thank you for your large gift, prince!” Harribell smiled then continued, “If you could continue supporting us as you have been, we will not mind gathering a large number of warriors to exhaust the energies of the Banto soldiers over a long period of time. I would think that your empire would be glad to see another independent territory opposing the Banto Empire!”</p> <p>Independent territory?</p> <p>When Harribell said this, Renaya looked at Yang Ling, who was still lazily reclining in his chair. Renaya understood that Yang Ling had finally voiced his true request. Yang Ling had played him, and he felt as though he was trying to swallow something bitter.</p> <p>A wily merchant, a wily merchant even more cunning than a fox!</p> <p>Renaya’s face turned a steel green as he looked at the smiling Yang Ling. As the Twelfth Prince of the Rossi Empire, he had bullied others ever since he was young. All his life, be it leading armies to battle or dealing with the internal politics of his kingdom, he had never once faced such a loss.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, supporting you as an independent leader is not an issue, but there would be no warhorses, crystal mines, or crystal coins in that case!” Seeing the fuming Renaya, the tactician behind him quickly stepped out and cast a secret Soul Spell to help Renaya calm down quickly.</p> <p>Goode smiled as he spoke from behind Yang Ling. “Hehe, with our abilities, we will be able to establish control over Wissen Town even without your support. Somehow I doubt that you will want the independent Wissen Town to side with the Banto Empire, selling them large amounts of various resources at a cheap price!”</p> <p>Goode’s words struck right at Renaya’s weakness!</p> <p>It didn’t matter if the Banto Empire directly controlled the resources in Terras Forest or received strategic resources indirectly through Yang Ling; it would be disadvantageous to the Rossi Empire either way.</p> <p>Renaya understood that after receiving a large amount of resources, the Banto Empire would not only avert their financial crisis, but they could also strengthen their military significantly, obtaining the upper hand in their border skirmishes with the Rossi Empire. This outcome would be unacceptable to Renaya’s father, who hoped to expand their territory.</p> <p>Also, the Rossi Empire was now conducting a large scale invasion of the Apennine Plains to the north. If they were to enter a large scale conflict with the Banto Empire in the south, they would be stuck in a battle on both sides. That could be disastrous.</p> <p>With time being tight and the worsening situation, Renaya had no choice but to accept once again. With the negotiations of his tactician, he finally got Yang Ling’s promise to mobilize his troops immediately for the price of ten thousand Gaul Warhorses, one crystal mine near the Livenza border, five hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins, and the Rossi Empire’s support of Yang Ling as an independent leader.</p>",
  "Chapter 100: Becoming Immensely Wealthy": "<p>Even though Renaya had achieved his aim of getting Yang Ling to mobilize his troops, he still felt uncomfortable when he thought about the price he had paid. He wasn’t happy that he had fallen for Yang Ling’s schemes, and he was secretly planning ways to give Yang Ling a taste of his powers after they defeated the Banto forces.</p> <p>Renaya was depressed, as if he had just swallowed a dead fly, but the people in Wissen Castle were cheering, all of them discussing their gains. According to a preliminary estimate, one Gaul Warhorse cost about a hundred Purple Crystal Coins, so ten thousand of the warhorses was equivalent to a million Purple Crystal Coins. As for the crystal mine with its incredibly reserves, no one was able to estimate its value.</p> <p>They had earned a lot!</p> <p>Everyone was smiling after understanding the value of the warhorses and crystal mines, and even the servants pouring tea were no exception. Yang Ling was a generous man, so his followers would definitely benefit now that he had come across such a fortune.</p> <p>After doing some calculations, Harribell took off her veil and said, “Yang Ling, I do not need the warhorses or the crystal coins, but I want half of the profits of the crystal mine!”</p> <p>“That’s not possible. The most I can do is a twenty-eighty split. Helping Renaya this time around is risking my life, and furthermore, I have to support so many people!” Yang Ling rejected her on the spot.</p> <p>“Forty-sixty, that is my limit!” This was too important for Harribell to back down. As someone responsible for a large merchant organization, no one understood the value of the crystal mine more clearly than she did.</p> <p>“Harribell, look at me! I’m so poor that I cannot even afford to eat. You have a large family and empire, why do you care so much about such a small amount of money!” Yang Ling said, looking incredibly sad. Seeing how tightly Renaya had held onto the mine, Yang Ling knew that it was by far the most valuable item involved in the trade. He would already obtain countless crystal coins with just ten percent of the profits, so how could he bear to back down?</p> <p>So poor that he can’t even afford meals?</p> <p>The crowd nearly fainted. An ordinary person could never maintain this massive castle or support thousands of warriors and a few hundred servants. Furthermore, Yang Ling had a rich family behind him. If he could be described as so poor that he could barely afford meals, an average noble couldn’t even be called a beggar.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, it is a pity that you aren’t a businessman!” Harribell clenched her teeth as she looked at the smiling Yang Ling. “Excavating a mine is not as simple as it might sound. It requires many experienced craftsmen, familiarity with the sales channels of crystal ore, and even a large amount of investment capital to get over the many obstacles. You wouldn’t be able to accomplish much without a wide network of business connections. Yang Ling, forty-sixty is my limit. I’m not even earning much if we add in the costs!”</p> <p>Intelligent. She sure lives up to her reputation as an experienced businesswoman. Her words are clear and organized, calm and composed!</p> <p>Looking at the seemingly sincere Harribell, the group nodded in approval of her words. Only Yang Ling thought of them as wind by his ear. No one would agree to an unprofitable business deal. Yang Ling knew that Harribell would earn a massive profit at a forty-sixty split even if he was thinking using his toes. Otherwise, she would not be arguing against him with such obvious calculation.</p> <p>Tsk tsk, she sure is a powerful woman!</p> <p>Harribell had removed her veil, and as Yang Ling looked at her supple skin and serious expression, he couldn’t help but stare. There were countless beautiful ladies in the world, but a large portion of them were like vases, only beautiful to the eye. A woman like this was precious in multiple respects.</p> <p>“So Yang Ling, what are your intentions? If you are willing, I can immediately get someone to begin the preparatory work, such as initial explorations of the mine!” Feeling Yang Ling’s strange gaze, then recalling the thing that suddenly prodded her leg the other night, Harribell’s face turned red. Yang Ling’s heart began to thump.</p> <p>Coming to his senses, Yang Ling deliberated for a moment before saying, “Alright, forty-sixty it is. But I will have to trouble you to find me two hundred craftsmen, two hundred carpenters, and a hundred alchemists!”</p> <p>In business, the best outcome was one where both parties won! In his third year of college, an economics professor had told Yang Ling a story.</p> <p>There was a businessman who set up a VCD factory, and his products occupied an eighty percent market share in the country. He even had large exports to eastern Europe and Southeast Asia. When they were drinking, the businessman revealed that he was proudest of his strict control over the cost of his materials. He claimed that if the supplier’s cost was fifteen cents, he would be able to buy it himself for fifteen cents.</p> <p>At a banquet, the professor gave that high-spirited businessman a suggestion, saying that the low profits of his suppliers would not bode well for him. It was highly possible that they were mixing in lower quality goods or delaying the delivery of the items, and that would affect the quality of his products or speed of his manufacturing.</p> <p>The wealthy businessman had immediately disregarded the words of the professor. But just half a year later, the truth had confirmed the old professor’s suggestion.</p> <p>Quality issues with the supplier’s materials forced the company to issue a large number of refunds. Coupled with the late arrival of critical resources, severely delaying the ability for the businessman to deliver goods, he soon lost a large portion of his clients. Unable to recoup his capital, the businessman was unable to pay the suppliers, which led to the lack of materials once again, creating a vicious cycle.</p> <p>After just three months, the once successful company toppled. It caused a commotion in the early nineties, attracting widespread attention.</p> <p>The Boulade Merchant’s Association controlled by Harribell had businesses all over the Tailun Continent, their connections wide. The development of Wissen Town would be tied to these large merchant associations that could do practically anything. In consideration of long term interests, Yang Ling did not mind making an appropriate compromise.</p> <p>With his many warriors and exquisite weapons, coupled with his Magical Beast army, he believed that defeating Steve and his Black Armor Guards would not be too difficult a task. The more pressing issue would be developing Wissen Town after he established firm control over the area.</p> <p>Developing Wissen Town would require a large amount of human traffic, and that meant that he would need a large number of houses that could shelter people from the elements. Thus, he would definitely need expert craftsmen. Other than that, Wissen Town had a large amount of precious woods and minerals. He would need expert carpenters and alchemists for that.</p> <p>Selling resources could only supply the people with manual labor jobs, just like the sweatshops near the coasts in Asia. Resources alone were unable to bring in true fortune and profit.</p> <p>Yang Ling hoped that he could transform the resources in Terras Forest into actual products and sell them in bulk after he had enough capital and skills. After all, a low level Magical Beast Essence Crystal might only sell for a hundred Purple Crystal Coins, but if it were placed in a staff, it might fetch more than a thousand Purple Crystal Coins, greatly boosting the profit.</p> <p>A hundred alchemists?</p> <p>Originally, Harribell had heaved a sigh of relief when Yang Ling agreed to the forty-sixty split. But she couldn’t help but shake her head and let out a bitter laugh when he followed up with the request for a hundred alchemists.</p> <p>It was rather easy to recruit two hundred craftsmen and carpenters; all she would need to do was offer appropriately enticing wages. But alchemy was a rare occupation within the continent. It would be difficult to recruit even ten alchemists in a short amount of time, much less a hundred.</p> <p>In the Tailun Continent, the nobles were interested in learning either Battle Energy or Magical Energy; no one was willing to deal with bottles and cans for the entire day like a farmer. The commoners, on the other hand, were unable to learn it even if they wanted to.</p> <p>Learning alchemy not only required a lot of money, it was also rather ineffective. One might take out a loan to begin learning, then study alchemy for a decade without achieving mastery. To a commoner, being a knight was a safer choice.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, two hundred craftsmen and carpenters are not a problem, but recruiting a hundred alchemists will be more difficult. I’ll try my best!”</p> <p>Harribell gave a simple explanation of the difficulties in recruiting alchemists, and after listening to the explanation, Yang Ling did not insist on his request. After all, if even the large Boulade Merchant’s Association was unable to do it, it would be even more impossible for someone like him.</p> <p>He was satisfied despite being unable to recruit a hundred alchemists. A million Purple Crystal Coins after selling off the Gaul Warhorses, coupled with the profits of the crystal mine, would be enough for the large scale development of Wissen Town, especially if he were to count the crystal coins he found in the Anca family treasury.</p> <p>To think that he had unintentionally become immensely wealthy!</p> <p>Thinking back to the time when he had frantically searched for a job after graduating from college, or when he had worked a nine-to-five job as an intern with no job security, Yang Ling was overcome with emotion. This foreign, yet mysterious world was filled with possibility.</p>",
  "Chapter 101: Reaping Profits from Both Sides": "<p>After some discussion, just as Yang Ling, Harribell, and the rest were about to part ways, the guard Argus walked in with large strides. “Sir, the Pig Leader Steve visits!”</p> <p>The Pig Leader?</p> <p>Harribell almost spat out the jasmine tea in her mouth in surprise. Even though she knew that Steve was unpopular in Wissen Town, she hadn’t expected his reputation to be this bad. She quickly put on her veil after her surprise. She was not willing to expose her identity in front of others until Yang Ling solidified his control over the situation.</p> <p>Could it be that Steve’s situation has become truly untenable, so he’s coming to extort me once again?</p> <p>Yang Ling considered Steve’s intentions. It must have been hard for Steve to last this long, with the weather getting colder and the surprise attacks from the Rossi. According to information from the intelligence team Parrot, Steve had been forced to increase the intensity and radius of his tax collection, but it did little to alleviate the situation. His days still felt like years.</p> <p>There is a solution to any problem!</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling instructed Argus to bring Steve in. He had previously managed to shrug off Steve’s request by promising to pay in installments. After that, he had dealt with problems as they arose. He had ways of not letting Steve take advantage of him.</p> <p>Soon, the haggard Steve followed Argus into the room. But surprisingly, as well as a few personal guards, there were also a few ordinary troops carrying crates.</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, it’s been a long time. How are your businesses doing these days?” Steve forced out a smile when he entered the hall.</p> <p>“Not good, not good at all!” Yang Ling put on an act and sighed. “I did business in the Livenza Alliance recently and suffered a huge loss. I might not even have enough rice to support my people. I was actually intending to seek your help!”</p> <p>Not enough rice to support his people?</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling lying in such a calm and composed manner, the crowd broke into a sweat. Even Harribell was no exception. The haggard Steve remained dumbfounded for a long time.</p> <p>After giving a faint smile, Yang Ling instructed the servants to serve tea. He was not in a hurry, not in a hurry at all. He spoke nonsense, from how cold the weather was to the health benefits of drinking tea. He intentionally interrupted Steve, who was trying to stop him, multiple times, making the man incredibly anxious.</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, in order to thank you for your continuous support, I have brought a few small gifts with me today!” Seizing the opportunity when Yang Ling stopped talking to take a sip of tea, Steve ordered his troops to open the crates he had brought with him.</p> <p>Looking in, Yang Ling saw that the crates were filled with black armor and weapons of various kinds. The crates were big, but they were only half-filled. It looked like Steve was at the end of his rope.</p> <p>Only a person with evil intentions gives gifts for no reason!</p> <p>Yang Ling gave a cold smile and instructed the old butler Murbaqi to accept the gifts, then returned to his tea. He feigned ignorance, not asking Steve about his intentions. This made the once-arrogant leader even more anxious.</p> <p>After waiting for some time, Steve became depressed when he saw Yang Ling only focused on drinking his tea. He clenched his teeth and had no choice but to steel his nerves and say, “Brother Yang Ling, the Rossi soldiers are violent and barbaric, and they have launched surprise attacks on the troops of the Banto Empire on multiple occasions. They even threaten ordinary citizens. For the glory of the empire, for the stability of Wissen Town, we have to think of ways to capture them all!”</p> <p>For the glory of the empire?</p> <p>Yang Ling let out a cold laugh, finally understanding the Pig Leader’s intentions. Like Renaya, Steve was hoping that Yang Ling would mobilize his troops to aid him in battle. Unfortunately, this empire was the one that had imposed their rule on the Wissen people. None of the citizens would fight for them, and Yang Ling was even less inclined to make himself cannon fodder for their benefit.</p> <p>Looking at the wide-eyed Steve, Yang Ling came up with an idea after a moment’s deliberation.</p> <p>“Yes, the Rossi soldiers definitely deserve death. I would defeat all of them if I had three thousand Steel Armor Guards!” Steve appeared to be elated after hearing this, and Yang Ling immediately went the other direction. “Unfortunately, on the orders of my family, I have to leave Wissen Town immediately. I couldn’t help even if I wanted to!”</p> <p>Leave Wissen Town immediately?</p> <p>Steve was nearly petrified. He had thought that Yang Ling would bargain with him and extort him. But in all his calculations, he had never thought that Yang Ling might be leaving Wissen Town immediately.</p> <p>Could this be just an excuse?</p> <p>After his shock, Steve forced himself to calm down quickly. “Brother Yang Ling, might I ask why your family has summoned you back so anxiously?”</p> <p>“A failure, I’m afraid. I am too embarrassed to say this!” Yang Ling sighed and shook his head. “Others in my family greatly boosted their cultivation level or gained control of large tracts of land. Even the worst of them earned a fortune; only I failed to accomplish anything. I can only return to receive my punishment. What a failure!”</p> <p>Since everyone thought of him as a noble that was born into a rich family, Yang Ling had decided to go with it, continuing the pretense. Others might choose to adopt a low profile and play dumb to take advantage of someone, but Yang Ling had decided to take the risk, pretending to be the aggressor to obtain an advantage. In the past, this method had shocked those with impure intentions, and it often had unexpected effects at critical moments.</p> <p>In the Tailun Continent, any member from a family with a long history would have to train outside when they came of age, thus Steve would find Yang Ling’s claim believable. In fact, even Goode, Harribell, and the rest were vulnerable to this lie. They all believed that Yang Ling was a member of a large family who had journeyed out into the world to train. The only difference was that while Steve was a little suspicious about whether Yang Ling was really leaving, the others knew that Yang Ling was only speaking nonsense.</p> <p>When Steve first arrived at Wissen Town, he would have been more than happy if Yang Ling had immediately left. After all, Steve would have been able to procure the majestic Wissen Castle without any effort. But if Yang Ling left now, it would definitely make the situation worse. The Rossi forces might attack even more viciously. Who knew if Steve would be able to last until his reinforcements arrived?</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, I’ll give you a piece of land with a thousand-mile radius in the northwestern area, and I’ll name you my Guardian Knight. Then you’ll stay and help me deal with the detestable Rossi soldiers. How about that?” After a moment’s hesitation, Steve made the huge offer so that he could complete the mission of occupying Wissen Town, and even more importantly, so that he could save his own life.</p> <p>Yang Ling had a great deal of influence. With his help, Steve would be able to last until his reinforcements arrived, then defeat the Rossi army in one fell swoop. Of course, he was giving Yang Ling the advantage for the time being. After he defeated the Rossi forces and established his control over Wissen Town, he had plenty of ways to get Yang Ling to hand back what he had been given.</p> <p>A territory with a thousand-mile radius?</p> <p>Even the leader of the barbarians Jarlock shook his head in disdain, thinking that Steve was dumber than a Sharo Boar. Yang Ling could become the Leader of Wissen himself after defeating the Banto soldiers by attacking alongside the Rossi. Even a fool would not accede to Steve’s conditions, obtaining only a small section of land after all that effort.</p> <p>“No problem. It is my honor to serve Sir Leader and to fight for the empire!”</p> <p>The crowd was shaking their heads in disdain, but surprisingly, Yang Ling accepted the offer after a moment’s deliberation. In that instant, Steve and his group were incredibly excited, while Casey, Jarlock, and the rest were dumbfounded, their mouths opened so wide that an egg could have been stuffed into them. Only Goode and Harribell were silent, having guessed Yang Ling’s intentions.</p>",
  "Chapter 102: Chapter 67 (Vol. 2)": "<p>It’s easy to defend against an obvious attack, but it’s hard to guard against something you don’t know is coming!</p> <p>Since he had already decided to deal with Steve, Yang Ling wanted to obtain victory at the lowest cost possible. He did not wish to suffer a loss of eight hundred men to kill a thousand of his enemies. Steve had offered to confer a piece of territory to him, and Yang Ling decided to go with the flow, first giving him a sense of stability, then dealing the fatal blow while the Banto army’s defenses were weakest.</p> <p>Yang Ling believed that after Steve made such an offer, he would have to depend on Yang Ling until his reinforcements arrived. He would not suspect Yang Ling for the time being, and that was a great opportunity. As long as Yang Ling planned this carefully, Wissen Town would become Steve’s burial ground.</p> <p>After Steve and his group departed, Yang Ling gave a mysterious smile to the confused Casey and barbarian Jarlock. He did not elaborate, but instead walked toward his villa with large strides. Recently, both his Wizard Power and psychic spell seemed to have reached a bottleneck. He had to achieve a breakthrough soon. In this world where the strong preyed on the weak, improving his abilities was the most important thing he could do.</p> <p>As soon as Yang Ling left, a commotion broke out within the meeting hall. Goode and Harribell knew what was going on, so they smiled and remained silent. Casey, Jarlock, and the rest didn’t know what was going on, and they argued for the longest time without understanding Yang Ling’s intentions. But they all shut their mouths when they left the hall; even the servants serving tea were no exception. They all knew what they should and should not say.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Three days later…</p> <p>Yang Ling slowly opened his eyes. The red Wizard Power and green life force in his body had become richer, circulating automatically on a mysterious path. Wherever they passed, Yang Ling’s muscles and bones continuously contracted, expanded, then contracted again. The cycle gave his body an explosive power.</p> <p>He believed that if he persisted in his training, he would one day breakthrough his bottleneck. The change in quantity would ignite a change in quality. Once he successfully advanced to the level of Earth Wizard and crystallized his Wizard Core, he would be able to train in the deeper regions of Terras Forest. Being able to absorb the life force of thousand-year-old ancient trees was secondary; it was more important to him that he could tame more powerful high level Magical Beasts and build a true Magical Beast army.</p> <p>Yang Ling had a large number of guards, but he was more interested in improving the ability of his Magical Beast army. If they were offered sufficient rewards, even the forest elves might turn their spears against him, much less the human warriors and barbarians. But the Magical Beasts would not do this. After being tamed, the Magical Beasts would never hesitate after receiving the order to advance, even if what lay ahead of them was a sea of blades and fire.</p> <p>In this world, there were no eternal friends, only eternal interests!</p> <p>Yang Ling knew that the mysterious wizard techniques and powerful Magical Beast army were his greatest means of ensuring that he could live a peaceful life in this foreign world. If he lacked strength, even the life of a beggar might be dangerous for him. He might be trampled to death like an ant one day.</p> <p>Patting the dust off his butt, he walked quickly toward Shangri-La. John’s reputation as a royal bartender was well deserved. Anybody who had tasted the cocktails he created would naturally get addicted. That was also the reason for the bustling business in Shangri-La’s small bar.</p> <p>The small bar was full of people even though it was early in the morning. Of course, the high chair that Yang Ling used exclusively was empty and untouched. Even though Yang Ling had not come for a few days, no one dared entertain any thoughts about the high chair. That was the highest respect the troops and adventurers would give to a powerful fighter.  ( Boxno vel. co m )</p> <p>After greeting a few familiar troops and servers, Yang Ling sat on the high chair. “John, as always, a glass of rum and two plates of Alpen Peanuts.”</p> <p>“Boss, I still have a bottle of the hundred-year-old Monkey Wine. Do you want to try it?” John picked out a bottle of pale green liquor from the cabinet. “It normally goes for two hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins, boss, but I’ll give you a fifty percent discount. A hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins is enough. Don’t miss it!”</p> <p>Yang Ling smiled and shook his head as he looked at John’s grin. That was the lie he had told Steve when the man was trying to woo Maryse. Yang Ling hadn’t expected John to turn the joke back on him. Yang Ling smiled. “Well, John, why don’t we try a glass of such a precious wine together? We can deduct the expenses from your salary!”</p> <p>Deduct a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins from my salary? Would that be my wages for the next hundred years or the next thousand?</p> <p>John nearly fainted, shaking his head and pretending to be pitiful. He poured a full glass of alcohol for Yang Ling and said, “Forget it; I do not dare lay a finger on such a good wine. I don’t even have a Black Crystal Coin on me right now, much less a hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins. The ladies these days are too much. A hundred crystal coins just to touch them. That’s even more expensive than the noble ladies in the capital! They sure are lawless. Boss, why don’t you deal with it personally!”</p> <p>I also have to deal with the prostitutes?</p> <p>Yang Ling almost spat out the indescribably-valuable Monkey Wine. John’s bartending skills were impeccable, but he was too much of a flirt. It looked like he needed a strong lady to keep a firm hand on him and prevent him from getting himself into trouble.</p> <p>“Sir, why are you so late today?” Maryse walked past some time later, dressed in a low cut black shirt. She smiled at Yang Ling. “I wonder if you are free to have a chat with me in private?”</p> <p>Maryse slowly walked toward the seat near the window after finishing her words, swaying with every step, her assets bouncing. The troops and adventurers nearby all swallowed hard.</p> <p>Similar to Yang Ling’s high chair, no one dared entertain any thoughts about that spot no matter how crowded it got. Over the previous weeks, the troops only had two forms of enjoyment when they came to the bar; one was to drink and brag, and the other was to look at the great beauty that was Maryse.</p> <p>A few days ago, a person who did not know any better sat in Maryse’s seat. In the end, he had not even warmed the seat when the rest of the crowd rained blows down on him and threw him out.</p> <p>Looking at the crowd staring at him in envy, Yang Ling shook his head and slowly followed. For safety’s sake, he slipped a Wizard Amulet out of his pocket. He could not understand Maryse, and he had to defend himself against her.</p> <p>Maryse was wearing a black shirt, and a black tulip adorned her chest. Coupled with her slender figure and faint fragrance, she looked like some sort of mythical succubus. Even Yang Ling couldn’t keep himself from stealing a glance whenever he had the chance, much less the lecherous troops and adventurers.</p> <p>“Beautiful, you’re too beautiful!” Yang Ling smiled and started at Maryse’s chest as he took a sip of the ice cold cocktail.</p> <p>Looking at Yang Ling’s naked gaze, Maryse felt joy instead of anger, but she feigned a look of shyness. “Sir Yang, thank you for your praise…”</p> <p>Looking at the proud Maryse, Yang Ling’s smile became even more radiant. “Miss Maryse, I’m saying that the tulip on your chest is too beautiful. Please do not misunderstand!”</p> <p>Tulip?</p> <p>“You…” Maryse gritted her teeth after recovering from her surprise, her full breasts rising and falling. She was fuming.</p> <p>Detestable, the lad Yang Ling was too detestable!</p> <p>If she hadn’t needed to successfully complete the mission of roping him into the Association of Dark Magic, if she hadn’t wanted to exact a cruel revenge upon him, Maryse would have turned Yang Ling into a skeleton using Dark Magic right there.</p> <p>“Sir Yang, could I, Maryse, be so ugly that I cannot face other people?” Maryse forced herself to calm down quickly after taking a few deep breaths, pretending to be pitiful.</p> <p>Retracting his smile, Yang Ling feigned sincerity. “No, Miss Maryse, in my eyes, you are as beautiful as a dinosaur!”</p> <p>Dinosaur?</p> <p>Maryse looked at Yang Ling in confusion. She did not know what he meant. She had heard of Holy Dragons and Ancient Dragons, but she had never once heard of a dinosaur.</p> <p>“The dinosaur is a beautiful little creature in my hometown. They have devilish figures and angel-like faces, and they are frequently used to describe a beautiful young lady. To a man, being able to take a dinosaur-like beauty as a wife would definitely cause a commotion!” Yang Ling said as he moved his eyes up and down Maryse’s body.</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, Maryse’s anger quelled a little. But she still felt as though something was off when she saw Yang Ling’s smile. She couldn’t figure out what was wrong, though.</p> <p>Taking a large gulp of her ice cold rum, Maryse once again forced herself to calm down. She was prepared to go straight to the point, directly explaining her identity and background. “Sir Steve was ambushed by a few men in black some time ago. Might I ask if you have any clues about that?”</p> <p>Hehe, it’s finally here!</p> <p>Yang Ling noticed that Maryse seemed to be implying a lot with her words. He decided to cope with whatever the conversation had to offer by sticking to his fundamental principle.</p> <p>“What, Sir Steve was attacked?” He shook his head, pretending to be surprised. “What bunch of b*stards did that, daring to ambush our respected Sir Leader? They must be tired of living! After I catch the culprits, I’ll send the males to dig in the mines, as for the females… Hehe!”</p> <p>“What are you going to do with the females?”</p> <p>Maryse was furious, seeing Yang Ling feign ignorance. She had encountered despicable pimps and traitors of their countries who had committed heinous evils, but she had never seen a more detestable person than Yang Ling.</p> <p>The men would be sent to work in mines, and Maryse knew what would await the females just from his expression alone. For him to say this right in front of her, he was going too far.</p> <p>Kill him?</p> <p>In her fury, Maryse instinctively took out a thin, pitch-black needle. When struck, even Steve’s Sword Saint warrior guard was unable to reverse the situation. Yang Ling, of course, wouldn’t stand a chance.</p> <p>Maryse’s face was steel green. She was motionless, as if waiting for a moment to strike. Yang Ling did not dare to wait around for her to act, either. He tried his best to circulate the protective Wizard Power, then he took out a bunch of Wizard Amulets with his left hand and formed a hand gesture with his right, preparing to summon his Magical Beast army.</p> <p>“Both of you, come, why not try this new wine?” Just as the battle was about to erupt, John walked over quickly carrying two glasses of a pale yellow cocktail.</p> <p>“Brother John, thank you!”</p> <p>Maryse quickly came to her senses after John’s interruption, understanding that this was not the time for her to strike. Otherwise, everything she had tried to accomplish before would have lost its meaning.</p> <p>More importantly, the current situation in Wissen Town was very delicate. According to reliable information, many high level warriors had rushed into Wissen Town after they heard that the relic containing the Undead Divine Weapons sealed by the Holy Dragon Ayrpaciro had been found in Terras Forest.</p> <p>Even though a large portion of the thousand-year-old monsters did not care to interfere in the battle between the Banto and Rossi forces, a major powerhouse like Yang Ling suddenly being killed would definitely attract their attention. If she inadvertently drew attention to Association of Dark Magic, and thereby foiling her teacher’s plans, then things would go poorly for her.</p> <p>Maryse had already been taught a harsh lesson by her teacher after she ambushed Steve. Their main objective in coming to Wissen Town was to obtain the treasures sealed by the Holy Dragon Ayrpaciro; everything else was secondary. Maryse knew what kind of punishment she would have to face if she carelessly foiled the plan that the association had worked on for many years.</p> <p>Hearing Maryse delicately call John “Brother John,” then looking at the smitten John, then looking at the surrounding troops and adventurers and their ugly expressions, Yang Ling shook his head. Beautiful women got unexpected privileges wherever they went.</p> <p>Yang Ling did not care for Maryse, but John seized the opportunity. “Miss Maryse, if you have some time tonight, I will treat you to the best cocktail. It will be like nothing you’ve ever tasted!”</p> <p>“Oh, I’m sorry, I already have a date tonight!” Maryse gave an alluring smile. She was familiar with dealing with a love-crazy person like John. She could have her way with him as she pleased.</p> <p>She already has a date?</p> <p>Looking at the alluring Maryse, then looking at Yang Ling lazily leaning back in his chair, John understood and backed down. Compared to Yang Ling, John knew that whatever he had to offer was insignificant.</p> <p>Taking a sip of the delectable wine John sent over, Yang Ling puckered his lips. “Ah, Miss Maryse, I was intending to ask you out tonight to do some exploring. It’s a pity, it looks like I won’t have the chance!”</p> <p>Do some exploring?</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, Maryse understood the meaning behind Yang Ling’s words and blushed. Her fair skin, perky breasts… The surrounding troops fell into a daze looking at her. In a mere instant, Yang Ling heard the crisp sounds of a dozen wine glasses falling onto the ground.</p> <p>“Miss Maryse, you’ll have to pay for my losses!” Yang Ling shook his head and came up with an idea when he looked at the surrounding troops and their ugly expressions.</p> <p>“Oh, what do you mean?” Maryse was a little nervous, not knowing what scheme Yang Ling had up his sleeves. Her heart told her that she had to be calm, she definitely had to be calm!</p> <p>“That’s a long story!” Yang Ling shook his head. “First, the troops had smashed so many wine glasses because of your beauty. I imported those glasses from the faraway Rossi Empire, and each one of them cost at least a hundred crystal coins. Some of them can’t be bought anymore, even if you have the money. Consider me unlucky; you can pay half and the troops will pay the other half!”</p> <p>“Oh, that is to say that being a little pretty is also my fault?” Maryse forced out a smile, then continued, “If that was the first reason, what is the other reason?”</p> <p>“It isn’t your fault if you are pretty, but wearing such revealing clothes and obviously flaunting your assets is not right. Furthermore, I came to the bar to relax, but your appearance has caused the troops to act like buffoons, putting me out of the mood to drink. Perhaps a value could be assigned to the glasses, but my mental health is priceless. Say, how are you going to pay me?”</p> <p>Wearing clothes that are too revealing and obviously flaunting my assets? Damaging his mental health?</p> <p>Maryse had never expected Yang Ling to say this. As she looked at Yang Ling’s smile, Maryse felt that she would go insane if they carried on like this. After clenching her teeth, she decided to directly expose her identity and status. But she felt that it was inappropriate to do so in front of the troops and adventurers looking at her. She wrote a few sentences on her handkerchief after some deliberation and slid it across the table to Yang Ling.</p> <p>“Sir, if you wish to know the identity of the men in black that attacked Steve, meet me tonight. Then, I’ll pay you whatever you want me to!” Maryse left quickly after whispering into Yang Ling’s ear.</p> <p>Yang Ling looked at the elegant handwriting on the handkerchief. Dawn today, Ladoja Valley, I’ll be waiting, Maryse.</p> <p>Recalling Maryse’s words, Yang Ling knew that this vixen was finally desperate enough to show her hand. But he could not eliminate the possibility that this was a trap, a gentle yet deadly trap.</p> <p>Yang Ling suddenly had a thought, recalling how smitten Steve was with Maryse. He came up with a bold plan after a moment’s deliberation. Maryse’s invitation was a challenge, but it was also a great opportunity, an opportunity that comes once in a lifetime.</p>",
  "Chapter 103: Who’s the Bait": "<p>After deciding on his plan, Yang Ling returned to make the preparations in Wissen Castle without hesitation. Soon, all the relevant personnel quickly started to act.</p> <p>Two hours later, in an army barracks at the southern outskirts of Wissen Town, Steve received a strange letter. There was no label or handwriting on the envelope. In order to guard against a possible Rossi scheme, a tactician carefully opened the envelope wearing a pair of rubber gloves, in case the envelope contained poison.</p> <p>Surprisingly, there was no letter within the envelope, only a handkerchief carrying a faint fragrance with a single line written on it.</p> <p>“Dawn today, Ladoja Valley. I’ll be waiting, Maryse.”</p> <p>“Maryse sent me a letter?” The tactician had just finished speaking when Steve snatched the handkerchief recklessly. As soon as he touched the handkerchief, he confirmed that this was a love letter given to him by Maryse. He had seen her elegant handwriting, and he could not forget the faint fragrance on the beauty’s body.</p> <p>Holding the pure white handkerchief up to his nose and taking a whiff of the faint fragrance, Steve was incredibly excited. Ever since he encountered Maryse in Shangri-La, he had fallen irretrievably in love with the alluring beauty in black. If not for his many duties in the army, if not for the blasted Rossi soldiers that came and went like ghosts, he would have gladly spent his days in Shangri-La with Maryse.</p> <p>The handkerchief… To think that she would use her handkerchief to promise to have a date with me!</p> <p>Steve almost started floating in joy. As a Casanova and a noble, no one was clearer than him on the hidden meaning behind a woman’s request for a date. Furthermore, she had used a handkerchief, an incredibly intimate item, to get his attention.</p> <p>When a woman was polite with you, it meant that she didn’t have feelings for you. When a woman started calling you “b*stard” or saying that she hated you, that meant that you had successfully attracted her attention.</p> <p>When a woman promised to go on a date with you, congratulations, you had already half-succeeded. If a woman asked you for a date on her own accord after not seeing you for two or three days, it was clear as day what her intentions were.</p> <p>Holding the fragrant handkerchief, Steve knew that Maryse would soon be his woman. She might not be his last woman, but she would definitely be the first and the last person that Steve had loved in his life.</p> <p>Looking at the excited Steve, the tactician hesitated for a long time as he steeled his nerves.</p> <p>“Sir, could this be a trap?”</p> <p>Now that the Rossi’s abilities had improved drastically, the outcome would be disastrous if they carelessly fell for an ambush once again. Previously, even the Sword Saint Barty met with misfortune. If they fell for an ambush once again, they might not be lucky enough to encounter the envoys of the Church for the second time.</p> <p>“That’s impossible!”</p> <p>Steve shook his head with determination. In his eyes, Maryse was as pure and beautiful as a fairy; she would definitely not have any relations to the despicable Rossi troops. Furthermore, no matter how perilous the situation, he was determined to honor the appointment. He would control a large piece of land if he subdued Wissen Town, but losing Maryse was akin to losing the whole world.</p> <p>People in passionate love were always blind, impulsive!</p> <p>The tacticians tried to caution him for a long time, but they eventually had to stop. Steve was determined to honor the appointment. But as a precaution, they suggested that he take five hundred elite personal guards with him. Steve did not object after thinking for a moment.</p> <p>After all, if he were to encounter any passing Rossi soldiers, he might have to rely on those five hundred men to free himself. He was personally familiar with danger, but he would deeply regret it if Maryse was injured in any way.</p> <p>Steve was adamant about honoring the appointment, and at the same time, the Rossi forces in Terras Forest also received the news from Parrot.</p> <p>“Dawn today, Ladoja Valley. The target is having an appointment with someone. You have to kill him in one strike!”</p> <p>Holding the simple piece of intelligence, Renaya was incredibly excited. The weather was getting colder, Steve’s reinforcements were getting closer, and the situation was getting worse. This was a rare opportunity.</p> <p>“Prince, this… Could this be a trap?” The tactician hidden in the darkness creased his brows.</p> <p>“Do we have any other ideas if we don’t take this gamble?” Renaya shook his head and let out a bitter smile. He had no other way out given the worsening situation. He could either choose to return to the empire and await his father’s punishment and the criticisms of the opposing factions, or he could choose to believe Yang Ling and risk it all in a gamble.</p> <p>But Renaya believed that Yang Ling did not dare play any tricks.</p> <p>Through a magical communication spell, Renaya knew that even though the crystal coins and Gaul Warhorses he promised Yang Ling were already on their way, they would not arrive at the border of Livenza for another ten days. He could order them to stop immediately if he sensed that something was off. As for the most important crystal mine, Yang Ling could only dream about starting work there if Renaya didn’t return to the Rossi Empire.</p> <p>Other than that, Yang Ling would require the support of the Rossi Empire if he wanted to be an independent leader. Otherwise, if he were on unfriendly terms with both the Rossi and Banto Empires, he would be left alone and without reinforcements. Even if he could develop the resources in Terras Forest on a large scale, he might not be able to sell them off. And if anyone sent in a few warriors to cause trouble, Yang Ling’s predicament would be even more difficult.</p> <p>After coming to a decision, Renaya decided to gather all of his brave warriors. His success and failure would all depend on this battle. He could not afford to fail.</p> <p>If he won, his hopes of ascending to the throne would increase drastically. If he lost, the outcome would be disastrous. His brothers in the royal family would not pass up on this chance to deal him a blow.</p> <p>Renaya had made a difficult decision, while Maryse was also nervously engaging in her preparations.</p> <p>A large group of knights in heavy armor and spellcasters in black robes had appeared in a corner of the Terras Forest. Their expressions were icy and all of them were silent, quietly looking at Maryse who was pointing and gesturing in front of a map.</p> <p>“Lady Maryse, you have decided to activate the Dark Shadow Knight Team?” A muscular knight creased his brows after understanding Maryse’s intentions.</p> <p>“Hmph. I’ll personally explain it to Elder Riquelme!” Maryse let out a cold grunt. She was very confident about this operation.</p> <p>Tonight, she had decided to show her hand to Yang Ling. It would be fine if he was smart enough to join the Association of Dark Magic. She would have her chance to get closer to him and set the foundation for breaking his psychological line of defense so she could cruelly exact revenge on him in the future. Eventually, in order to prevent Yang Ling from revealing anything, she would probably have to turn him into a corpse.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling had many warriors under him and possessed a powerful Magical Beast army, Maryse did not pay too much heed to his abilities. Compared to the elite Dark Shadow Knight Team, the guards under Yang Ling were basically a lowly bunch, unable to withstand a hit.</p> <p>As for Yang Ling’s Magical Beast army, Maryse believed that against her Dark Magic and the Dark Shadow Knights famed for their speed, Yang Ling would not have the time to summon his army.</p> <p>Steve, Renaya, and Maryse were all incredibly busy, each engaging in their own preparations. Only Yang Ling was very relaxed. After he told Goode his plan, he let the tactician plan and deal with the cumbersome details.</p> <p>After listening to Yang Ling’s schemes that were bordering on insanity, both Goode and Harribell were immensely shocked. If he was successful, Yang Ling believed that Wissen Town would be within reach, and no other factions would be able to stop him. If he were unfortunate enough to fail, the outcome would be incredibly serious. He might be faced with the combined retaliation of the other factions if he was not careful.</p> <p>This night was destined to be a troubled night!</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged in the middle of the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation and looking at the hazy moonlight, Yang Ling let out a cold smile, then slowly closed his eyes. A calm attitude and sufficient energy were important before an intense battle. Clearly, a short time in meditation was a decent choice.</p>",
  "Chapter 104: Ambush": "<p>The strange tall stones within Ladoja Valley looked especially sinister under the hazy moonlight. The cold wind that blew within the valley was ominous and frightening. After Yang Ling killed Ymir there, people frequently heard waves of frightening howls riding the cold wind.</p> <p>Some said that Ymir’s vengeful spirit was still lingering in the area, and some said that the mysterious Snake Demon Blood Staff had attracted a horde of wandering ghosts. Some even claimed that the Snake Demon Blood Staff had broken open the void and attracted the demons of Hell. More and more horror stories surrounding Ladoja Valley sprang out as the rumors spread.</p> <p>At the start, hunters who made a living from hunting did not pay too much heed to the rumors, often disregarding the tall tales that they heard. But ever since a young lad who could fight tigers and leopards barehanded turned into a lunatic after staying in Ladoja Valley for a night on a bet, the people finally recognized that the rumors were not unwarranted.</p> <p>Normally, many people came and went through Ladoja Valley. Now, it had become empty as the rumors spread. As time passed, Ladoja Valley felt even more sinister.</p> <p>It was still about an hour until dawn. Steve had hurried over with five hundred personal guards. Along the way, seeing that the route was becoming increasingly deserted, even Steve could not help but whisper, much less his soldiers. He could not understand why Maryse would arrange to meet him in such a barren place.</p> <p>Could it be that Maryse was prepared to offer her body to him tonight, so she had chosen the deserted location intentionally?</p> <p>Steve shook his head after a moment’s imagination, tossing away this unrealistic thought. Over this period of time, Steve had not even touched Maryse’s dainty hands, much less engaged in a carnal relationship. There was no way that Maryse would offer her body to him.</p> <p>Absentmindedly, Steve led the soldiers into the sinister Ladoja Valley, completely oblivious to the faint rings of water on the ground and the faint fragrance hanging in the air.</p> <p>If an experienced Spellcaster from the Church was there, he would definitely have turned around and left. Those were not ordinary traces of water; they were a terrifying dark magic, a dark magic used to conceal armies!</p> <p>The thicker the traces of water, the wider the radius of the rings, which meant that there were more troops hidden within them!</p> <p>After walking to the deep regions of the valley in confusion, Steve finally heaved a sigh of relief when he saw a familiar slender figure standing underneath a large tree. He instructed his soldiers to stop, then led a few personal guards as he walked quickly toward the tree.</p> <p>“Miss Maryse! I’m sorry, I came late!”</p> <p>Seeing Maryse alone, Steve knew that he had been too paranoid. He removed his pitch black mask as he spoke. Before he came there, he had heeded the advice of his tactician and put on the armor his family had made for him as a precaution.</p> <p>“Oh, Steve? Why are you here?” Maryse was very shocked when she saw Steve, who was removing his mask as he walked toward her.</p> <p>( Boxno vel. co m )    She had been confused by the figure walking towards her, as it didn’t look quite like Yang Ling. But she hadn’t thought too much about it, as she attributed it to him wearing armor. She only realized that something was wrong when the man took off his mask!</p> <p>Not good! I fell for a trap!</p> <p>Steve was completely oblivious that he was at Death’s door, and Maryse did not have to think too deeply to understand that she had once again been fooled by Yang Ling. She had been completely wrong. She had thought that she could take the opportunity to capture Yang Ling, but she did not expect herself to so foolishly act as his bait.</p> <p>After clenching her teeth, Maryse came to a swift decision. She ordered the hidden troops to retreat immediately, then rushed past Steve like the wind. “Steve, we have all fallen into a trap! Retreat quickly if you do not wish to die!”</p> <p>There’s a trap?</p> <p>Steve was dazed when he saw Maryse quickly disappear into the darkness. He did not expect the beauty to leave him this quickly without saying a word despite his day of excited preparations.</p> <p>Thinking back to how Maryse had brushed past him icily with that cold and unfeeling gaze in her eyes, he felt as though the sky had cracked into many pieces. Wronged, depressed, despairing… In that instant, his heart seemed to have been pierced by a knife and shaken violently, leaving his weak heart in countless pieces.</p> <p>“Quick, protect the lord! Retreat!”</p> <p>Steve was depressed, unable to come to his senses, but the tactician not far behind him reacted quickly. Even though he had not heard Maryse’s words of caution, he instinctively felt that something was off when he saw how speedily and mysteriously she had left.</p> <p>Steve’s personal guards reacted quickly, but they were too late!</p> <p>With an angry growl, a large group of Rossi soldiers suddenly charged out of the nearby forest with heavy crossbows in hand. In a mere instant, dozens of Banto soldiers in black heavy armor fell to the rain of arrows. At such close range, the black heavy armor that they were so proud of could not hold up against the terrifying heavy crossbows.</p> <p>“Raise shields and get into formation! Protect the lord!”</p> <p>The Banto people quickly raised their shields and got into formation under the commands of their leader. They braced themselves against the Rossi’s rain of arrows, protecting Steve with all their might. Unfortunately, the concentrated rain of arrows frequently hit the soldiers, especially the Spellcasters who had followed the army here. They were heavily targeted, and their pathetic cries rang in the air.</p> <p>“Sir, we fell for a trap, retreat, retreat quickly!”</p> <p>Seeing the unfavorable situation, a few of Steve’s personal guards shouted as they urged him to retreat. The Rossi soldiers were ferocious. They might have set up a heavy ambush around the area. If Steve’s men did not retreat soon, they might be exterminated in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>If the heavy crossbows of the Rossi soldiers had caused much trouble for the Banto people, then the subsequent attack from their cavalry would scatter their souls.</p> <p>“Uraaa, Uraaa…”</p> <p>With the low pitched sound of a horn, a team of heavily armored Rossi cavalry gave a war cry as they charged over a small hill. They accelerated with the downward slant of the hill, charging fiercely into the Banto formation like a sharp knife.</p> <p>Caught off guard, the Banto formation slipped into chaos. No one had expected such a large group of Rossi reinforcements to have arrived, or for them to have brought so many warhorses and such advanced weaponry. Most importantly, no one could have known that all of this was due to Yang Ling interfering behind the scenes.</p> <p>Some time ago, to comply with Renaya’s request, Yang Ling had paid the dwarf Rumi and a large group of steelsmiths to forge the best weapons and armor they could for many of the Rossi soldiers. He had also secretly purchased a group of warhorses from the troops and adventurers in town.</p> <p>The Rossi Empire was situated in the north, and snow fell in much of its land all year round. The climate was harsh, their people full of grit. They had countless wide pastures in their vast land. They grew up on horses, and their riding skills were impeccable. They were regarded as the Country on Horseback.</p> <p>Over the millenia, the Rossi people had built their nation and taken over much of the world with their cavalry, unparalleled. Their only rivals were the powerful Delar Empire in the west and the Banto Empire in the south, both of which were famous for their magical spells.</p> <p>The Rossi people might not have been the most impressive when it came to the individual abilities of their troops, but the situation changed completely if you gave them a horse. The Rossi were the best horseback fighters in the entire Tailun Continent.</p> <p>Even though the situation was dire, the Banto people fought back to the best of their ability under the command of their leader.</p> <p>The few Spellcasters who were lucky enough to survive gathered around Steve, displaying their might under the cover of the infantry. Some joined hands and conjured a magical barrier to defend them against the long range attacks of the Rossi soldiers, and others used all the tricks up their sleeves to defend against the Rossi cavalry who were charging toward them.</p> <p>Unlike the Rossi Empire in the north, the Banto Empire in the south didn’t breed warhorses due to their warm climate. Over the millennia, they had built their country on their massive numbers of Spellcasters and infantry troops. As long as they were in formation, the infantry and Spellcasters would complement each other. Their elite forces could even hold their own against a direct attack from the Rossi cavalry in the wilderness.</p> <p>The five hundred soldiers Steve brought with him were all elites amongst the elites, and all of them were incredibly experienced. With the cooperation of their Spellcasters, they would not pale in comparison to even the elite Rossi cavalry. Unfortunately, after being caught off guard and losing a large portion of the Spellcasters accompanying their army, the battle abilities of the entire unit had been diminished a great deal.</p> <p>The battle is lost!</p> <p>With his personal guards falling around him, Steve had no choice but to engage in battle himself. He led the rest of his troops and fought back to the best of his abilities. His messenger had already gone back to gather reinforcements, and Ladoja Valley was not very far from the army barracks. The army back in the base would be able to arrive in about an hour after being notified.</p> <p>Steve and his group were caught off guard, and they suffered heavy casualties in the blink of an eye. But with them bitterly resisting, the Rossi soldiers were unable to secure a full victory for the time being. After all, Steve had brought with him a full five hundred elites. As people said, even a starving camel was still larger than a horse.</p> <p>In their heated combat, neither the manic Rossi soldiers nor the defending Banto soldiers noticed that there were a few dark figures hiding in the shrubs further away.</p> <p>“Argus, where are Steve’s reinforcements now?” Yang Ling turned to ask the leader of his guards, seeing that Steve and his group wouldn’t be able to last for much longer.</p> <p>According to his ploy, Yang Ling had notified the army back in Steve’s base immediately after Steve met with the ambush. This way, both the Banto and the Rossi would suffer heavy casualties, and through that, Yang Ling would be able to successfully seize control of Wissen Town. But seeing Steve’s heavy casualties, Yang Ling knew that the situation might be out of his calculations if Steve’s reinforcements did not arrive soon.</p> <p>“Sir, Parrot has already successfully completed their mission and notified the army Steve left behind.” Argus paused, then continued, “According to our scouts, they will arrive in an hour!”</p> <p>An hour might only be enough time for an average person to drink a cup of tea, but it was more than enough for the fully prepared Yang Ling! He had plenty of time to mobilize his army and completely eradicate Steve’s forces.</p> <p>“Great, let’s go! Follow the plan. Instruct the warriors to change into the equipment of the Rossi Empire!”</p> <p>“Yes, I understand!”</p> <p>After shooting a cold look at Steve, who was struggling bitterly on the battlefield, Yang Ling retreated, moving rapidly toward Steve’s lightly defended base. Argus followed closely behind him, leading Yang Ling’s guards.</p>",
  "Chapter 105: Sieging the Base": "<p>After getting the news of Steve encountering an ambush, the Banto troops that had stayed behind to guard the base did not dare to hesitate. They would rather believe the news and set off immediately. As a precaution, they left behind nearly eight hundred troops to guard the base.</p> <p>Eight hundred troops was considered an incredibly small number in the frontlines of a war or a large city, not worthy of mention. But in the remote Wissen Town, they were already a relatively powerful force. Even if the Rossi soldiers launched a surprise attack against the base, they might not even breach the base without losing all their numbers.</p> <p>The simple yet sturdy wooden wall and tall towers for archers, coupled with the hidden scouts and active patrol squad all allowed the Banto soldiers left behind to sleep peacefully. No one thought that the Rossi forces would be foolish enough to siege the base. All of them went to sleep, each more deeply than the next.</p> <p>After seeing the reinforcement units disappear into the night, the Banto sentries slowly calmed down. Steve had taken five hundred elite personal guards with him, and now he had over a thousand troops rushing to his aid. With their numbers advantage, they would be undefeatable. In the best case, they might even exterminate the Rossi forces.</p> <p>Deep into dawn, when most people felt like sleeping, the sentries let down their guard after yawning a few times. Even the patrolling troops were no exception. Some of them skirted to the side to drink and gamble. Some gathered and bragged with one another. Some opted to find a corner and take a nap. No one noticed that a large group of uninvited guests had suddenly appeared in the forest near the base.</p> <p>After instructing a few Horned Bee Beasts to get rid of the Banto scouts, Yang Ling led his army and silently infiltrated the area around the other party’s base. The Banto soldiers had many hidden scouts in obscure locations. But against the sensitive, speedy Horned Bee Beasts, they were usually killed before they could react.</p> <p>Perhaps it was because they were stretched thin, or perhaps it was due to them thinking that they were powerful enough that no one would dare invade the base, the defenses of the Banto soldiers were not very powerful. One might even say that they were rather simple.</p> <p>Observing from above the treetops, Yang Ling noticed that there were about a hundred tents in the football field sized area of the base, surrounded by a nearly two-meter-tall, simple wooden wall. On each of the four corners was a tower, and each tower was able to hold twenty guards. Their firepower was severely lacking. Rather than a tower for archers, it was practically just a watchtower.</p> <p>The west side of the base was facing the mountains, while level ground surrounded the other three sides. It was not a place that was difficult to attack yet easy to defend. The mountains to the west were very steep. Yang Ling believed that he would be able to block the base’s western escape route just by stationing a hundred warriors in the mountains. As for the other three directions, even though they had the towers for archers and the wooden walls, Yang LIng believed that these defenses would be like a thin piece of paper in front of his Magical Beast army.</p> <p>Time is of the essence. The battle must be decided quickly! After understanding the basic situation, Yang Ling quickly thought about how he would invade the base.</p> <p>“Casey, quickly lead five hundred men and charge in from the east side after the Horned Bee Beasts deal with the troops on the towers. You need not leave anyone alive along the way; kill all that you come across!” Yang Ling gave a decisive order.</p> <p>“Yes, I understand!” The heavily armored Casey received the order with a bow.</p> <p>“Goode, charge in from the south with four hundred men. Kill all that you come across! Argus, you shall lead the personal guards and follow behind Goode and his army. You will be responsible for setting the fire!”</p> <p>“Yes, I understand!” Goode and Argus received the orders with a bow at the same time.</p> <p>Yang Ling sent a hundred elf archers to the mountains in the west. Yang Ling did not hesitate after the preparations were complete. He split the Horned Bee Beasts into four teams, each team targeting the Banto soldiers on the four towers. In that instant, the prepared Horned Bee Beasts split themselves into four teams and charged speedily toward the towers.</p> <p>The Banto soldiers on the towers were either sleeping while leaning on the wooden wall, or congregating together and talking about the coquettish noble ladies in the capital or the pretty young ladies in Wissen Town. They would let out rowdy laughs every time something interesting came up in their conversation. No one noticed the Horned Bee Beasts approaching them like a black cloud. They were completely oblivious to the impending disaster.</p> <p>“Omir, you sure are lazier than a Sharo Boar. When you’re relieving yourself from the archer’s tower, you should be careful not to hit the leader of the patrol squad. He’ll chop off your dick and feed it to the dogs!” Seeing Omir standing near the edge of the archer’s tower with his legs open, a soldier that could not go to sleep let out a few complaints.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, what are you scared of? The leader does this all the time.”</p> <p>The soldier named Omir did not pay too much heed to the complaints, smiling as he unbuttoned his pants. But just as he was about to whip it out, he let out a sudden cry as he saw an unbelievable scene.</p> <p>“Hahaha, pitiful Omir, could he really have hit our leader?”</p> <p>“Hehe, Omir is finished. Even if he keeps his dick, the leader is going to kick the sh*t out of him!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The soldiers on the tower could not help but break into laughter when they saw the dumbfounded Omir. But just as they were about to stand and see what was going on, they suddenly saw a bunch of ferocious Horned Bee Beasts swarming toward them in the night.</p> <p>Where did this many Horned Bee Beasts come from?</p> <p>Looking at the horde of fist-sized Horned Bee Beasts, the soldiers all rubbed their eyes, unable to understand what they were seeing. They didn’t know how to react.</p> <p>As a low level Magical Beast, the Horned Bee Beasts could be seen everywhere within Terras Forest. But fist-sized Horned Bee Beasts that had angled wings were a rare sight, much less a large group suddenly appearing at one time. In that instant, almost all of the soldiers thought that they were seeing things.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts were fast, flying in amongst the soldiers while the soldiers were still overthinking things.</p> <p>An enemy attack! Not good!</p> <p>Seeing the Horned Bee Beasts flashing towards them like lightning with their extended stingers and bared fangs, the soldiers instinctively felt that something was off. But it was too late, the fast Horned Bee Beasts fired poisonous stingers before the soldiers could sound the alarm.</p> <p>They were too fast!</p> <p>The soldiers could only see a cold gleam flash past their eyes, and then poisonous stingers planted themselves into the soldiers before they could react. Their bodies turned numb, falling helplessly to the ground. All they could do was look on helplessly as the horde of Horned Bee Beasts swarmed forward and tore through their flesh.</p> <p>“Attack! Kill all that you encounter!”</p> <p>Yang Ling let out a decisive order after the surprise attack of the Horned Bee Beasts succeeded. He leapt up onto his Unicorn and commanded his Magical Beast army to launch a strong offensive on the main entrance of the Banto base.</p> <p>Leading the army were the artillery-like Evil Eye army. Under the command of the Evil Eye Tyrant, a concentrated rain of light fell onto the Banto base. Unable to avoid the attack, the Banto soldiers guarding the man entrance were all blasted to a pulp. Unfortunately, the range of the Evil Eyes was limited. Otherwise, just the Evil Eye army alone would have been enough to exterminate the Banto soldiers.</p> <p>After a few barrages of attacks, the Gargoyles were the first to move. While they did not have great numbers, they were incredibly fast and had precise attacks. They targeted the soldiers not hit by the rain of light, rapidly clearing a path for the army.</p> <p>The air was the domain of the Gargoyles and Horned Bee Beasts, but the tank-like Withered Tree Warriors were unparalleled when it came to attacks on the ground. The thin wooden wall of the Banto base was like cardboard in their eyes. They downed a portion of the wall with every kick. They turned the struggling Banto soldiers into mush every time they encountered one. They advanced quickly toward the tents within the wooden wall.</p> <p>Behind the Withered Tree Warriors was the mass of the spider army. After charging quickly into the base, the Tarantula King instructed the spiders to attack the Banto soldiers who had been scared awake from their dreams.</p> <p>( Boxno vel. co m )      They were not as powerful as the Evil Eye army in terms of long range attacks, and they couldn’t compare to the bulldozer-like Withered Tree Warriors in terms of pure physical strength. But their numbers made them powerful. No one could defend against the tidal assault of the spiders. Their sharp poisonous fangs and fatal venom turned them into the reapers of the souls of the Banto soldiers.</p> <p>After being shocked awake from their dreams, facing the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles covering the sky, facing the countless spiders on the ground, facing the giant Withered Tree Warriors, the Banto soldiers nearly died on the spot.</p> <p>In their shock, the soldiers hurriedly fled, running faster than a hare. But it was all for naught before the speedy Magical Beast army. They were drowned by the tide of Magical Beasts in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>Yang Ling was formidable, but Casey and Goode did not meet with much resistance either. The barbarians holding tire-sized axes were undefeatable, and the archers and swordsmen behind them were also incredibly powerful. They annihilated the Banto forces they encountered.</p> <p>The flustered Banto generals and soldiers could not find each other or organize a successful retaliation. A few low ranking generals had just gathered a few troops to defend against the attack when they were torn apart by the Horned Bee Beasts or Gargoyles swarming forward.</p> <p>After understanding that they had already lost, a few of the Banto soldiers charged toward the base of the mountains in the west, hoping that they could scale them to escape. But unfortunately, they were either picked off by the Horned Bee Beasts circling in the air or fell during the journey due to their nerves. Even those who were lucky enough to scale the steep cliff were picked off one by one by the elf archers.</p> <p>This wasn’t a perfect surprise attack; it was a bloody massacre. In front of Yang Ling’s fierce guards and massive Magical Beast army, the unprepared Banto soldiers did not have the chance to retaliate. Some of them were killed before they even woke up.</p> <p>“Quick, set the fires, quick!”</p> <p>Yang Ling moved around on his Unicorn, instructing Argus to attack. He wanted to burn down Steve’s base, completely eradicating his faction from Wissen Town. Without rations or a base for him to replenish his weapons, Steve would not be able to act as he wished even if he managed to defeat the Rossi soldiers with the help of his reinforcements.</p> <p>Recalling his Magical Beast army, Yang Ling left quickly with his army after burning the Banto base and intentionally leaving behind the weapons and armor of the Rossi soldiers. Even if Steve returned alive, he would furiously assume that this heinous act was committed by his mortal enemy, the Rossi forces.</p> <p>No matter the occasion, obtaining the largest profit at the lowest price was the best thing one could do!</p> <p>Yang Ling was unwilling to miss any opportunity to benefit from the situation. The more intense the battle between the Banto and Rossi soldiers, the more benefits he could obtain, be it now or in the future!</p>",
  "Chapter 106: Splitting Up": "<p>After quickly retreating from the burning Banto base, Yang Ling ordered the warriors to stop in a forest to rest and take off their Rossi weapons and armor.</p> <p>“Sir, according to the scout’s report, the Banto and Rossi soldiers have both suffered heavy casualties from their battle!” The tactician Goode walked quickly toward Yang Ling after changing out of his blood-covered jacket. “Now, our true threat is not Steve, who’s locked in combat, nor the Rossi soldiers, who have suffered heavy casualties. Instead, it’s the ten thousand Banto reinforcements that are speedily making their way toward Wissen Town!”</p> <p>At Goode’s reminder, Yang Ling quickly remembered the Banto army that was quickly rushing towards them. He recalled the Aila Mountain Pass that was hard to attack, but easy to defend.</p> <p>He had recruited many people to build the first line of defense at the mouth of the Aila Mountain Pass, but there would definitely be gaps in the defenses given how hurried the builders had been. Also, even though the scout had said that the Banto reinforcements were at least five days away, the defenses at the mouth of the Aila Mountain Pass were flimsy. No one could guarantee that the defense would go smoothly.</p> <p>“Sir, in this situation, it would be best to split the army into two. One group should head toward Ladoja Valley to clean up the battle and gain complete control of the situation in Wissen Town. The other group will head to the Aila Mountain Pass overnight and prevent the Banto reinforcements from sending out cavalry to launch a surprise attack.”</p> <p>Goode was worried. According to the report of the scout, the Banto reinforcements consisted of a team of five hundred cavalry units. If they did not strengthen the defenses at the pass soon, the outcome could be disastrous if the enemy cavalry launched a surprise attack.</p> <p>“What’s the situation in Ladoja Valley? How many men are there left for the Banto and Rossi forces?” Yang Ling asked Goode after a moment’s deliberation.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s grave expression, Goode immediately described the latest intelligence given to him by the scouts.</p> <p>The Banto reinforcements had charged into Ladoja Valley without much care. They had paid a heavy price, even if they had managed to save Steve in time. Their formation had been disrupted by the Rossi cavalry, and the Spellcasters following their army were largely killed by the heavy crossbows. Even though they had managed to stubbornly defend themselves with their numbers advantage, they had suffered heavy casualties in just an hour’s time. According to the estimates of the scout, they probably only had three hundred men left.</p> <p>Rossi soldiers were not any better off. Even though they had triumphed over the Banto soldiers despite being weaker by initiating an ambush, they also suffered a huge loss when faced with the numbers advantage of the Banto soldiers and their stubborn retaliation. It was estimated that they only had two to three hundred soldiers left from their team of seven hundred.</p> <p>They were both left with two to three hundred people?</p> <p>After his elation, Yang Ling quickly thought up an idea. Those who survived after the hard battle between the Banto and Rossi forces would be fatigued and weak. If that was the case, he did not need too many of his forces to control the situation.</p> <p>“Casey, lead eight hundred warriors and ride through the night to Aila Mountain Pass. You have to reach it in two days. You have to hold the first line of defense, no matter what!” Yang Ling gave a decisive order after a moment’s deliberation.</p> <p>“Yes, I understand!” Casey bowed and left after receiving the order.</p> <p>“Sir, to mobilize eight hundred warriors in such a short span of time, could it be…” Goode creased his brows as he looked at Yang Ling, worried.</p> <p>“It’s alright. My Magical Beast army is more than enough to deal with the leftover soldiers at Ladoja Valley.”</p> <p>Yang Ling was very confident in his Magical Beast army. He might have even been able to deal with the three thousand Black Armor Guards under Steve with careful planning, much less a bunch of leftover soldiers. All that was different was the scale of his losses.</p> <p>After seeing Casey leave with the army, Yang Ling did not hesitate any longer. He got onto his Unicorn and led the rest of his warriors to Ladoja Valley. As long as he could quickly control the situation in Wissen Town, he would be able to divert a larger portion of his forces to the Aila Mountain Pass and push back the Banto reinforcements.</p> <p>Under the guidance of the scout, they soon silently reached the bloodied Ladoja Valley.</p> <p>The valley was covered in blood and dismembered limbs. Originally, the Rossi soldiers had been prepared to make a quick retreat after killing Steve. Unexpectedly, they suddenly encountered a large group of Banto reinforcements, slipping into a chaotic battle. Even though the powerful cavalry and terrifying heavy crossbows were able to kill many of their enemies, they had also paid a heavy price.</p> <p>The Banto soldiers had wanted to retreat from the valley after saving Steve. They wanted to reorganize themselves before they counterattacked. But unexpectedly, the Rossi cavalry had disrupted their formation and the Spellcasters had been killed by the heavy crossbows.</p> <p>To the two parties engaged in the brawl, it was the wrong time, the wrong place, and an unexpected battle!</p> <p>The Banto soldiers thought that a large batch of reinforcements had arrived for the Rossi, bringing with them powerful warhorses and terrifying heavy crossbows. They suffered heavy losses after being caught off guard. If they had known of this information beforehand, they would definitely not have been willing to abruptly engage in a battle with the elite Rossi cavalry.</p> <p>The Rossi soldiers would successfully foil the strategies of the Banto Empire as long as they killed the leader Steve. They did not expect their enemy to engage them head on. Unfortunately for them, they encountered the strong Banto reinforcements, unintentionally slipping into an all out deathmatch.</p> <p>This is almost too perfect!</p> <p>Looking at the heated Banto and Rossi soldiers, Yang Ling understood that he had once again made the winning gamble. The more intense the battle between the Banto and Rossi soldiers, the more advantageous it was for him.</p> <p>After the heavy casualties, both sides had succumbed to their bloodlust, and the ferocious Rossi people even let their bestial qualities erupt. The few Rossi cavalry units left charged forward under the lead of Renaya, their sharp lances covered in blood. No one knew how many of the Banto they had killed.</p> <p>After failing to break out of the embattlement several times, faced with the fearless Rossi soldiers, Steve had no choice but to order his soldiers to retaliate with all their might. Unfortunately, after losing a large portion of their Spellcasters, they were only left with thirty percent of their full power. They were unable to avoid the enemy’s heavy crossbows, nor could they defend themselves against the famous Rossi heavy cavalry.</p> <p>Slowly, with the powerful attacks of the Rossi soldiers, the Banto forces were once again at a disadvantage. With the soldiers falling one by one, Steve’s situation became more and more dire. Unless something changed, this sinister valley would become his grave.</p> <p>Sprawling under a shrub and looking at the fearful Steve, Harribell had a thought after recalling the family backing him. She silently made her way to Yang Ling’s side and whispered, “Yang Ling, our motive is only to seize control of Wissen Town. Steve dying here is not good for us!”</p> <p>Killing Steve is not a good thing?</p> <p>Looking at the silent Harribell, Yang Ling creased his brows, not understanding what she meant.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s confusion, Harribell quietly began her explanation.</p> <p>It turned out that Steve was from the Waize family, a large family with a deep history in the capital of the Banto Empire. They had thousands of years of history and an incredible influence within the capital of the Banto Empire. Yang Ling’s operation from the shadows wouldn’t fool those sent to investigate what had happened. Even if they were able to fool everyone for the time being, they could not keep this a secret forever.</p> <p>The Banto Empire wanted to occupy Wissen Town because of the resources in the Terras Forest. After Yang Ling foiled their plan to occupy Wissen Town, the Banto Empire might not be able to act aggressively toward the new leader of Wissen Town if Yang Ling had the support of the Livenza Alliance, the Rossi Empire, and other countries.</p> <p>But the situation would become more complicated if Steve died in Ladoja Valley!</p> <p>The Waize family would definitely not let the matter rest, and they would pin the blame on Yang Ling, who had planned everything. With them fueling the situation and seeking retaliation, Yang Ling might become the mortal enemy of the Banto Empire. To the new leader of Wissen Town, this would definitely be more of a bane than a boon.</p> <p>After all, no matter how strong an individual was, no one could deal with a powerful nation alone. Yang Ling would be no exception, even if his Magical Beast army was ten times stronger than it was now.</p> <p>If the Banto Empire decided to, they would be able to gather an army of a hundred thousand men from the provinces nearby Wissen Town in just a month. They wouldn’t need much time to level Wissen Town.</p> <p>Other than thinking about the big picture, Harribell also had a personal reason. The Boulade Merchant’s Association under her control had several industries in the Banto Empire, which contributed a great deal of profit every year. If Steve were to die in Wissen Town, the Waize family would be able to find out the truth in a short span of time given their influence. When the time came, her businesses in the Banto Empire would definitely suffer an unimaginable hit.</p> <p>After burning the Banto base and eradicating their faction in Wissen Town, there was no real point in killing Steve. Killing him might alleviate their fury, but it was definitely not a good thing for them in the long term.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, seeing Yang Ling begin to form his thoughts, Harribell continued, “Steve’s father is a finance minister in the Banto Empire, and his position and influence are great. If we save Steve and find a way to establish friendly connections with the Banto Empire, we might be able to receive unexpected benefits!”</p> <p>Finance minister?</p> <p>Yang Ling came up with an idea after a moment’s deliberation. He quickly summoned his Magical Beast army.</p> <p>There were no eternal friends between countries, nor were there eternal enemies. There was only an eternal interest. It was worth it to gamble for their future development.</p> <p>Steve felt his limbs turn cold as he saw his personal guards falling one by one.</p> <p>Originally, he had placed his hopes on the eight hundred soldiers left in his base, but his heart sank when he saw the flames in the direction of his base. Looking at the Rossi heavy cavalry that had suddenly appeared, looking at the powerful heavy crossbows, he understood that a large group of Rossi reinforcements had arrived and set up a large scale ambush.</p> <p>In his daze, Steve was completely oblivious to the handful of Rossi heavy cavalry units approaching him at high speed. The guards around him were shocked. At the critical moment, when the Banto guards were unable to get to Steve, a large horde of ferocious Horned Bee Beasts suddenly flew out from the darkness, pressing toward them fast as lightning.</p>",
  "Chapter 107: Setting Up a Defence": "<p>In the face of Yang Ling’s powerful Magical Beast army, the Rossi soldiers who had wanted to exterminate the Banto forces had no choice but to stop in their tracks and let Steve go.</p> <p>In order to successfully execute the next step of the plan, Yang Ling ordered Goode to escort Steve and his group back to Wissen Castle. He gave the excuse of protecting Steve from the sneak attacks of the Rossi forces, but in actuality, Yang Ling wanted to place Steve under house arrest.</p> <p>A count after the battle revealed that only about a hundred of the Rossi soldiers remained, and almost all of them were injured, including the prince Renaya. The Rossi had suffered heavy casualties, but the Banto were nearly exterminated, with merely a few dozen people left.</p> <p>( Boxno vel. co m )   All that was left of the three thousand Black Armor Guards were a few dozen people!</p> <p>Steve walked past the burning army camp, seeing the charred corpses within the camp, then looking at the few soldiers he had left beside him. He wanted to cry, but no tears came out.</p> <p>Seeing the Rossi armor left behind on the battlefield, Steve knew that a large group of reinforcements had arrived for the Rossi. They had set up an ambush and launched a surprise attack at his camp. He swore to himself that he would one day eradicate the detestable Rossi entirely.</p> <p>Steve was gritting his teeth and swearing to himself, while in Ladoja Valley, Renaya was also extremely displeased. He was displeased that Yang Ling was slow to aid him, and even more displeased that Yang Ling had saved Steve at the critical moment. He only slowly calmed down after he learned that Yang Ling had launched a sneak attack at the Banto base.</p> <p>The greatest mission of the Rossi soldiers was to foil the plans of their mortal enemy. With the Banto forces nearly exterminated, their claim over Wissen Town was basically non-existent. At this point in time, whether Steve lived or died was no longer important. After this, as long as Yang Ling was able to defend the Aila Mountain Pass and push back the Banto reinforcements, it could be said that the Banto Empire’s plans were foiled.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, why did you save Steve?” Even though he had calmed down, Renaya still held a grudge in his heart.</p> <p>“Prince, the Banto soldiers have ten thousand men coming to reinforce them. How can I fight against them with my measly powers?” After shaking his head, Yang Ling pretended to let out a sigh of frustration. “I am embarrassed to say this, but I saved Steve with the intention of taking him hostage in order to ensure my survival!”</p> <p>Holding Steve as a hostage? Hmph, he sure is more crafty than a fox!</p> <p>Renaya let out a cold grunt and did not comment. He recalled the time when he fell for Yang Ling’s schemes in Wissen Castle, and he could not help but once again acknowledge Yang Ling’s crafty nature.</p> <p>Having stayed by his father’s side for many years, he knew that a character like Yang Ling was the most difficult to deal with. Yang Ling might be siding with him today, but he might switch his allegiance to the Banto Empire the next day. At that moment, he wanted so badly to strike Yang Ling with a spear. Unfortunately, faced with the Magical Beast army baring their fangs around him and the delicate situation in Wissen Town, those were only passing thoughts.</p> <p>“Yang Ling, how confident are you of dealing with the reinforcements of the Banto Empire?”</p> <p>Even though the three thousand Black Armor Guards led by Steve had been mostly eradicated, Renaya was still worried when he thought about the ten thousand reinforcements rapidly making their way toward Wissen Town. If Yang Ling was unable to block the reinforcements and the Banto Empire staged a comeback, then their previous efforts would have been wasted.</p> <p>“Thirty percent, at most thirty percent!” Yang Ling shook his head and said directly, “To tell you the truth, my family is extremely displeased that I am acting on my own accord and have already made it clear that they will not provide any assistance. If the situation turns dire, all I can do is hand over the hostage Steve and hurry back home to acknowledge my mistakes!”</p> <p>He will retreat immediately if the situation turns dire?</p> <p>Yang Ling had just said this when Renaya almost vomited blood in anger. He hadn’t expected the crafty Yang Ling to fight to the death, but he had never thought that Yang Ling would be this thorough, prepared to give up at any time even though the battle had not begun!</p> <p>On the Tailun Continent, the more ancient the family, the more rules they had, and the stricter they were. Thus, Renaya was not suspicious of Yang Ling’s words. He was merely extremely displeased about Yang Ling’s intentions to give up at any time.</p> <p>Would Renaya have to rely on his hundred injured soldiers to deal with the ten-thousand-man Banto army?</p> <p>Renaya shook his head and abandoned the unrealistic thought. If Yang Ling were to flee without a battle, then his previous efforts would definitely have been wasted. Wissen Town would land in the hands of the Banto Empire. Unfortunately, he had only a hundred injured soldiers left under him. There was no way he could deal with the coming army, and thus he could only plant his hopes on Yang Ling.</p> <p>After swallowing hard, Renaya had no choice but to get off his horse and discuss the specifics with Yang Ling, from the security in Wissen Town to the defenses in the Aila Mountain Pass. They talked for a total of four hours. Faced with the tense situation and their unfavorable circumstances, Renaya had no choice but to compromise.</p> <p>With Harribell’s help, Yang Ling extorted a full five hundred thousand Purple Crystal Coins under the premise of recruiting troops and adventurers to aid in the defenses. Furthermore, claiming that he lacked powerful warriors, Yang Ling got Renaya to leave behind a hundred elite soldiers.</p> <p>After the battle, despite being covered in blood, the soldiers around Renaya were still filled with bloodlust. It was imaginable how fierce these soldiers were, truly living up to their reputation as the elite of the Rossi Empire.</p> <p>There were multiple reasons for having Renaya leave behind his personal guards.</p> <p>Firstly, when dealing with the Banto army, Yang Ling could have them take the frontline like cannon fodder. Secondly, their identity as Rossi soldiers would definitely cause a misunderstanding with the Banto troops. As long as Yang Ling planned it carefully, he might be able to ride on their reputation and instil fear in his opponent.</p> <p>Finally, Yang Ling believed that he could scare the troops and adventurers with ill intentions in town if they saw a bunch of elite Rossi soldiers serving him. That would give him a solid foundation for his successful control over Wissen Town.</p> <p>After promising to send over the crystal coins and warhorses as soon as possible, Renaya left, surrounded by a few dozen personal guards. After the great reduction of his troops, there was no more reason for him to continue staying in Wissen Town. He would rather return to the empire early to make the necessary preparations.</p> <p>If Yang Ling was lucky enough to hold the Aila Mountain Pass, Renaya could obtain credit from his father and fight for more power with the help of his tacticians. If Yang Ling was unfortunate enough to get defeated, he could also make preparations early to deal with the criticisms of his opponents and lower his losses as much as possible.</p> <p>Seeing Renaya and his group disappear into the forest not far away, Yang Ling did not stay any longer. He quickly recalled his Magical Beast army. He left behind a few barbarians to clean up the battlefield and bury the corpses, then quickly led his remaining men back to Wissen Castle.</p> <p>After returning to Wissen Castle, the first thing Yang Ling did was order for Steve to be kept in a small, desolate yard. Without Yang Ling’s orders, no one was to get near to Steve. Anyone who did would be killed.</p> <p>Just as Harribell had said, Steve himself was worthless, but the Waize family behind him was influential. If Yang Ling planned it well, he might even dispel the conflict between himself and the Banto Empire through the Waize family. He would be able to seize valuable time and space for the development of the newly inducted Leader of Wissen.</p> <p>Of course, it was not easy getting Steve to cooperate obediently.</p> <p>He would only feel how dire the situation truly was after Yang Ling convinced him that a large group of Rossi reinforcements had come and were constantly scheming to take his life. Yang Ling had to completely push back the ten thousand Banto reinforcements before Steve would finally give up and obediently cooperate with him.</p> <p>Whether he had the ability to negotiate with the Banto Empire, whether he could truly control Wissen Town, whether he could build a home base for his exploration of this world… All of this hinged on the Banto reinforcements!</p> <p>He needed a large number of warriors to fight back the Banto army, and he also needed powerful abilities to instill fear in the troops and adventurers and control the situation in Wissen Town. What could he do?</p> <p>Taking a sip of the jasmine tea Alice brought to him, Yang Ling gently rubbed his temple, once again feeling that his abilities were not enough. If he had a Magical Beast army of ten thousand strong, if he had ten Magical Beast champions like the Evil Eye Tyrant or Tarantula King, he would be confident of dealing with the sieging forces.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the total sum of his Magical Beast army was insignificant, far from enough to deal with the complicated, ever changing situation. It was also impractical to head into Terras Forest now to tame Magical Beasts such as Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts. He did not have enough time, nor did he have enough Magical Beast Blood Orbs to replenish his expended Wizard Power and Blood Essence.</p> <p>“Sir, how about we recruit a large number of troops and adventurers first thing in the morning?” Goode gave his opinion after understanding Yang Ling’s worry.</p> <p>Due to the rich resources, Wissen Town frequently attracted many troops, and coupled with the rumors of the lair of a giant dragon being found deep in the forest, there were even more foreign warriors in town at this point in time.</p> <p>According to the intelligence reports gathered by Parrot, there were at least five thousand foreign troops and adventurers in town. There were also a considerable number of people coming in every day. These forces were a double-edged sword. They would benefit him greatly if used well, but if he acted recklessly, they might become a source of trouble.</p> <p>A double bluff?</p> <p>After taking a sip of his jasmine tea, looking at the worried tactician Goode, Yang Ling had a thought. He recalled the story of how Zhuge Liang fought back Sima Yi with an empty city during the Warring Kingdoms period. Clenching his teeth, Yang Ling decided to gamble once more.</p> <p>“Goode, I’ll head over to the Aila Mountain Pass immediately. In the morning, bring gifts and gather a group of guards from the barbarian tribe, the dwarves, and the elves using my name. The more the better. Only start to recruit troops and adventurers after this army is gathered. Before that, be careful not to leak any information. You are not to act recklessly!”</p> <p>“Sir, this…”</p> <p>Goode was a little hesitant. Casey had already taken with him a large number of warriors. If Yang Ling left with his Magical Beast army, then Wissen Town would become an empty city. The outcome would be disastrous if the troops and adventurers with ill intentions knew about what was going on in Wissen Castle.</p> <p>“It’s alright, the Unicorn is very fast. If I leave now, I will be able to rush back by evening at the latest!”</p> <p>Yang Ling did not explain his plans even though he saw Goode’s worry. He left on his Unicorn after giving some instructions, rapidly making his way to the Aila Mountain Pass a thousand miles away. Before he left, he had a thought and brought along with him the Lion Flag of the Rossi people.</p> <p>Even though Casey had led eight hundred soldiers on horses toward the Aila Mountain Pass a few hours ago, they would still require a day or so to rush to the faraway Aila Mountain Pass. Until they arrived, there was only a team of commoners working on the defensive structures of the mountain. They would definitely not be able to withstand a blow if they encountered a surprise attack from the Banto army.</p> <p>The Unicorn was many times faster than a normal warhorse. Yang Ling wanted to rush to the Aila Mountain Pass to summon his Magical Beast army and set up his defenses before returning to Wissen Town. After that, even if he did not have any troops under him, he believed that the troops and adventurers would not dare act recklessly if he showed his face on his Unicorn around Wissen Town.</p>",
  "Chapter 108: The Carrot and the Stick": "<p>Terras Forest was dotted with mountains and spanned tens of thousands of miles. There were more mountains deeper into the forest, and they were even steeper than the mountains in the outskirts of the forest. Wissen Town was situated at the center of a small plain, with only a few small hills within a two hundred mile radius. But the mountain ranges became more frequent after walking out of the small plain.</p> <p>A few hours later, with the speed of the Unicorn, Yang Ling had successfully arrived at his destination.</p> <p>The Aila Mountain Pass was the main path in and out of Wissen Town. Even though one could make their way around this mountain pass, they would have to travel thousands of miles of mountainous paths and cross countless dangerous areas. The detour would take more than half a month. Thus, almost every merchant team used the pass instead. Aila Mountain was practically the only way in or out of Wissen Town.</p> <p>One man can hold a pass against ten thousand enemies!</p> <p>The Aila Mountain Pass had a treacherous path, with steep cliffs on both sides. Even a monkey would have difficulty scaling the cliff, much less a human. As long as they built a fortress along the walls of the cliff, they would be able to attack the enemy forces from the high ground. It was easy to defend and hard to attack.  ( B oxnovel.c om )</p> <p>Exiting the Aila Mountain Pass, one could see a boundless wasteland. Heading south and crossing the thousands of miles of nothingness, one would reach the expansive Banto Empire. If they headed west, they would reach the rich Livenza Alliance. If they headed north and passed a vast swamp, they would arrive at the powerful Rossi Empire.</p> <p>Securely controlling Aila Mountain Pass was equivalent to clasping the throat of Wissen Town.</p> <p>When Yang Ling arrived, the builders had already built a three-meter-tall wall under the directions of the craftsmen. The wall was about a hundred meters long and three meters thick, its main body built using sturdy Flower Rock. It was coated with an ash-like brown cement, its function to prevent the erosion of rainwater. From far away, it looked like a large dam used to collect water, or a giant dragon that was crouching on the mountains.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling placed the Rossi people’s Lion Flag on the wall. As Harribell had said, even though the Banto Empire was scheming to occupy the resource-rich Wissen Town, they would not dare to act on too large a scale for the time being, fearful that they would invite the interference of their mortal enemies. Now that he had placed the army flag of the Rossi Empire on the wall, the Banto reinforcements would have to think twice before they acted. They would be full of considerations!</p> <p>Any amount of resources was precious before a large battle. Of course, he was not going to place all of his bets on the battle flag of the Rossi. He summoned his Magical Beast army and instructed them to rapidly get into action.</p> <p>The Withered Tree Warriors turned into large trees and blocked the gates, while the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles were responsible for defending the critical gathering points. Even if there were no one to instruct them, they would still attack the sieging enemies on instinct alone.</p> <p>The Evil Eyes were responsible for defending from the top of the wall. With their concentrated firepower, Yang Ling believed that the attacking Banto army would have a hard time charging up the wall. The spider army dug into the sides of the meandering path, setting up a heavy ambush. The Banto would be fine if they did not approach, but if they charged forward with all their men to blockade the meandering mountain path, then the Aila Mountain Pass would become their burial ground.</p> <p>Unlike the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles that he needed to instruct himself, the Evil Eye Tyrant and Tarantula King had a certain level of intelligence and could flexibly instruct their respective armies to adapt to various situations. They were the true main forces of this battle.</p> <p>The Magical Beast army with their powerful attacks, Casey’s eight hundred warriors, and the natural threat that was the Aila Mountain Pass—Yang Ling believed that he would definitely be able to withstand the attacks of the Banto army. If the forces could cooperate with each other seamlessly and were given the right instructions, he might even be able to seize the opportunity and launch a counterattack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Banto army.</p> <p>After making the necessary preparations, Yang Ling left quickly on his Unicorn. There were only about two hundred warriors left in Wissen Town, and its defenses were lacking. It would be extremely dangerous if the troops and adventurers with ill intentions learned about this.</p> <p>Indeed, after returning to Wissen Town, he noticed that there were many people crowding in front of Wissen Castle. There were troops howling at the top of their lungs, as well as furious townspeople. The situation was chaotic.</p> <p>After recalling the Unicorn and secretly entering Wissen Castle, Yang Ling quickly looked for Argus who was responsible for the castle’s defenses. He soon got the gist of the situation.</p> <p>It turned out that while the people had not dared investigate the roaring sounds of battle last night, they had all tried to find out what had happened first thing in the morning. They all swarmed toward Wissen Town after learning that the Banto soldiers had been exterminated, and the violent, arrogant leader Steve had been captured. They were requesting that Steve be publicly executed immediately.</p> <p>Execute Steve in public?</p> <p>Faced with the furious townspeople, as well as the troops and adventurers who desired to see the world in chaos, Argus began to sweat profusely. But Yang Ling came up with a plan to take advantage of the situation.</p> <p>“Argus, get Steve out here!” Resummoning the Unicorn, Yang Ling mounted it quickly.</p> <p>“Yes!” Wiping away the cold sweat on his forehead, Argus left quickly with a few warriors.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling appear on the castle wall on his Unicorn, the people became much quieter. The troops that wished to see the world in chaos hid within the crowd like cowards. Yang Ling was not one to espouse justice and morals, and they did not wish to get electrocuted into ashes for crossing him.</p> <p>After a moment’s silence, the people once again broke into a commotion when they saw Argus bringing Steve out.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, kill him!”</p> <p>“Hang him on a tree and flog his corpse for three days before tossing it to the forest to feed the wolves!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Thinking back to Steve’s violence and arrogance, thinking back to the violence of the Black Armor Guards, the people were furious. If not for the castle wall being tall enough, Steve might have been crushed to death by the pebbles thrown by the crowd. He might even have been drowned alive by the saliva of the people.</p> <p>“Sir Leader, all of my troops have been sent to deal with the Rossi forces. Now the townspeople and troops are taking advantage of this and surrounding the castle, requesting that I hand you over immediately. I truly have no other choice, my apologies!”</p> <p>Looking at the pale Steve, Yang Ling pretended to shake his head in frustration. Giving Steve a strong blow and scaring him half to death was the only way to make him obediently follow Yang Ling’s plan. This was a good opportunity for him to make use of the fury of the townspeople.</p> <p>Looking at the furious townspeople, then looking at the troops flailing their weapons, the pale Steve swallowed with difficulty. As he was being detained in Wissen Castle, he had held on to the wild hope that Yang Ling would consider the fact that Steve had bestowed land upon him and try his best to fight back the Rossi soldiers and ensure his safety. But it looked like the situation was very dire.</p> <p>“Brot… Brother Yang Ling, why not gather all of your troops back to defend Wissen Castle? As long as you can last until the Banto reinforcements arrive, everything would be easy!” Thinking about the ten thousand reinforcements on the way, Steve seemed to have grabbed onto a life-saving rope.</p> <p>“Sir Leader, the situation is worse than you think. The Rossi people have already sent an army and sealed the Aila Mountain Pass!” Shaking his head, Yang Ling let out a heavy sigh and said, “I lost a few hundred warriors attempting to defend the pass. But unfortunately, I was unable to do anything!”</p> <p>The Rossi Empire sent an army to seal the Aila Mountain Pass?</p> <p>Steve shuddered. He could not find words for the longest time, as if he had been hit by a hammer. The fear of death was grabbing him by the throat like a demon. His legs shivered uncontrollably.</p> <p>He did not want to die!</p> <p>In the capital, he had a bunch of servants, countless fiercely loyal warriors, parents who would accede to his every request, innumerable beauties and good wine… He was incredibly regretful, regretful that he had rushed to Wissen Town with only three thousand warriors, regretful that he had ignorantly accepted the mission to occupy Wissen Town, regretful…</p> <p>“Kill him, kill him…”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, I’ll crush you, demon!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Looking at the pale Steve, the people became more and more furious, some shouting loudly while others looked for stones around them. If Yang Ling hadn’t been there, Argus was sure that the furious townspeople would have immediately begun shooting arrows towards Steve.</p> <p>In his daze, Steve remained motionless until a stone bounced off his forehead. His blood flowed incessantly as his body trembled.</p> <p>“Brother Yang Ling, you have to save me! As long as I can return to the Banto Empire alive, crystal coins, beauties, the position of Earl… I’ll give you anything you want!” Steve swallowed with difficulty, grasping at any hope he had of salvation.</p> <p>Anything I want?</p> <p>Yang Ling let out a handsome smile. He looked at the pale, helpless Steve, then at the furious townspeople, then at the vast mountain ranges. “I do not want beauties, nor do I want the position of Earl. I want… The entire town of Wissen!”</p> <p>Steve trembled. He could instinctively sense a scheme when he looked at Yang Ling and his cold smile. Steve was arrogant and accustomed to doing whatever he wanted, but he was not stupid.</p> <p>As Steve looked at him in surprise, Yang Ling said calmly, “The Rossi soldiers have set up a strong ambush in the Aila Mountain Pass. Your reinforcements would suffer heavy casualties even if they managed to avert the crisis, and they would be unable to control the situation in Wissen Town. In other words, you have already completely failed in your mission. Rather than scurrying back to the Banto Empire to receive your punishment, why not cooperate with me and work out a deal!”</p> <p>Steve was a little confused, not understanding what Yang Ling meant. But he knew that Yang Ling was far more crafty than he had imagined. Even if Yang Ling had not secretly interfered in his conflict with the Rossi soldiers, the man definitely hadn’t assisted Steve to the best of his abilities.</p> <p>“My proposal is simple. I need to control an independent land in order to prove to my family that my training was a success. Now that you have failed your mission, you will also need a reasonable excuse to escape the wrath of your king!” Yang Ling paused, then continued, “The reason your king wants to occupy Wissen Town is due to the rich resources in Terras Forest. As long as you can give him a large, stable supply of resources like Magical Beast Essence Crystals, timber, and minerals, I believe that you will not only convince the king to overlook your mistakes, you might even receive incredible rewards!”</p> <p>A large, stable supply of resources?</p> <p>Originally, Steve had been worried about how he could hide his mistake after returning to the Banto Empire. When he heard Yang Ling’s proposal, he couldn’t hide the gleam in his eyes. But after thinking about it more closely, he still felt as though something was off.</p>",
  "Chapter 109: Magical Beast Territory": "<p>“Sir Leader, I’ll give you three days. Consider my offer well!” Yang Ling ordered Argus to take the pale Steve back after giving him the cold warning.</p> <p>Returning to the small yard, Steve still felt that something was off.</p> <p>When Yang Ling had stepped in to save him, the timing had been too coincidental. Yang Ling hadn’t appeared with his army until after both Steve and the Rossi forces had suffered heavy casualties. That, coupled with his request for control of Wissen Town, made it clear that Yang Ling was hiding many things from him. There was even the possibility that Yang Ling was behind the near extermination of his troops.</p> <p>After careful deduction, Steve noticed more and more strange things about the current situation. He started to doubt that a Rossi army had actually sealed the Aila Mountain Pass. Perhaps Yang Ling was claiming this in the hope that Steve would give up on the plan of occupying Wissen Town and influence the Banto Empire into supporting Yang Ling as an independent ruler.</p> <p>After his many considerations, Steve found the courage to tell Yang Ling that he had to deliberate the matter for some time longer, hoping that he could get two more days for his reinforcements to charge into Wissen Town.</p> <p>Just as Steve was deep in his suspicions, a perfect counterattack happened at the Aila Mountain Pass.</p> <p>Under the leadership of the Evil Eye Tyrant and the cooperation of the Horned Bee Beasts, Gargoyles, and many warriors, the Evil Eye army successfully defended the pass against the powerful attacks of the Banto army.</p> <p>At the critical moment when the Banto soldiers went all out and sent their forces to attack, the Tarantula King led the spider army to emerge from under the ground. They not only severely damaged the Banto soldiers who were caught off guard, they even managed to kill the Banto leader in the chaos, completely scattering the enemy forces.</p> <p>The next day, Argus rode up to the castle holding a blood-covered flag and the severed head of the leader of the reinforcements. Steve and his tactician finally gave up. At this moment, whether or not Yang Ling had meddled in the incident was no longer of importance. They had to work with him if they wanted to live.</p> <p>In order to return to the Banto Empire alive and hide his mistakes, Steve had no choice but to agree to Yang Ling’s plan. After a series of secret negotiations, they created an explanation of events that contained only half the truth.</p> <p>In this fake report, Steve exaggerated the abilities of the Rossi army and stated how he managed to fight back the attacks of the Rossi soldiers despite the dire circumstances. He also said how he managed to triumph over the stronger Rossi army with Yang Ling’s help, and how Yang Ling had helped them obtain a large amount of Magical Beast Essence Crystals.</p> <p>At the end of the report, Steve made clear that he was no longer able to deal with the attacks of the Rossi soldiers after his close victory, and he was no longer able to control the situation in Wissen Town. He recommended that the king might as well support Yang Ling as the Leader of Wissen instead of sending in more reinforcements. They could use Yang Ling’s abilities to deal with the Rossi threat. That way, they could indirectly obtain a large amount of resources from the Terras Forest and fight to obtain the biggest benefit for the lowest price.</p> <p>With this misleading report, a large shipment of Magical Beast Essence Crystals, and the help of his family, Steve believed that he could quell the fury of the king even if he had to forgo the original reward. Of course, the price he had paid was huge! According to his agreement with Yang Ling, he had to pay a huge amount of crystal coins for every shipment of Magical Beast Essence Crystals, timber, and minerals they received.</p> <p>Carrying the forged document and a sample of Magical Beast Essence Crystals, one of Steve’s aides left for the faraway Banto Empire through the night. Yang Ling sent a team of barbarians to escort him. As for the once arrogant Steve, he had no choice but to stay in Wissen Castle, disconnected from the world, until the situation calmed down.</p> <p>In order to ease the fury of the townspeople and secure his control of Wissen Town, Yang Ling gave an order to execute someone pretending to Steve. With the aid of one of Harribell’s subordinates, the poor scapegoat managed to fool the spectators. Those who witnessed the execution from far away did not suspect a thing.</p> <p>Then, following Goode’s plan, Andrew and other important townsmen all invited Yang Ling to stay, willingly accepting his rule. Just like that, Yang Ling had naturally become the first real leader of Wissen Town.</p> <p>After a few days of preparations, the coronation ceremony for the leader began. There was no opulent parade or diplomats who came from far away. The simple townspeople gave Yang Ling their greatest blessings.</p> <p>Standing on the tallest point of Wissen Castle, looking at the hordes of people groveling on the ground, Yang Ling was overcome with emotion.</p> <p>A few months ago, he was still a downtrodden student who had just graduated. A few months ago, he was still walking along in the talent market. A few months ago, he was still addicted to games like Warcraft and Might and Magic. A few months ago…</p> <p>But today, he had land that he lorded over. A piece of resource-rich land that was larger than even China’s biggest city.</p> <p>Looking at the simple and pure townspeople, looking at the excited Alice, Argus, and the rest behind him, Yang Ling suddenly recalled a book on American society that he had read many years ago. After a moment’s deliberation, he decided to steal a few classic lines from the book.</p> <p>“In my hometown, there was once a great leader that said a few words like this.” After a pause, looking at the townspeople listening intently to him, Yang Ling continued, “In my land, it is my fault if there is a person who cannot feed his family despite toiling all day. In my land, it is my fault if a person is poor and destitute despite making an honest living. Under my command, it is my fault if a brave warrior suffers a heavy defeat even if they fought valiantly!”</p> <p>Silence, a field of silence, as if even the air had stopped moving!</p> <p>Looking at Yang Ling on the tower walls, the people remained motionless, allowing the snow to fall on them. All of their eyes were red, from the white-haired old men to the fierce hunters.</p> <p>Noble, this was a true noble!</p> <p>The people bowed sincerely on the ground. At this moment, they understood that they had not made the wrong choice. Only a great noble like Yang Ling was worth following with their lives!</p> <p>The townspeople were moved to tears, Alice, Goode, and the rest were no exception. No one noticed Harribell at the side, motionlessly observing Yang Ling as if deep in thought.</p> <p>“Wissen Town faces the continent’s largest Magical Beast forest. In the near future, we will assemble the most massive Magical Beast army in the continent to defend our sacred homeland. From today on, the land beneath our feet will be called Magical Beast Territory!” Yang Ling said as he summoned and mounted his Unicorn.</p> <p>Magical Beast Territory?</p> <p>Looking at the awe-inspiring Unicorn, thinking to Yang Ling’s massive Magical Beast army, the crowd broke into a commotion, cheering loudly. With a brilliant leader and a massive Magical Beast army, the days of being oppressed by various factions would never return.</p> <p>That night, the entire Wissen Town was bustling, and no one slept. The intoxicating fragrance of wine spread to every corner of the town, and the heartfelt laughter of the people spread into every wooden hut in Wissen Town.</p> <p>Under the intense flames, the young ladies broke into dances, all of them handing Yang Ling cups of warm alcohol. The brave warriors brawled with each other in the cold, the victors placing their right hands over their chests, bowing sincerely before Yang Ling.</p> <p>The Magical Beast Territory, the one and only Magical Beast Territory in the Tailun Continent, the Magical Beast Territory that would bring about shocking changes in the future was born just like that!</p>",
  "Chapter 110: Bandits": "<p>As Yang Ling looked at the bustling Wissen Town and watched the excited townspeople cheering loudly in the night, he was overcome with emotion.</p> <p>In the eyes of others, he was a great noble that was born into a noble family; he was a Summoner whose abilities were deep beyond comprehension. In this world, only he knew the truth!</p> <p>If not for the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda, he might still be sprawled in front of his second-hand computer playing World of Warcraft. If not for the mysterious Wizard Techniques, he might have been torn into pieces by the Magical Beasts in the forest. If not for his Magical Beast army, he might not even have been able to fill his stomach in this world, much less become a leader!</p> <p>The Wizard Techniques were the basis for his survival, the Magical Beasts were his means of development, and keeping a low profile was the smartest thing to do!</p> <p>Argus, Goode, and the rest were extremely excited, but they did not let the excitement overcome them.</p> <p>In this world where the strong preyed on the weak, flaunting their status without having sufficient abilities would just make them die sooner. Wissen Town was large, but compared to the massive empires around them, they were basically an ant beside an elephant. Their abilities were not worth mentioning.</p> <p>It was hard to build an empire, but it was harder to hold an empire! Furthermore, he merely had a small bit of influence. The best choice for him was to develop his abilities while keeping a low profile amongst the various empires eyeing him.</p> <p>Gaining control of Wissen Town was far from the mark of victory. It was still not time for him to lay back and enjoy himself; a new life was merely beginning!  ( B oxnovel.c om )</p> <p>Seeing the people walking about excitedly, Yang Ling had a thought. He turned around and instructed Argus to gather Murbaqi, Goode, and the rest to discuss the plans to come.</p> <p>Argus moved quickly. Soon, Yang Ling’s inner circle had rushed over. They all voiced their opinions after understanding Yang Ling’s intentions.</p> <p>“Sir, even though we have scattered the reinforcements of the Banto Empire and successfully seized control of Wissen Town, our strength is still far from sufficient. Not even talking about anything else, we will need an army of at least two thousand men to permanently defend the Aila Mountain Pass!” said Casey.</p> <p>After having returned rapidly from the Aila Mountain Pass, Casey was a little worried. After Yang Ling had removed his Magical Beast army, the defenses at the Aila Mountain Pass instantly became empty. The intentions of the Banto Empire were still unclear. If they sent a large army to launch a surprise attack, the eight hundred soldiers at the Aila Mountain Pass wouldn’t even be enough to put up a fight.</p> <p>“Impossible! As we are now, even maintaining an army of a thousand people is enough of a strain. How are we going to come up with enough crystal coins to hire a large number of soldiers once again?” the old butler Murbaqi opposed loudly.</p> <p>He had been troubled recently. He had needed to hire even more manpower after Wissen Castle became the leader’s abode, and the crystal coins had been flowing out like water. The accounts were very low. If they once again recruited a large number of soldiers, with their losses outweighing their profits as they were now, they might indeed become bankrupt someday.</p> <p>“Goode, what are your views?” Yang Ling’s expression did not change as he turned to look at Goode, who seemed to be deep in thought.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Goode said, “Sir, our daily expenses are indeed too high. We have to think of ways to develop and sell resources such as timber and minerals. The sooner the better!”</p> <p>“That’s right. Yang Ling, we have to develop the resources in Terras Forest as soon as possible. In that regard, the Boulade Merchant’s Association can provide you with a large amount of assistance and support!”</p> <p>Harribell agreed greatly with Goode’s suggestion. Terras Forest was rich in resources, and if she could monopolize the buying and selling of these resources, the Boulade Merchant’s Association she controlled would definitely be able to procure a huge amount of crystal coins. One low level Magical Beast Essence Crystal might only cost a hundred Purple Crystal Coins in Wissen Town, but it was worth at least a thousand Purple Crystal Coins when shipped back to the Alliance. Profit was guaranteed.</p> <p>Taking a sip of the jasmine tea Alice brought him, Yang Ling slipped into deep thought. At this point in time, he needed to recruit warriors to hold the Aila Mountain Pass, he needed to build a sturdy fortress, and he also needed to develop the various resources in Terras Forest. But without adequate manpower, all this was only empty talk.</p> <p>Startup capital was important in determining if an economy could be developed quickly, but a steady supply of cheap labor was also necessary. At the end of the 1980s, the economies of China’s coastal cities would never have developed so rapidly without the steady supply of cheap labor in the form of farmers who came from the north to work. If China hadn’t possessed a population surplus at the end of the twentieth century, their reforms would have been fraught with difficulties.</p> <p>“We need to do a large scale development of the resources in Terras Forest, and to do so we need a large number of crystal coins, but what we need more is a large amount of manpower!” After a pause, Yang Ling continued, “Without enough manpower, who’s going to excavate the mines for us? Without enough manpower, who’s going to hunt and gather wood for us?”</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, the people all agreed with Yang Ling’s point. Without enough manpower, there was no way that they could develop the resources in Terras Forest on a large scale. But Wissen Town was far away and remote. How were they going to get a large number of young, strong people in such a short span of time?</p> <p>“Even though Wissen Town is rich in resources, it’s quite remote. Furthermore, the route here is laced with aboriginal tribes that are like bandits. Who would be willing to spend that much effort traversing the mountains to live here if they didn’t have to?”</p> <p>After shaking his head, Goode sighed in frustration, inviting the agreement of everyone else. Wissen Town was originally a wasteland, with only a ridiculously large ancient castle. It only slowly became a small town when vagrants trying to avoid natural disasters fled into the area. Without a large scale war or natural disaster, who would willingly travel the distance to live here?</p> <p>The group was dejected, unable to find a solution, but Yang Ling had a thought after hearing Goode’s unintentional reminder. He came up with an idea to kill three birds with one stone.</p> <p>Whether a person was traveling to Wissen from the Banto Empire or the Livenza Alliance, the roads were plagued by aboriginal tribes. Many of these aborigines were cruel by nature and made their living by robbing others. The chaotic situation had severely threatened the merchant teams attempting to make their way through the area. This was also one of the reasons why Wissen Town hadn’t been developed, despite the rich resources.</p> <p>Destroying the aboriginal nests would not only clear the threat for the merchant teams and boost the development of Wissen Town, it would also allow them to obtain a large number of slaves as workers. Perhaps he might even be able to search out a decent amount of crystal coins or specialty items that were worth some money. It was three birds with one stone.</p> <p>No matter how you looked at it, sending his troops to clear the bandit-like aboriginal tribes from the roads was definitely something worth doing. Given his current lack of manpower, Yang Ling would definitely not pass up this opportunity.</p>",
  "Chapter 111: Ladak Mountain Range": "<p>Harribell wanted to develop the crystal mine that Renaya had promised as soon as possible in order to ensure that she could obtain the most benefits from Wissen Town. After a series of secret discussions with Yang Ling, she left in a hurry. She wanted to return to the Livenza Alliance to begin her preparations early.</p> <p>She had to send men to the Rossi Empire to look for Renaya to carry out the agreement, and she also had to send men to the Banto Empire to alleviate the conflict between the Banto Empire and Wissen Town. All of her efforts would be wasted if the Banto Empire sent a large army to attack Wissen Town.</p> <p>According to the preliminary agreement, the Boulade Merchant’s Association would give full support to the development of Wissen Town. They would supply the necessary manpower and various resources. As their reward, the Boulade Merchant’s Association would have priority in purchasing the resources from Wissen Town, such as timber, minerals, and Essence Crystals.</p> <p>Also, the Boulade Merchant’s Association would build a large scale port on the southern coast near Wissen Town. After the construction was complete, they would receive half the profits of the port.</p> <p>Building a large port might not bring in any profit in the short term, and the merchant association might even suffer a loss. In the long term, however, Wissen Town’s rich resources, would draw in a never-ending stream of merchant teams as long as the trade routes were open. They would definitely make a profit.</p> <p>Harribell would definitely make a profit, while Yang Ling would not suffer a loss either. At the current moment, Wissen Town was basically a blank slate. With the support of the Boulade Merchant’s Association, they would be able to develop the town rapidly. The agreement with Harribell was a win-win. Everyone was happy.</p> <p>The Boulade Merchant’s Association had vast influence, but Yang Ling was not willing to depend completely on someone else for aid. Developing his own influence and securing his control over Wissen Town was the smartest thing he could do.</p> <p>After the situation was stabilized, Yang Ling decisively ordered his team of personal guards to be expanded to two hundred men. A hundred barbarians and a hundred elf archers, with Argus as their leader, followed Yang Ling to deal with the insurgents.</p> <p>Casey led eight hundred warriors and guarded the Aila Mountain Pass, and he was responsible for the construction of the fortress. Goode led the rest of the warriors to defend Wissen Town, responsible for maintaining order amongst the steadily increasing population. He was also responsible for the search for resources and the gathering of intelligence. The responsibility of rebuilding of the winery, dwarf weapon shop, and the day to day operations of the Shangri-La inn were all handed over to the old butler Murbaqi.</p> <p>Two days previous, Goode had brought many gifts to the elf, dwarf, and barbarian tribes, and he had gathered a hundred and fifty elves, a hundred dwarves, and two hundred barbarians. He had also selected three hundred and fifty hunters in town, gathering a total of eight hundred guards. Even though the numbers were not large, they were more than enough to act as a deterrent to the average adventurer.</p> <p>After the preparations were complete, Yang Ling set off with his personal guards. According to intelligence from Parrot, there were countless aboriginal tribes scattered near the Ladak Mountain Range. There were filthy Gnomes, bloodthirsty Ogres, ferocious Beastmen… There were countless tribes.</p> <p>Exterminating the aborigines near the Ladak Mountain Range would basically eliminate the threat of bandits to the Aila Mountain Pass. Then, Yang Ling could concentrate his firepower on dealing with the aborigines outside of the Aila Mountain Pass.</p> <p>The Ladak Mountain Range was made up of many mountains, each one taller than the next. The main path in the mountain range had countless twists and turns. No one was sure how many mountains there were, nor were they sure of exactly how many aborigines lived in them.</p> <p>Every winter, the hungry aborigines would engage in battle with one another, and the merchant teams along the way would often bear the brunt of the violence. That was also why every merchant team heading toward Wissen Town had no choice but to recruit a large team of guards, severely impacting the profits and enthusiasm of the merchants, which influenced the development of Wissen Town by extension.</p> <p>In order to avoid alarming the aborigines, Yang Ling and his group disguised themselves as a small, slow-moving merchant team. A few dozen light carriages were lined up single file, and thirty of his men disguised themselves as servants while twenty were dressed as guards. The rest of the personal guards were hidden within the carriages.</p> <p>From far away, the slow speed of the carriages and the deep imprints on the ground all indicated that the carriages were packed to the brim with goods. But in actuality, other than a few barrels of rum, the carriages were filled with bags of heavy sand.</p> <p>With the intoxicating fragrance of wine spreading with the wind, Yang Ling believed that the full cargo and the minimal guard would definitely serve as a fatal temptation for the hungry aborigines.</p> <p>Indeed, he hadn’t journeyed far from Wissen Town when the Horned Bee Beasts surrounding the perimeter of the merchant team alerted him that someone was taking the bait. A group of simply dressed Gnomes were silently surrounding them, as if prepared to take the merchant team in one fell swoop.</p> <p>Sitting cross legged in the carriage, Yang Ling closed his eyes to rest. Many foreign images appeared in his brain. The speedy Horned Bee Beasts were like high speed cameras, sending him images of what was happening around him in real time.</p> <p>With the advances in his Wizard Power, Yang Ling had noticed that the images the Horned Bee Beasts were sending to him were getting clearer and clearer. Their effective range had also increased. If he had been receiving a hazy black and white picture at the start, what he saw now was a color picture from a digital television. The picture was getting clearer the nearer they were to the target.</p> <p>Eight hundred meters, seven hundred meters, six hundred meters, five hundred and fifty meters… The sieging Gnomes were getting closer and closer, and the images relayed to him through the Horned Bee Beasts were also getting increasingly clearer.</p> <p>The Gnomes were an ancient race, and they were only about half as tall as an average human. It was said that they were the cousins of the Pygmies, while others claimed that they shared an ancestor with the Dwarves, but the dirty-looking Gnomes had never acknowledged either of those claims.</p> <p>It was rumored that they had been the masters of the Tailun Continent a few thousand years ago, and that they had possessed a majestic history and civilization. Perhaps due to that, each Gnome had an indescribable allure that was as characteristic of them as their cowardly nature and dirty appearance.</p> <p>Yang Ling had once heard a joke in Wissen Town.</p> <p>A hungry Gnome had broken into a person’s house and gone into the kitchen. He took a bag full of food with him after eating his fill. After he was captured and found himself facing the owner’s fury, he defended himself by saying that he had taken the food instead of stolen the food. He would never admit that he had stolen something, even if someone tried to beat the admission out of him.</p> <p>Unlike the physically powerful Dwarves, the Gnomes were short and weak, and coupled with their lack of magic, it made them as cowardly as mice. In the human empire, the word “Gnome” was basically a synonym for “trash.” A lady would often call a man a “useless gnome” when she was chiding him.</p> <p>It was easy to imagine how people thought of the Gnomes!</p> <p>The Gnomes were cowardly in nature, but they would sometimes act recklessly when they were in a large group, taking huge risks based on their numbers advantage. The group attacking them was no exception. There were old gnomes with white beards and bubbly kids mixed in with the group. An initial count revealed that there were around eight hundred of them.</p> <p>There are robbers like this in this world?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head after examining the Gnomes. These simply dressed Gnomes did not have matching armor or a bright flag. They were completely unaware of the Horned Bee Beasts behind them. If Yang Ling planned the ambush well, he believed that a wave of the barbarians’ attacks would be enough to exterminate the Gnomes.</p> <p>“Sir, the attacking Gnomes are getting nearer to us. Are we going to attack immediately?” Argus was disguised as a caravan guard, and after receiving a report from his scout, he was itching to engage the enemies that were approaching them.</p> <p>“Don’t be too anxious. We’ll guide them closer, then attack with all of our men, taking them in one fell swoop!” Yang Ling continued after a pause, “Order the scouts to stay on alert around us as a precaution for any other ambushes from the enemy!”</p> <p>Even though the Horned Bee Beasts were continuously feeding him data on the situation, Yang Ling did not dare be careless. There was always the chance that he might miss enemies that were lying in ambush. Even though the Ladak Mountain Range was some distance away from the Terras Forest, there were still frequent sightings of Magical Beasts. It was best to be careful.</p> <p>At Argus’s command, the people pretended to be oblivious to what was going on and continued walking forward. Some of the barbarians even intentionally took out their wine flasks and took a few long drinks. The intoxicating fragrance of wine, the inattentive guards, the full cargo… The attacking Gnomes were all tempted.</p> <p>After closing to within two hundred meters of Yang Ling, the Gnomes suddenly stopped and settled behind rocks or shrubs on both sides of the road. Soon, a few Gnomes holding staffs started to let out a quiet murmur. A strange ripple slowly appeared in the air.</p> <p>Spellcasters?</p> <p>As he watched them through the Horned Bee Beasts, Yang Ling was shocked. The Gnomes had never possessed magic, and there were no records of any Gnome Spellcasters in history. Could the sun have risen from the west today?</p> <p>In his shock, Yang Ling did not dare wait around. He immediately ordered all of his men to attack and quickly summoned his Magical Beast army. While conquering the tribes could benefit him greatly, it would not be worth it if he had to exhaust eight hundred of his men to kill a thousand of them.</p> <p>After receiving the order, the army quickly charged out from the carriages. The barbarians lifted their tire-sized axes and charged fiercely forward. The elves were even quicker, their arrows fast as a river current, quickly dispatching of the Gnomes in front of them.</p> <p>“Not good, an ambush!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, quick, charge forward and finish off their archers!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing the barbarians and elves suddenly charging out from the carriages, the attacking Gnomes lost their color in shock. They split into two groups under the instructions of an elder, with one group tasked to block the attacking barbarians and the other to charge toward the elves by the side of the carriages. At the same time, seeing the dire situation, the Gnome Spellcasters wielding staffs sped up their incantations nervously.</p> <p>With the murmurs of the Gnome Spellcasters, the ripple of Magical Energy in the air became more prominent. Just as Yang Ling was about to instruct his Magical Beast army to pounce forward, he saw the small group of Gnome Spellcasters raise their hands at the same time. A huge wave of fireballs appeared in the sky.</p> <p>Sky of Fireballs?</p> <p>Looking at the fireballs dancing in the sky, Yang Ling once again suffered a huge shock. He recalled the terrifying Nine-headed Snake Monster and the powerful fire element magic. Getting onto his Unicorn in shock, he ordered the barbarians and elves to retreat quickly, then instructed the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles to make their way around the area before pouncing forward.</p>",
  "Chapter 112: The Secret of the Gnomes": "<p>At Yang Ling’s command, the barbarians and elves retreated quickly. But there were still a number of people who were hit by the rain of fireballs, and their hair and eyebrows were quickly singed.</p> <p>Yang Ling’s personal guards had retreated, but the Magical Beast army displayed their might. The Gnomes that were charging toward him were eliminated by the Evil Eye and spider armies, while the rest were targeted by the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles.</p> <p>Without sturdy armor and sharp arrows, the Gnomes were unable to defend themselves against the speedy Horned Bee Beasts. The ground became littered with numb Gnomes after they were shot by a rain of poisonous stingers.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts displayed their might, but the Gargoyles did not disappoint Yang Ling either. After descending from the sky, they either smashed the heads of the Gnomes or picked up the Gnomes like eagles, tearing their prey in two in the air.</p> <p>Caught off guard, the Gnomes fell into chaos. Some of them ran in all directions, wishing that they had two more legs. Some had dazed expressions, motionless as if scared silly. Some clenched their teeth and tried to retaliate, flailing the weapons in their hands to no avail. They were torn to shreds by the swooping Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles.</p> <p>Under the protection of their clansmen, the Gnome Spellcasters launched a quick counterattack. Unlike last time, they now split up and acted individually, shooting out fireballs in an instant without having to recite an incantation. The fireballs weren’t powerful but they were fast, and a string of fireballs instantly appeared.</p> <p>The Gnome Spellcasters tried their best to fight back, but unfortunately, both the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles were as fast as lightning. They were able to easily avoid the fireballs by stopping abruptly or moving their tails before a new wave of attacks could be thrown at them.</p> <p>( B oxnovel.c om )   Faced with the unavoidable attacks of the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles, the Gnomes soon lost their will to fight, each one of them running away faster than the last.</p> <p>But they soon realized that it didn’t matter. The faster they ran from the speedy Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles, the faster they met their end.</p> <p>White brain matter, fresh red blood, twitching corpses…</p> <p>Looking at the demon-like enemy, the Gnomes that were lucky enough to survive completely broke down! All of them wisely stopped in their tracks and surrendered, and even the few strange Spellcasters were no exception.</p> <p>A count at the end of the battle showed that only about five hundred of the Gnomes were left from the original eight hundred. They had suffered heavy casualties in such a short amount of time. If not for Yang Ling giving the timely order, the attacking Gnomes might have been exterminated in just an hour, all of them falling to the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles.</p> <p>“Sir, spare us, spare us!” Looking at Yang Ling on his Unicorn, the elf elder knelt on the ground and pleaded for his life, incredibly regretful. He wanted to slap himself so badly.</p> <p>If he had known that this was a trap, if he had known that the caravan possessed this many terrifying Magical beasts, if he had led his clansmen in a timely retreat, if… How could his clansmen end up like this?</p> <p>If he had known that it would end like this, he would not have been willing to step into Yang Ling’s trap even if he had to starve to death. Yang Ling’s abilities were too terrifying. Hordes of flying Magical Beasts that blanketed the sky, bloodthirsty warriors, and those frightening Evil Eye and spider armies…</p> <p>Over the past decades, whenever they found it hard to bear with their hunger, the Gnome Elder had launched surprise attacks on heavily guarded merchant teams, ferocious Ogres, and even a large group of Wind Wolves with his clansmen. But he had never seen such a terrifying Magical Beast army. He had never seen Magical Beasts that could launch such a coordinated attack!</p> <p>“I am the leader of Wissen Town. If you can tell me what use you have and serve under me, I might be able to spare your lives. Otherwise, you can either hand over a ransom to atone for your sins, or else…!”</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head as he looked at the short and weak Gnomes. With their height and strength, they might not even make the cut as farmers, much less as miners or lumberjacks. Other than the few strange Spellcasters, the rest of them were not much better than trash.</p> <p>The leader of Wissen Town?</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, the Gnome Elder Omir swallowed with difficulty. He would never have expected to be this unlucky, falling for a trap of the so-called Lord of Magical Beasts in Wissen Town.</p> <p>Recently, the name of the leader of Wissen Town had spread all around the Ladak Mountains. Almost all of the tribes now knew that there was a leader in Wissen Town that they could not afford to mess with.</p> <p>A leader who had scattered a Banto army, who could summon a large group of Magical Beasts to do battle, who killed without batting an eyelid… The news that came from Wissen Town swept over the entire Ladak Mountain Range like a cold wind. Even the powerful Ogres and numerous Beastmen were fearful, much less the weak races like the Gnomes.</p> <p>( B oxnovel.c om )   As he looked at Yang Ling high above, the Gnome Elder had a thought and pleaded loudly, “Sir Leader, we can help you make practical tools! Please take us in!”</p> <p>Even though he had suffered a heavy loss in this attack, if he could seize the opportunity and join Wissen Town and serve the leader, then it might be a blessing in disguise for the Gnomes. It was better than having to starve and brave the cold every day.</p> <p>“Sir, we only need a few rations every day. Please take us in!”</p> <p>“Sir, we can climb trees and pick wild fruits! We can dive into the rivers to catch fish…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Following their elder’s lead, the Gnomes started to plead loudly. They no longer had any food left in the clan, and if they did not manage to snatch any edible food from passing merchants or nearby tribes, their entire clan might starve to death. At this point, they were no longer thinking of Yang Ling as a demon who came from hell, but an angel who came from amongst the clouds.</p> <p>Pick fruits the trees and catch fish from ponds?</p> <p>Looking at the Gnomes and their skinny limbs, Yang Ling shook his head. He needed a large number of workers that were as strong as oxen, and not a bunch of trash who would only waste his supplies.</p> <p>“I am a little curious, how did you launch the fireballs?” Yang Ling said coldly after a pause. “Tell me truthfully and I can still consider. Otherwise…”</p> <p>“This…”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling ask about their greatest secret, the Gnome Elder started to hesitate. This secret had been passed down in their tribe for centuries. Without this secret, their clan might have been exterminated by the ferocious Ogres and Beastmen near them.</p> <p>Seeing the elder’s hesitation, Yang Ling shot a look to Argus. Argus understood and led the barbarians to walk slowly toward the Gnomes. Their raging bloodlust and the cold gleam of the giant axes immediately brought the hesitating Gnome Elder to his senses.</p> <p>Faced with the barbarians pressing forward one step at a time and the massive Magical Beast army, the Gnome Elder Omir understood that he had no other choice left. If he did not explain himself, there might not be a single member of his clan who could leave this place. He began explaining himself slowly.</p> <p>The Gnomes, as a race, were not fated with magic, and they could not cultivate Battle Energy. But their limbs were incredibly nimble, and their ancestors had passed down a great deal of weird knowledge and many techniques.</p> <p>According to their historical records, they could heat up a crystal until it became a glass of liquid, and even turn it into a ball of steam. They could send spring water from low ground to higher ground using a windmill and a few stems of bamboo in the air…</p> <p>A few hundred years ago, a Gnome by the name of Hallard had traveled out of the tribe and encountered a powerful Magical Tutor. After serving the Magical Tutor for many years, he gained a strong understanding of the principles of magic and spell formations, despite still being unable to use magic. In his elder years, he unintentionally discovered an alarming secret.</p> <p>Hallard realized that he could release the natural magical spells of Magical Beasts without the use of Magical Energy if he drew a specific spell formation using the fresh Blood Essence of the Magical Beast. For example, after drawing the Wind Dagger Spell Formation using the fresh blood of a Wind Wolf, he could instantly release a low level Wind Dagger. If he used the fresh blood of an Earth Bear to draw an earth element spell formation, he could instantly cast a low level Earth Spike, and so on.</p> <p>The greater the Magical Beasts, the more powerful the spell formation became. If the person using this method had enough Magical Energy and knew the corresponding incantation, they could even instantly cast high level spells. It was very powerful.</p> <p>After repeated testing, Hallard realized that he could draw the magical spell formation on crystal ores and Magical Beast Essence Crystals. These formations could even be drawn on the caster’s skin. They could use it as a surprise attack at the critical moment to catch their opponents off guard!</p> <p>They’re using the fresh blood of Magical Beasts to draw magical spell formations?</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, Yang Ling recalled the Wizard Amulets in his ring. They were both made of the fresh blood of Magical Beasts, and they both required no incantations to activate.</p> <p>Could the Wizard Amulets be a special kind of magical spell formation?</p> <p>In his doubt, Yang Ling carefully observed the fire element magical spell formation on the back of one of the Gnome Spellcasters.</p> <p>Twisted lines, strange pathways, unexplainable ripples… The mysterious magical spell formations indeed shared similarities with the Wizard Amulets. At first glance, they seemed to be larger Wizard Amulets. But they felt a little different after Yang Ling had observed them closely for some time.</p> <p>A powerful person, and not just any powerful person!</p> <p>After understanding what was going on, Yang Ling felt awe toward the Gnome called Hallard. Without exceptional talent, nimble hands, vast knowledge, and exceptional patience, one could never have discovered such a wonder. Now, he finally believed a little that the Gnomes had once had an illustrious civilization and history.</p> <p>Yang Ling could not help but imagine the various uses for these magical spell formations. If he could draw various magical spell formations at a large scale and set up an army that could instantly cast magic spells of various elements, its battle abilities would be unparalleled.</p> <p>What would happen if he drew the magical spell formations on the bodies of Magical Beasts like the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes?</p> <p>Yang Ling had a thought when he looked at the Magical Beast army around him. He came up with a maniacal idea.</p>",
  "Chapter 113: Employing a Foreign Troop Team": "<p>In the hope of setting up a magical army, Yang Ling followed the Gnome Elder to their tribe, prepared to gain a further understanding of the mysteries surrounding the spell formations.</p> <p>As long as there was an army that could use magic to both attack and defend stationed at the Aila Mountain Pass, the fortress there would be impregnable. The Banto soldiers might not even be able to invade Wissen Town with an army of a hundred thousand, much less ten thousand. This way, he could obtain valuable time for developing Wissen Town.</p> <p>The newly created Magical Beast Territory required a large amount of manpower, crystal coins, and resources. But even more importantly, they needed a certain amount of time to develop.</p> <p>The outcome would be disastrous if they suffered the harassment of a large group of bandits or the attacks of the Banto Empire while they were in the early stages of development. Their circumstances would be dire.</p> <p>For that reason, Yang Ling had saved Steve at the critical moment and forced him to assist in alleviating the conflict between Wissen Town and the Banto Empire. It was also for that reason that he had come to eliminate the bandit tribes despite just having gained control of the situation in Wissen Town. He wanted to obtain the largest amount of labor in the shortest amount of time to quickly develop the influence of Wissen Town.</p> <p>The Gnome tribe was situated in an obscure valley. They had to take a boat across a culvert with waters several meters deep after getting past a sinister cave to reach their main base. It was definitely a strategic location. This might have been the reason that the Gnomes were able to proliferate in this forest where the strong preyed on the weak even without powerful physical abilities or being adept in magic.</p> <p>The cave at the entrance was sinister and dark, but the valley behind the culvert seemed to be a paradise not of this world. It was covered with berry trees. The Gnomes would be able to harvest a large amount of berries when spring came next year. Unfortunately, the Gnomes no longer had any rations left. If they did not manage to find any food, none of the members of the tribe would be able to last until next spring.</p> <p>Yang Ling was shocked when he saw the paradise-like main camp of the Gnomes. After taking a few turns, he was even more dazed when he saw the rows of exquisite wooden huts, windmills turning slowly in the wind, and the spring water being drawn toward the camp from the mountains.</p> <p>Perhaps because they were working all the time, many of the Gnomes were covered in mud. They looked filthy, especially with their unique green skin. But no one doubted that they had a pair of nimble hands after looking at the exquisite huts and spinning windmills. It looked like the stories of the Gnomes once having an illustrious civilization weren’t just baseless rumors.</p> <p>“Sir, please!”</p> <p>After leading Yang Ling and Argus to the largest wooden hut, the Gnome Elder instructed his clansmen to gather a few dry berries, just enough to give one for every person.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling observe the berries, the Gnome Elder let out an awkward smile. At the same time, the few Gnomes outside the windows could only swallow with difficulty, their eyes locked on the berries in their hands. It looked like the Gnome tribe was truly having difficult times.</p> <p>After handing the berries to the young Gnomes outside the window, Yang Ling smiled as he rubbed their bald heads. Looking at their large heads, small bodies, and huge round eyes, he could not help but remember Shin Chan from the comic books.</p> <p>“Sir, let us join Wissen Town and work for you. We won’t give you any trouble, and we’ll do our best if we are given something to eat. No matter what, we won’t be a burden to you!”</p> <p>Looking at the excited Gnomes outside the window taking turns eating the berries, the Gnome Elder once again repeated his request. If he did not find any rations soon, many of his clansmen might not even make it through the week, much less the winter.</p> <p>“How many of you are there?” Yang Ling showed no emotion. He still had a number of rations left in Wissen Town, but that did not mean that he could waste them as he wished.</p> <p>“Counting the elderly and the children, a total of…” Looking at the expressionless Yang Ling, the Gnome Elder clenched his teeth. “A total of about two thousand five hundred people.”</p> <p>Two thousand five hundred people?</p> <p>Looking at the slightly blushing Gnome Elder and confirming that he hadn’t misheard, Yang Ling shook his head. He had not expected such a small tribe to hold two thousand five hundred people.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s silence, the Gnome Elder nervously gave an explanation.</p> <p>It turned out that unlike an average human, Gnomes usually lived to be about a hundred and fifty years old, and thus, there would be a good number of elderly in a Gnome Tribe. The more ancient the tribe, the more elderly there were. Omir’s tribe already had thousands of years of history and was naturally not an exception. They had about three hundred elderly who were unable to work.</p> <p>Furthermore, there had been a large group of Gnomes wandering through the area half a year ago, all of them famished. The elder had sent men to bring them in after understanding their plight, combining their two tribes into one. Their population suddenly increased by roughly a thousand. That was also the reason why the rations that they had prepared for the winter were in such a severe deficit.</p> <p>“Let’s do this: I’ll send someone to get you a few carts of rations to deal with your emergency. Then I’ll think about what to do after you’ve finished the rations!”</p> <p>After understanding what was going on, Yang Ling avoided directly addressing the Gnome Elder’s request to join Wissen Town. He wanted to make the decision after learning more about the spell formations. After all, two thousand five hundred people was not a small amount. Wissen Town would welcome two thousand five hundred warriors or workers, but it would definitely not want two thousand five hundred useless mouths to feed.</p> <p>The Gnome Elder was perceptive. Seeing that Yang Ling was avoiding talking about his request, he actively started explaining the spell formations that were drawn using the Blood Essence of Magical Beasts. He had to give more if he wanted a greater reward. Having a few carts of rations was good enough. If they used the rations sparingly, they might sustain his clansmen for half a month.</p> <p>The greater the hopes, the greater the disappointment!</p> <p>After learning more about the mysteries of the Gnomes’ spell formations, Yang Ling understood that it was not as simple as he had imagined.</p> <p>First, the blood of the Magical Beasts had to be fresh. The fresh blood of Magical Beasts would frequently lose its effectiveness after being exposed to air for more than an hour. Thus, it was not suitable for him to draw complicated spell formations.</p> <p>Second, there was also a requirement for the medium the spell formation was drawn on. Not any person or rock could meet this requirement. For example, the effect would be the best if they drew a wind element spell using a Wind Wolf’s blood on its own Essence Crystal; it would be less effective when drawn on crystals without enough energy, and even worse when drawn on a person without enough Magical Energy.</p> <p>Finally, the process of drawing the spell formations was complicated, and the rate of failure was incredibly high. Even the tribe’s most experienced Gnome Elder Omir could only succeed once every ten times. Sometimes, if they were not careful enough, they could even cause explosions. The higher the level of the Magical Beasts, the more powerful the explosions were.</p> <p>After causing five explosions in a row and almost burning off his eyebrows, Yang Ling gave up in frustration. These spell formations drawn using the Blood Essence of Magical Beasts might seem similar to the Wizard Amulets on the surface, but they required a lot of effort to draw.</p> <p>“Omir, how many people in your tribe can draw these magical spells?”</p> <p>Yang Ling did not give up after his multiple failures. If there were enough people who could draw spell formations in batches, quickly building up a magical army might still be possible.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling staring at him, the Gnome Elder understood what Yang Ling was thinking. He hesitated for a long while before saying awkwardly, “There are only five currently, but… If we have some time, we can add a few more apprentices!”</p> <p>Only five?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head and let out a bitter laugh. Five people might not produce more than a few spell formations a day, even if they worked from morning until night. He would have to wait ages to set up a team of a few dozen men, much less a magical army that could be used for both offense and defense.</p> <p>It was no wonder that there were so few Spellcasters among this many Gnomes. It was also no wonder that the Gnomes were still starving at the bottom of the pecking order even though they had such a powerful ability!</p> <p>Should I take a few Gnomes back as workers and let the rest die off on their own?</p> <p>Yang Ling deliberated silently as he looked at the nervous Gnome Elder. It was clear that directly moving all two and a half thousand Gnomes back to Wissen Town was a losing transaction for him.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s expression, the Gnome Elder pleaded nervously, “Sir, other than drawing spell formations, we can also make various practical tools. We can even send brave warriors to do battle for you!”</p> <p>Faced with the snow-covered land, his hungry clansmen would definitely die if they did not have enough rations. At this point, Yang Ling was their only hope. If they missed such a rare opportunity, his clansmen might have no choice but to wait for their end.</p> <p>Send warriors to do battle for me?</p> <p>Looking at the skinny frame of the nervous elder and recalling the Gnomes’ chaotic battle formation and brittle defense, Yang Ling once again shook his head and let out a mirthless smile. If Wissen Town had to depend on such an army for battle one day, it might truly be on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>“Sir, you have to save us. Sir…” Seeing Yang Ling shake his head once again, the Gnome Elder led his clansmen and knelt on the floor without hesitation.</p> <p>Following the elder’s lead, the Gnomes all knelt. Some of the white-haired elderly and ladies wept. Everyone understood that no one would be able to last through this long, cold winter without Yang Ling’s help.</p> <p>“Sir, we still have a considerable amount of rations in the castle. Are we going to…” The tiny Gnomes knelt on the ground, their faces dripping tears and reddened from the cold. Argus, who was normally a man of few words, could not help but plead for them.</p> <p>Originally, Argus had wanted to say more, but he had no choice but to close his mouth when he saw the emotionless Yang Ling and the hordes of Gnomes on the ground. It would have been fine if there were only a few dozen Gnomes, but two thousand five hundred Gnomes was too many.</p> <p>“Since bandits have severely harassed the merchant teams passing by and impacted the development of Wissen Town, I have no choice but to clear this area of any tribes that made a living by robbing others!” Looking at the Gnomes listening intently to him, Yang Ling continued, “If you are not afraid of hardships or death, you can join my army. Serve me and obtain the rewards you deserve!”</p> <p>Yang Ling had an idea when he saw the horde of Gnomes on the snow-covered floor.</p> <p>While the Gnomes lacked firepower, they had the numbers advantage and were familiar with the terrain of the Ladak Mountain Range. Creating a foreign troop team and using them to gather information and distract enemies would allow him to clear out the nearby aboriginal tribes much more quickly.</p> <p>Spell formations that could instantly cast magical spells, exquisite craftsmanship, and a group of Gnome soldiers…</p> <p>Yang Ling knew that he had to hand over a shipment of rations in exchange for accepting this group of Gnomes, but it would definitely be worthwhile in the short term. In the long run, it might even be a decent transaction.</p>",

  "Chapter 115: Ogres": "<p>Since it was difficult to draw the spell formations of the Gnomes, Yang Ling was unable to quickly build the magical army that he wanted. He decided to focus his efforts on clearing the Ladak Mountain Range. He was going to analyze the spell formations slowly after obtaining what he needed to begin developing Wissen Town.</p> <p>With the Gnomes leading the way, Yang Ling no longer had to pretend to be a merchant team as bait. He ordered his army to make their way straight to the nearest aboriginal tribe.</p> <p>The Gnome army was taking shape after undergoing preliminary training and eliminating those with inadequate physical abilities. Even though they were far from the elite barbarians and elf archers, they were at least better than they had been. They would not charge forward in a disorganized mess at every situation they encountered.</p> <p>“Sir, in front of us is the Ogre tribe!” The Gnome Elder was a little hesitant after making his way past a short shrub. “The Ogres have thick hides and muscles, and their strength is immense. Are you sure that you want to attack their old nest?”</p> <p>Even though he knew that Yang Ling was powerful, the Gnome Elder was still fearful when he recalled how terrifying the Ogres were. The Ogres were naturally cruel and merciless, and their tribe was one of the more notorious amongst the nearby tribes. Unless he was left with no choice, he would never willingly go into battle with such a powerful race.</p> <p>“Hehe, relax! In front of my Magical Beast army, the Ogres won’t be able to withstand a blow!” Seeing the Gnomes getting more and more nervous as they approached the Ogre tribe, Yang Ling summoned his Unicorn to boost their morale.</p> <p>Even though the battle abilities of the Gnomes were insufficient, they had the numbers advantage. Coupled with their handful of Spellcasters, they were a decent force if commanded well. At the very least, they could be used to attract the attention of the enemy.</p> <p>Obtaining the greatest amount of benefit for the lowest cost, that was the smartest thing to do!</p> <p>Even though he was confident that he could charge in with his Magical Beast army alone, Yang Ling did not wish to severely damage his forces just to kill his enemies. Using the Gnomes and his personal guards to attract the attention of the enemies before summoning his Magical Beast army for a surprise attack was the best plan. Of course, it would be even more ideal if he could command his Magical Beast army to set up an ambush and lead the enemy into the radius of his attacks.</p> <p>A lightning fast battle was the best choice when it came to surprise attacks!</p> <p>He was definitely unwilling to engage in positional warfare with his powerful enemies. He had spent a considerable amount of effort on every one of his Magical Beasts, and he would not allow a large number of deaths or injuries. Even though he could tame more low level Magical Beasts like the Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts to replenish their numbers, it wasn’t easy to evolve them from level one to level three, or even higher.</p> <p>Other than that, in front of absolute power, numbers and schemes were completely meaningless!</p> <p>After the situation in Wissen Town stabilized, Yang Ling hoped to spend all of his effort in taming high level Magical Beasts. It was enough to have around two thousand of each low level Magical Beast like the Horned Bee Beasts, Evil Eyes, and spiders. What he needed now was two thousand powerful units such as the Withered Tree Warriors. Of course, it would be even more perfect if he had two thousand high level Magical Beasts like the Unicorn.</p> <p>The Ogres were relatively ignorant creatures. They had boundless strength, but their intelligence was limited. They could split tigers in two with their bare hands, but they were often unable to deal with the parasites living on their bodies. In order to deal with the worms that were the size of grains of rice, they would often scratch themselves with hard rocks until they bled all over.</p> <p>They enjoyed feasting on the blood of Magical Beasts or humans, and they liked devouring the fresh brain matter of their prey. They were barbaric and merciless. To some extent, they could be called a human-shaped Magical Beast. Not even ferocious wild beasts dared live near them, much less weaker races like the Gnomes.</p> <p>Unlike the hidden nest of the Gnomes, the nest of the Ogres was made up of massive caves. Other than a few distracted scouts, most of the Ogres were all inside the caves, hiding from the icy wind.</p> <p>Perhaps they thought they were too powerful for anyone to dare offending them, or maybe they had loosened their guard due to the cold. Either way, the Ogre tribe was basically unguarded. They were completely oblivious to the disaster that was about to befall them.</p> <p>After sending a team of Horned Bee Beasts to silently kill off the patrolling Ogres, Yang Ling instructed his army to hide in the low lying shrubs by the small hill overlooking the Ogre tribe. From the shrubs, the entrance of the cave was right within range of the Evil Eyes. Yang Ling believed that not one of the Ogres would be able to escape from his grasp if he managed to hold against their attacks.</p> <p>According to the information from the Gnomes, there were at least five hundred Ogres in this tribe. If they were lucky, he might be able to capture two or three hundred Ogres to be his laborers. With their three-meter-tall frames and abundant stamina, they were definitely the best candidates for mining and logging.</p> <p>As Yang Ling’s most powerful unit for close combat at the current time, the Withered Tree Warriors moved to the forefront and turned into shrubs. Their rich leaves covered the horde of Evil Eyes behind them. Beside the Evil Eyes were the powerful barbarians and accurate elf archers. Their main mission was to work with the Withered Tree Warriors to defend the Evil Eye army.</p> <p>As the troops most effective for an ambush, the spider army dug into the ground on both sides of the hill. They were responsible for surrounding the Ogres that charged toward them and alleviating the pressure on the Withered Tree Warriors, barbarians, and elf archers.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles were speedy, their attacks sharp. However, their main responsibility was not to attack the sieging Ogres. Instead, they were to wait until the Ogre elites had rushed out of the cave before launching a fast surprise attack on their cave, as a precaution against the Ogres returning to their cave and putting up a strong defense.</p> <p>The nervous Gnome army was to be used as bait, responsible for attracting a large group of Ogres toward Yang Ling. Yang Ling was not counting on them to kill any Ogres. They would have accomplished their mission if they could successfully attract the Ogre elites toward him.</p> <p>After the making necessary preparations and looking at the Gnome Elder who was forcefully collecting himself, Yang Ling ordered a team of Horned Bee Beasts to hide amongst them after a moment’s deliberation. It served to give them a little courage and confidence, and it was also a precaution against them suffering heavy casualties in a short amount of time. After all, he still had to rely on these Gnomes in his research on spell formations in the future. It would be alright if he lost one or two, but it would not be worth it if he lost of lot of them so quickly.</p> <p>“Elder, I’ll send a team of Horned Bee Beasts to protect you in the shadows. You only need to attract the Ogre elites towards us. Do not engage in battle!”</p> <p>“Thank you Sir! We Gnomes will never let you down!”</p> <p>Even though they were incredibly nervous, the worries of the Gnomes eased when they saw the Horned Bee Beasts being hidden amongst them. They’d already seen what the Horned Bee Beasts could do. Furthermore, their mission was only to lead the Ogres over. They did not have to engage in battle.</p> <p>After bowing to Yang Ling, the Gnome Elder clenched his teeth and led his clansmen down the small hill, shouting as they charged toward the nearby cave. Soon, they had attracted the attention of the Ogres patrolling near the entrance of the cave.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, a bunch of Gnomes? I must be seeing things!”</p> <p>“These fellas must be starving if they to dare attack us, the Ogre tribe. They are asking for death!”</p> <p>“Hehe, I’m still a little hungry, so these fellas came at the right time. Oh Yiblis, how long has it been since I had fresh brain?”</p> <p>…</p> <p>The patrolling Ogres were rather surprised when they saw the Gnomes charging over. In the Ladak Mountain Range, the Gnomes were known to be useless trash; a group of them would choose to retreat when they saw a lone Wind Wolf. The Ogres could never have expected that these cowardly creatures would dare attack their own tribe.</p> <p>The winter was harsh. It looked like the Gnomes were so hungry that they had no choice left!</p> <p>Looking at the Gnomes that were not even as thick as their limbs, the Ogres shook their heads in disdain, completely oblivious to the Horned Bee Beasts hiding amongst the Gnomes. In their heads, the Gnomes were digging their own graves.</p> <p>Even though they had short legs, the Gnomes were not slow when they ran at full speed with the help of the downhill slope. They soon charged to the front of the patrolling Ogres.</p> <p>Just as the Ogres were preparing to have a nice meal, a surprise occurred!</p> <p>Without any warning, the Ogres would shudder the moment they lifted their heavy wooden clubs. They would then be subjected to the frenzied attacks of the Gnomes.</p> <p>“Quick, bash in their heads, quick!”</p> <p>The Gnome Elder was elated, seeing the Ogres getting hit by the poisonous stingers of the Horned Bee Beasts in their carelessness, turning numb and helpless. He commanded the group to attack. Wooden clubs, stones, fireballs… They launched all of their abilities.</p> <p>The Ogres had thick hides and muscles, but the backs of their heads were relatively weaker. The Gnomes would have completed their mission as long as they killed these patrolling Ogres and attracted the attention of the other party’s elites.</p> <p>Indeed, after incapacitating a few patrolling Ogres, ferocious Ogres quickly emerged from the cave and charged toward the Gnomes, roaring with bloodlust. The sound of the roars made the Gnomes shiver in fear.</p> <p>The Gnome Elder adapted to the situation. Having successfully attracted the Ogres’ attention, he quickly ordered the group to retreat, running in the direction of the small hill under the cover of the Horned Bee Beasts. The Ogres were too scary, and the Gnomes might be exterminated if they hesitated even a little.</p> <p>Every Horned Bee Beast could only shoot three poisonous stingers in one day. Under their coverfire, the Gnomes quickly retreated to safety. In their rage, the less-than-intelligent Ogres did not sense that anything was off at that point in time.</p> <p>Having a bunch of lowly Gnomes attacking their home was a great humiliation!</p> <p>Seeing the Gnomes that were not even at the height of their knees, the Ogres roared in anger. Unfortunately, their bodies went numb whenever they charged toward the Gnomes and raised their wooden clubs. They were running slower and slower.</p> <p>The Ogres were shocked, thinking that the Gnomes were using some evil magic, but Yang Ling was even more shocked!</p> <p>A normal person would be completely unable to move after being struck by the poisonous stinger of a Horned Bee Beast, and even the powerful barbarians were no exception. But these Ogres were not only staying on their feet, they were managing to chase after the Gnomes at high speeds. They truly lived up to their name as human-shaped Magical Beasts with thick hides and muscles.</p> <p>Laborers, they will make fine laborers!</p> <p>After his surprise, Yang Ling had a thought as he watched the large group of Ogres approaching them. He wanted to capture all of the Ogres alive. Wissen Town needed loggers and miners. In fact, they also needed to build merchant routes on a large scale. They needed as many of these muscular, powerful Ogres as they could get.</p>",
  "Chapter 116: Twin-headed Ogre King": "<p> </p> <p>With the Gnomes drawing them in, more than a hundred bloodthirsty Ogres charged toward Yang Ling. Their three-meter-tall frames, rippling muscles, and those giant clubs… Even Yang Ling was feeling nervous. The cowardly Gnomes almost wet themselves in fear.</p> <p>“Quick, charge up to the top of the hill, quick!”</p> <p>Seeing the Ogres still fiercely chasing after them despite being struck by the poisonous stingers of the Horned Bee Beasts, the Gnome Elder’s face went pale. He had witnessed the power of the poisonous stingers. An ordinary person would not even be able to lift their fingers. To think that these Ogres could run this fast even after being hit. It was incredible!</p> <p>Amidst the roars of the Ogres, facing the threat of death just before them, the Gnomes rushed forward frantically, using all of their strength. The ambushing troops behind the shrubs on the hill were their only hope for survival!</p> <p>Forty steps, thirty-nine steps, thirty-eight steps…</p> <p>The Gnome Elder leading a few brave warriors at the back of the group could faintly see the Evil Eye army behind the shrubs, but at the same time, he could also smell the heavy breath of the Ogres behind him.</p> <p>Am I going to die here?</p> <p>Turning his body to avoid an attack from the Ogres, the Gnome Elder clenched his teeth and charged forward with the last of his strength, his mind a complete blank. The heavy footsteps of the Ogres tugged tightly on his nerves, every sound like a hammer slamming on his brain. His heart beat with every powerful footstep, as if it would soon jump out of his chest.</p> <p>“Sir, do it! It will be too late if you don’t attack now!” Seeing the Ogres approaching them, Argus swallowed with difficulty.</p> <p>The Ogres were a powerful race in the Ladak Mountain Range, and they were very dangerous when it came to close combat. Even the violent Earth Bears were often not a match for them, much less an average person. The outcome would be disastrous if the Ogres managed to engage Yang Ling’s troops in close combat.</p> <p>War is the best way to train a soldier!</p> <p>The barbarians were breathing heavily, and the elf archers were holding their weapons rigidly. Yang Ling shook his head. These soldiers would not be able to become true elites without war as a rite of passage.</p> <p>The ambushing Magical Beast army was different. Even the naturally lazy Evil Eyes were composed, much less the unnerving Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles. After undergoing several bitter battles and evolutions, they had gradually changed from mere Magical Beasts to cold-blooded warriors, ready to strike.</p> <p>“Compose yourself and wait a little longer!”</p> <p>Seeing that there were still many Ogres swarming out of the cave, Yang Ling clenched his teeth. The Ogres wouldn’t be able to retreat once they entered the radius of his embattlement.</p> <p>The Ogres surged after the Gnomes despite being poisoned. In their eyes, the skinny Gnomes were not only a group of enemies, they were also a hearty serving of tasty food. Seeing the fearful Gnomes, they could practically smell the scent of fresh brain matter!</p> <p>In their carelessness, they hadn’t noticed that there were a few dozen more trees, nor did they notice the few small holes near the top of the hill. In the blink of an eye, almost three hundred Ogres had charged into the radius of Yang Ling’s trap.</p> <p>Twenty-eight steps, twenty-seven steps, twenty-six steps…</p> <p>Just as the Ogres were prepared to tear the tired Gnomes in two, something unexpected happened!</p> <p>A dozen shrubs turned into ten-meter-tall giants, their joints covered in sharp spines, their rippling muscles akin to hardy slabs of rock.</p> <p>Looking at the Withered Tree Warriors closing on them with large steps, even the ferocious Ogres could not help but swallow with difficulty. It was the first time they understood what fear was.</p> <p>The Ogres were surprised, to say the least.</p> <p>Rubbing their eyes, they did not understand how the common shrubs had somehow turned into giants. But seeing the bloodthirsty Withered Tree Warriors, they knew that the situation was disadvantageous to them no matter how dumb they were.</p> <p>In the instant when the Ogres were dazed, the prepared Magical Beast army attacked!</p> <p>Under the command of the Evil Eye Tyrant, the Evil Eyes shot out blinding light. The Ogres felt an intense light flash before their eyes, then their eyes became filled with pain. That feeling was as if their eyes had been filled with thick smoke, or as if Ladakma Bees had stung their eyes.</p> <p>In order to capture the Ogres alive, Yang Ling had changed his plan at the last minute.</p> <p>The Evil Eye army immediately stopped attacking and retreated under the commands of the Evil Eye Tyrant, forming a second line of defense. The barbarians stood their ground, protecting the elf archers and the Evil Eye army behind them.</p> <p>The Withered Tree Warriors were responsible for disrupting the Ogres’ formation, while the Gargoyles supported them from the side. The spider army that laid in ambush was responsible for blockading the path of retreat and clearing the caves after most of the Ogres had come out.</p> <p>This way, the responsibility for attacking would lie on the Horned Bee Beasts and elf archers.</p> <p>At Yang Ling’s command, the army of Horned Bee Beasts split into ten teams and unleashed waves of attacks. They were like battle jets, hovering low as they shot out bolts of stingers.</p> <p>At the same time, the elf archers did not disappoint Yang Ling; their arrows landed accurately on the kneecaps of the Ogres.</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling had expected the Ogres to be powerful, he was still shocked at their exceptional defensive capabilities and the power of their charge!</p> <p>At close range, the arrows of the elf archers could pierce through the armor of ordinary cavalry, but it could only pierce a little into the bodies of the Ogres. It looked like it would take a heavy crossbow to penetrate their developed muscles.</p> <p>Furthermore, an average person would not even be able to move a finger after being hit by the poisonous stinger of a Horned Bee Beast. But the Ogres could still walk at high speeds, only falling to the ground after being hit by the second, third, or even fourth stinger.</p> <p>Under the heavy attacks of the Withered Tree Warriors, Horned Bee Beasts, and elf archers, the Ogres became crazed, howling as they attacked the Withered Tree Warriors like bulls.</p> <p>Some of them ignored the sharp thorns and hugged the legs of the Withered Tree Warriors, unwilling to let go even after their heads were bashed in. Some let out loud roars, unleashing frantic attacks with their giant wooden clubs on the lower bodies of the Withered Tree Warriors. Some even charged forward without regard, planning to attack Yang Ling on the top of the hill.</p> <p>The Ogres were powerful and berserk, but they still fell under the combined attacks of the Withered Tree Warriors, Horned Bee Beasts, and elf archers. In front of absolute power, schemes and courage bore no significance.</p> <p>With the Ogres falling one by one, Yang Ling turned his gaze to the cave on the other side. But just as he was about to give the spider army the command to attack, a deafening roar came suddenly from the largest cave.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>The sudden roar was low and powerful. Yang Ling could feel the ground shaking with every roar. The roars became clearer and clearer, more and more powerful, as if some monster was approaching them from underground.</p> <p>Hearing the frenzied roaring, the helpless, defeated Ogres trembled, all of them struggling to get up. The cowardly Gnomes trembled, and the experienced Gnome Elder no exception. His face was pale, his limbs cold and rigid, as if he had caught a whiff of the scent of death.</p> <p>“Sir, retreat, retreat quick. That is the sound of a demon, it is the sound released by the undead souls of the Ogres. Let’s leave quick, otherwise it will be too late!” After swallowing hard, the Gnome Elder looked at Yang Ling in fear. He wanted to run as far away from here as possible.</p> <p>Undead souls?</p> <p>After hearing the fear-inducing roar, Yang Ling looked at the fearful Gnomes and the uneasy Magical Beast army, then he looked at the Ogres struggling to get up. Yang Ling fell silent as he deliberated on a plan.</p> <p>The Ogres were adept in both offense and defense, and they had immense strength. They not only made the most optimal laborer, they were also excellent fighters. If he could bring them back and tame them, they would definitely be extremely valuable warriors.</p> <p>He would not be able to escape too far away with this many captives, but he would feel indignant if he left the Ogres on the ground. It would be like throwing away a piece of meat that he was about to eat.</p> <p>“Get into formation, quick!”</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling decided to take a gamble. Under the protection of the Magical Beast army, he would be able to ride the Unicorn and retreat if things went south. There were not many Magical Beasts that could catch up to the Unicorn on the Tailun Continent.</p> <p>The Withered Tree Warriors, Evil Eyes, and barbarians had just gotten into their formations when a massive twin-headed Ogre charged out of the largest cave. Behind him were a large group of bloodthirsty Ogres.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>Taking a whiff of the thick metallic stench of blood, then looking at Yang Ling and his group on the top of the hill, the ferocious twin-headed Ogre roared into the sky. He was about four meters tall, and his eyes were red. Red hair grew out of his two heads like quills on a porcupine. There was a red lump of flesh between his two heads. It looked like a third head, but also a large tumor, making him look exceptionally ferocious.</p> <p>“The Twin-headed Ogre King! Oh lord, Sir, retreat, retreat quickly!”</p> <p>The Gnome Elder trembled, leading his clansmen to hide behind the army, fearful that the Twin-headed Ogre King would suddenly charge toward them. If not for the army and Yang Ling’s incredible abilities, the Gnome Elder would have fled the area together with his clansmen.</p>",
  "Chapter 117: Bloodthirsty Manic Ring of Light": "<p> </p> <p>After a roar, the Twin-headed Ogre charged over leading his men. His heavy, powerful footsteps, bloodthirsty red eyes, and his giant club that was covered in blood… The hands of all who saw this became clammy. Even the barbarians led by Argus began to pant nervously, much less the cowardly Gnomes.</p> <p>A twin-headed Ogre?</p> <p>Yang Ling had a thought as he watched the Twin-headed Ogre approach them menacingly. To some extent, Ogres were a human-shaped Magical Beast. The mysterious Wizard Technique could tame powerful Magical Beasts, so perhaps it could also tame dull-witted races like the Ogres.</p> <p>Originally, Yang Ling had been worried about how he was going to control all of the Ogres after he had captured them alive. Now it seemed that all his problems would be solved if he managed to tame the Twin-headed Ogre with his blood. It would be as simple and effective as taming the Tarantula King. Taming a king would mean that he would have indirectly obtained an army.</p> <p>“Sir, order the Evil Eye army to attack, otherwise it will be too late!” Seeing the terrifying Twin-headed Ogre approaching them with his massive Ogre army behind him, Argus swallowed with difficulty, becoming more and more nervous.</p> <p>There were many legends in Wissen Town, many of which involved the Ogres.</p> <p>It was rumored that an Ogre would grow two heads on the left and right after receiving the blessings of the Beast God. Their power and speed would increase tenfold, they would gain access to mysterious abilities, and their battle abilities would become immense.</p> <p>It was also rumored that an Ogre would only grow two heads when they were cursed by the Demon God of Hell. Anybody who got near to a monster like this would also receive the curse of the Demon God of Hell, and their life would become worse than death.</p> <p>There were still more rumors that claimed that whenever an Ogre tribe had existed for a few thousand years, the undead souls of the Ogres would plant themselves into the body of an Ogre in order to defend the tribe. They would not only grow two heads, they would also have two hearts. They would be able to revive indefinitely unless one could cut off both their heads at the same time, or pierce both their hearts. They were incredibly terrifying.</p> <p>Argus’s pupils dilated when he thought back to the stories he had heard since he was little, then looked at the ferocious Twin-headed Ogre approaching them. It already took so much effort to capture an average Ogre alive; it was unimaginable that one could capture such a terrifying Twin-headed Ogre alive.</p> <p>“Argus, compose yourself! Your mission is to protect the elf archers and Evil Eyes behind you. You must not leave the formation by your own accord!” Yang Ling said as he took out a large bunch of Wizard Amulets from his ring. He had decided to take another gamble.</p> <p>Thirty-five steps, thirty-four steps, thirty-three steps…</p> <p>The Twin-headed Ogre was fast, arriving before the group in the blink of an eye. What was even more shocking was how it released a blood red ring of light after letting out a loud roar.</p> <p>Wherever the ring of light passed, helpless Ogres who had been inflicted by the poison stingers received a boost of energy, standing up with a roar, as if they had recovered all of the energy they had expended in an instant.</p> <p>“The Bloodthirsty Manic Ring of Light?” Seeing the blood red ring of light surrounding the Twin-headed Ogre, the Gnome Elder lost his color in shock. “Sir, you have to eliminate the Twin-headed Ogre leading them. Otherwise, all of the Ogres will become frenzied monsters! Quick!”</p> <p>According to the historical records, the Bloodthirsty Manic Ring of Light was a high level group magic that the Beastmen performed. It could instantly boost the speed and power of a person, sometimes up to ten times that of the original. It was why the violent Beastmen were so formidable.</p> <p>An ordinary Ogre could already split tigers with his bare hands, so the Gnome Elder could not imagine how much their battle abilities would have improved after their speed and strength had been boosted several times.</p> <p>Just as the Gnomes were shivering, their souls almost leaving their bodies, the Evil Eye army acted once again under the instructions of the Evil Eye Tyrant. In that instant, bolts of blinding light gathered, releasing a strong, hot glow like a miniature sun.</p> <p>The Evil Eyes had acted quickly, but unfortunately, under the command of the Twin-headed Ogre, the Ogres who had once been blindsided by this attack reacted quickly too! After the strong light scattered, save for a few Ogres who were rubbing their eyes and standing in their original position, a large portion of the Ogres were unharmed and charging toward Yang Ling under the command of the Twin-headed Ogre.</p> <p>The attack failed?</p> <p>Seeing the fast reactions of the Twin-headed Ogre, looking at his violent gaze and his body full of explosive muscles, Yang Ling didn’t have any time to waste. He quickly changed his strategy and commanded his Magical Beast army to attack.</p> <p>The ready Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles charged forward, fast as lightning, and launched a coordinated attack. The Horned Bee Beasts were responsible for surprise attacks and feints, while the Gargoyles took the role of dealing the fatal blow given their more powerful attacks. They would either tear the knees of the Ogres or pull out their intestines.</p> <p>Faced with such an unexpected situation, Yang Ling had no choice but to change his strategy at the last minute. He ordered his Magical Beast army to launch fatal attacks. At the very most, he would try to find a way to treat them in the future after injuring them.</p> <p>Sacrificing one’s own forces to defeat the enemy was a taboo in the military. It would not be worth it if Yang Ling had to suffer heavy casualties just to clear out an aboriginal tribe.</p> <p>Wherever the Twin-headed Ogre passed, the average Ogres also started to release blood red rings of light. Their eyes turned red, their muscular bodies standing tall. They roared as if they were bloodthirsty Magical Beasts. The wild beasts nearby fled in fear after hearing these frenzied roars.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>After killing a diving Gargoyle with the swing of a club, the Twin-headed Ogre let out a roar and commanded the Ogres to charge straight toward Yang Ling.</p> <p>After the influence of the magic, their defensive capabilities had reached alarming levels, and they were able to move freely even after being hit by four or five of the Horned Bee Beasts’ poisonous stingers. The Gargoyles’ attacks also seemed to be scratching on metal. The attacks were ineffective unless they hit a vital spot.</p> <p>Is this the power of the bloodthirsty frenzy?</p> <p>Yang Ling’s pupils dilated when he saw the Ogres recover their strength in the blink of an eye, their speed and power enhanced. He instructed the Withered Tree Warriors beside him to move forward, not daring to hesitate.</p> <p>Facing the advancing Ogre army, the Withered Tree Warriors didn’t hold back. They planted their sharp thorns deep into the muscles of the Ogres, then either flung the Ogres far away behind them or pushed the creatures to the ground before stepping on them.</p> <p>The power of the Ogres had reached an alarming stage after being put into a frenzy, but they still paled in comparison to the ten-meter-tall Withered Tree Warriors.</p> <p>The manic Ogre army was pushed back with the counterattack of the Withered Tree Warriors, as if a wave of steel had hit a thick metal plate, unable to advance.</p> <p>Under the cover of the barbarians, the elf archers took steady aim, their arrows all driving into the vital points of the Ogres, frustrating their advance. But they were insignificant compared to the level eight Magical Beast that was the Unicorn.</p> <p>With a deafening scream, the Unicorn quickly released thick bolts of purple lightning, forming an intricate electric web. Within the radius of the web, the Ogres had no way to escape. They let out pathetic cries as they shuddered from being shocked.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>Seeing the heavy casualties among his clansmen, the Twin-headed Ogre was furious, once again slipping into a frenzy. All the muscles on his body started to twitch. He seemed to have grown in an instant, clenching his teeth as he slammed his club into the right leg of the Withered Tree Warrior blocking his way. The impact broke the leg bone of the Withered Tree Warrior.</p> <p>He broke the leg bone of a Withered Tree Warrior with his club?</p> <p>Seeing the ferocious Twin-headed Ogre, the Gnomes hiding behind the army let out shrill shouts, their legs buckling. Argus and the barbarians beside him swallowed hard, their nerves almost causing their hearts to leap in their chests. Even Yang Ling was covered in sweat, not having expected the Ogre king to be this powerful.</p> <p>While there’s life there’s hope!</p> <p>Seeing the Twin-headed Ogre release his bestial instincts, Yang Ling understood that it would be too difficult to capture him alive. In order to minimize his losses, Yang Ling ordered the Magical Beast army to go all out while he clutched the Wizard Amulets in his hands tightly.</p> <p>After successively toppling three Withered Tree Warriors, the ferocious Twin-headed Ogre crossed the Withered Tree Warriors’ line of defense and charged toward Yang Ling. But just as he was about to attack, he was sent flying back by a few Sky Blasting Cannon Wizard Amulets.</p> <p>At the critical moment, Yang Ling had tossed out the Wizard Amulets in his hands as if they cost nothing. He threw the amulets successively, blasting the Twin-headed Ogre until he was covered in blood.</p> <p>If Yang Ling’s Wizard Amulets could make the Twin-headed Ogre dizzy, then the Unicorn’s giant bolts of lightning could make his soul leave his body!</p> <p>After a moment’s preparation, the Unicorn gave its best effort, releasing bolts of bucket-sized, snake-shaped lightning. The Twin-headed Ogre trembled as it was electrocuted, turning charred in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>Seeing that even the Twin-headed Ogre was about to fall, the Ogre army slipped into chaos. The blood red rings of light around their bodies became dimmer, giving the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles the opportunity to attack. Pathetic cries filled the area.</p> <p>Under the combined aerial and ground assault of the Horned Bee Beasts, Withered Tree Warriors, Horned Bee Beasts, and Gargoyles, the Ogres who had lost their leader gradually lost the will to fight. But just as they were about to retreat into the cave and defend themselves, another surprise happened!</p> <p>Under the command of the Tarantula King, the spider army emerged from the ground and split into two teams. One team was responsible for attacking the retreating Ogres while the other team charged quickly into the cave of the Ogres.</p> <p>Blanketing poison, venomous fangs, and immense numbers…</p> <p>The appearance of the spider army completely crumbled the Ogres’ will to fight. The old and injured that were guarding the caves were unable to defend against the tide-like attack of the spider army.</p>",
  "Chapter 118: Soul Control": "<p>Under the combined aerial and land assault of the Magical Beast army, the Ogres soon fell one by one. A tally after the battle showed that even without those who died on the spot or were missing a limb and had lost their value as workers, there were still about four hundred able-bodied Ogres left.</p> <p>The four hundred strong, muscular Ogres could form a highly effective team of loggers or initiate a small scale development of a crystal mine. They could also be formed into a vanguard and used to charge into enemy lines…</p> <p>After the situation was under control, Yang Ling ordered the group to tie up the Ogre captives and apply bandages to stop their bleeding. He then walked quickly in front of the Twin-headed Ogre who had been electrocuted to a crisp.</p> <p>Despite being heavily injured and barely able to breathe, the Twin-headed Ogre still stared at Yang Ling in anger, clenching his teeth, as if he was trying his best to stand up. But the creature was rendered immobile by the Withered Tree Warriors who held all four of its limbs.</p> <p>Good grief, this thing is powerful!</p> <p>Looking at the Twin-headed Ogre glaring at him, Yang Ling had to admire his perseverance. An average Magical Beast would have died after receiving the full power of the Unicorn’s attacks. To think that this creature was still breathing despite being electrocuted to a crisp.</p> <p>Why not just tame him with my blood?</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, an evil thought popped into Yang Ling’s head as he looked at the nearby Ogres.</p> <p>Blood Essence that harbored Wizard Powers could tame Magical Beasts, but he had never tried it on intelligent, humanoid creatures. If he could successfully tame the Twin-headed Ogre, it would open the door to a whole new realm of possibilities.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, he clenched his teeth and decided to take the gamble.</p> <p>Ogres were naturally violent. It would take a while for them to become honest laborers even if he found a way to tame them. But if he was able to subdue this powerful Twin-headed Ogre with his blood and order the Ogre captives through him, it would definitely be more effective and convenient.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Twin-headed Ogre was on the precipice of death, the weakest it would ever be. Taming the creature with his blood now would greatly decrease the amount of Wizard Power and Blood Essence he had to use. If it did not work, Yang Ling believed that he could keep himself from being devoured instead if he stopped in time.</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged, Yang Ling took a deep breath. He then slowly pressed his blood-covered index finger onto the Twin-headed Ogre’s forehead. Its expression was fearful.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>The Twin-headed Ogre trembled the moment it came into contact with Yang Ling’s Blood Essence, letting out a pained roar. Then, its bloodthirsty red eyes gradually became dull, turning a strange dark green. Its muscles started trembling.</p> <p>In its great pain, the Twin-headed Ogre started struggling intensely, its strength increasing. It screamed as it thrashed about, as if it was turning insane. Its voice was deep and raspy, as if the noise was coming from its bones and soul instead of its throat.</p> <p>Could it be that Yang Ling was unable to tame an intelligent being?</p> <p>Yang Ling creased his brows as he looked at the struggling Twin-headed Ogre. He recalled the time when he had forcefully tried to increase the level of the Evil Eye Tyrant, and he suddenly had an idea. He clenched his teeth as he started injecting Wizard Power and life force into the Ogre at the same time, gradually increasing its intensity.</p> <p>Unlike an average person, the Twin-headed Ogre not only had two brains, it also had two almost identical hearts. After exploring for a moment, Yang Ling found that the creature also had two identical pituitary glands in its two brains.</p> <p>The Wizard Power would activate the Essence Crystal, while the life force would activate the pituitary gland!</p> <p>Despite searching for some time, Yang Ling was unable to find any Essence Crystals in the body of the Twin-headed Ogre. He considered for a moment, then guided the blood red Wizard Power into two separate paths, attacking both of its hearts. At the same time, the green life force also split into two streams, agitating the Twin-headed Ogre’s pituitary glands.</p> <p>Indeed, after Yang Ling had grasped the technique, the Twin-headed Ogre immediately stopped struggling. It gradually calmed down as Yang Ling adjusted the ratio of Wizard Power and life force. Slowly, it even started actively absorbing the energy from Yang Ling’s body.</p> <p>This was basically what had happened in Valenia Valley!</p> <p>As the breathing of the Twin-headed Ogre become more and more stable, Yang Ling heaved a sigh of relief. But just as he was about to begin injecting a higher volume of energy, the Twin-headed Ogre began to murmur quietly. Following which, a bolt of red light flashed past Yang Ling. A strange blood red ring of light appeared suddenly around them and the breathing of the Ogres became faster.</p> <p>Bloodthirsty frenzy?</p> <p>Bathed by the red light, Yang Ling felt his muscles expanding uncontrollably, his body filling up with explosive power. At the same time, his thoughts became dull, his consciousness hazy.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>Letting out a roar, the Twin-headed Ogre’s muscles swelled. Its two heads shook uncontrollably, its hearts beating intensely. Its pituitary glands released waves of messy ripples as it devoured the Wizard Power and life force within Yang Ling’s body. Its four limbs struggled intensely.</p> <p>Not good!</p> <p>Seeing the dire turn that events had taken, Yang Ling was shocked that the situation had gone out of his control so quickly. He instinctively tried to pull back his index finger. Unexpectedly, he was unable to retract his finger no matter what he did. It was stuck to the head of the Twin-headed Ogre. His consciousness became increasingly hazy as his Wizard Power and life force welled out of his body.</p> <p>The Twin-headed Ogre howled loudly in pain and began struggling, and Yang Ling’s face became more and more pale. Argus started to panic, pacing around like an ant in a hot pan. He could not find a solution even after discussing it with the Gnome Elder.</p> <p>“A curse, it is the curse of the Demon God of Hell!”</p> <p>“That’s right, that is the curse of the Demon God of Hell, a curse that makes one’s life worse than death. Run quick!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Hearing the Twin-headed Ogre’s pathetic cry delivered straight from its soul and seeing Yang Ling turn pale in an instant, the naturally cowardly Gnomes started shivering incessantly. They fled after letting out a few cries, running away faster than rabbits. Even the Gnome Elder could not stop them.</p> <p>…</p> <p>“Leader, I’ll return immediately to the tribe and to get our priest!”</p> <p>“No, our tribe is too far away. Take the Unicorn and bring Sir Goode over here!”</p> <p>Seeing the dire situation, the elf archers were overcome with worry. They were helpless when faced with such a strange situation, unless they brought the elder or their priests over.</p> <p>“Alright, I’ll rush back to Wissen Town immediately. Form a defensive formation around him, and do not leave this place on your own accord!” After a moment’s hesitation, Argus gave a decisive order before leaping onto the Unicorn and leaving clouds of dust behind him.</p> <p>Ordinarily, the proud Unicorn would never allow anyone else to ride it. But as a high level Magical Beast with a certain level of intelligence, it understood that Yang Ling was in critical condition, and thus rendered its full cooperation to Argus’s plan.</p> <p>The people became more nervous when Argus left. The elf archers clutched their bows uneasily, and the barbarians rubbed their tire-sized axes repeatedly. The naturally cowardly Gnomes were even more fearful. They might have scattered if not for the orders of their elder.</p> <p>A cold wind blew. The snowflakes became bigger and the temperature fell!</p> <p>Some time later, just as Yang Ling felt his eyelids become heavy, the Wizard Power and life force in his body almost depleted, the pagoda-shaped mark between his brows began to throb intensely. It continuously released a massive rush of chaotic power. The energy circulated along a mysterious path in his body. One round after the next, repeating in a cycle.</p> <p>Under the stimulus that was the massive amounts of energy, the Soul Ring on Yang Ling’s finger also released a bolt of ice cold energy, circling in his body together with the chaotic energy. Wherever it passed, the massively expanded muscles contracted rapidly, dispelling the influence of the bloodthirsty frenzy. Yang Ling’s consciousness also slowly became clearer.</p> <p>After taking in a deep breath, Yang Ling instinctively injected the chaotic energy in his body into the Ogre. Soon, the Twin-headed Ogre, its throat bleeding from its own roaring, started to calm down. The blood red ring of light it released became dull, and its overly-expanded muscles also slowly started to contract.</p> <p>With the injection of a large amount of chaotic energy, the mud on the Twin-headed Ogre’s body began to crumble and fall away. It slowly started to grow a layer of closely knitted scales. Looking closely, there were faint signs of a pattern, like a complicated map or the image of a ferocious Magical Beast. It was incredibly strange.</p> <p>After letting out another roar, the Twin-headed Ogre took advantage of the Withered Tree Warriors’ distraction and forced itself out of their restraints. It was powerful, its strength having increased several times.</p> <p>“Braska pays his respects to his master!”</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling raised his guard, expecting the taming process to have failed, the Twin-headed Ogre got on its knees and grovelled before him.</p> <p>His efforts had paid off!</p> <p>Looking at the Twin-headed Ogre bowing before him, Yang Ling was incredibly excited. Sitting cross-legged and absorbing the chaotic energy released by the Wizard’s Pagoda, his body became filled with a raging Wizard Power. He could clearly capture the thoughts of the Twin-headed Ogre.</p> <p>Unlike the Tarantula King and Evil Eye Tyrant, Ogres were intelligent, humanoid creatures, even though they were a little dull. When Yang Ling communicated with the Evil Eye Tyrant and Tarantula King, they could only release strange ripples. The Twin-headed Ogre, on the other hand, could quickly understand orders and even voice its own thoughts and opinions.</p> <p>This was the power of a Wizard’s blood!</p> <p>Seeing the once raging Twin-headed Ogre listening to his every order, Yang Ling understood that he had taken another successful gamble. Observing the Ogre’s soul and memories closely, Yang Ling slowly understood that the Ogres possessed many secrets.</p> <p>The Ogres had a secret ability. Before a tribe leader died, they could pass on their memories and the method of developing the Bloodthirsty Battle Energy to the next tribe leader. When the Bloodthirsty Battle Energy was cultivated to a certain degree, the new tribe leader would evolve and grow two heads.</p> <p>After gaining two heads and two hearts, the evolved Ogre would receive a great boost in power. Their speed and power would increase, and they would also gain the ability to induce a Bloodthirsty Frenzy. After cultivating the ability to a great degree, they could even regenerate endlessly if they did not receive a fatal blow on both of their hearts or heads at the same time, just like the legends suggested. They were unparalleled in close combat.</p> <p>After evolving and growing a second head, the Twin-headed Ogre would also gain a fatal weakness despite its powerful abilities.</p> <p>A painful lump of meat would grow between the two heads, becoming larger as the Ogre became more powerful. Their thought processes would also become messier. When the affliction became serious, the two heads would hurt like they had been stabbed by a knife. Every tribe leader who had successfully evolved eventually killed themselves, unable to bear with the pain.</p> <p>After being tamed by Yang Ling, the Twin-headed Ogre Braska discovered that the lump of meat between its heads had vanished. The troubling thoughts that had bothered it for many years had also vanished. In its elation, it fully accepted Yang Ling as its master, despite knowing that its soul would forever be under Yang Ling’s control.</p> <p>“Master, thank you for dealing with the demon in my head!”</p> <p>After confirming that the lump of meat had vanished from between its heads, Braska was elated. It grovelled respectfully before Yang Ling.</p> <p>Demon in its head?</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, Yang Ling understood that the demon that Braska was talking about was the large tumor between its heads. Yang Ling had considered that the tumor might have been a mutated strain of cancer.</p> <p>After searching through the Ogre’s memories, Yang Ling made some deductions.</p> <p>After the Ogre evolved, its troubled thoughts might have been caused by the two heads fighting for control over the body, and this would lead to brain cancer as time went by, creating frequent, regular headaches. Serious cases might even lead to the development of split personalities or mental illnesses.</p> <p>To think that using his blood could have such unexpected effects!</p> <p>Feeling the clear thoughts of the Twin-headed Ogre Braska, then comparing those to its messy memories of the past, even Yang Ling was shocked beyond words. According to the explanation of the stele, a wizard would gradually learn to wield the ability to control souls, and through that, the wizard would eventually come into contact with the true source of power in this world.</p> <p>It looked like he still had a long way to go. He was only beginning to cultivate the Wizard Techniques, despite having advanced to the level of Spirit Wizard.</p> <p>While Yang Ling was lost in thought, the Twin-headed Ogre Braska was filled with anticipation for the future.</p> <p>If it could continue developing the Bloodthirsty Battle Energy with Yang Ling’s help, it would not be long until the creature’s tribe became powerful. They would no longer have to worry about their depleting rations whenever winter came.</p>",
  "Chapter 119: Army of Captives": "<p>The Twin-headed Ogre Braska was full of anticipation for the future, and Yang Ling was no exception.</p> <p>The issue preventing the evolution of the Ogres was not the method of cultivation, but the fatal tumor. If they could find a way that could guarantee the success of the evolution, that would mean that every Ogre would be able to cultivate their unique Bloodthirsty Battle Energy and increase the speed of their evolution.</p> <p>The Ogres were naturally strong and powerful. If a large bunch of Ogres who had evolved to grow two heads appeared, their incredible strength, blinding speed, and the Bloodthirsty Frenzy… They would become a group of close-range killing machines.</p> <p>Now that Yang Ling had tamed the powerful Twin-headed Ogre King, there was no longer a need to bind the ordinary Ogres. Releasing their restraints, the Ogres started to bow before Yang Ling, following Braska’s lead.</p> <p>The Ogres were an intelligent race. Didn’t being able to tame the Ogres with his blood mean that he could tame humans too, humans who were regarded as the master of all creatures?</p> <p>Seeing the Ogres grovelling before him, Yang Ling started imagining things in his heart despite having no change in his expression. For some reason, he suddenly thought about the suited lady he had seen on the public bus in the past. He recalled her exquisite brows, her slender waist, her perky buttocks…</p> <p>Perhaps taming a female servant wouldn’t be a bad idea?</p> <p>An evil thought suddenly sprang into Yang Ling’s mind. The slender face of the female assassin flashed past his brain. In fact, he even recalled the capable Harribell, her silky skin and large, beautiful eyes.</p> <p>Yang Ling only came to his senses after Goode had rushed over with a large group of warriors.</p> <p>“Sir, are you alright?” Seeing that Yang Ling seemed to be fine, then looking at the large group of Ogres grovelling before him, Goode turned to Argus in confusion.</p> <p>“Goode, I’m fine! You came at the right time!” Seeing Goode covered in dust, then looking at the panting Argus, Yang Ling did not have to think too deeply before understanding what had happened. “How long would it take to make sets of heavy armor and giant clubs for these Ogres?”</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, Goode swallowed with difficulty as he looked at the three-meter-tall Ogres. Even unarmed, the Ogres were a barbaric race whose fierce reputation had spread throughout the Ladak Mountain Range. No one could imagine their battle abilities if they were equipped with heavy armor and giant clubs.</p> <p>“Sir, most of the steel ore in town has been expended. Without sufficient manpower or enough steel ore, we might not be able to make many clubs and sets of armor in a short amount of time!” Goode felt a little troubled as he thought about their increasing expenses.</p> <p>“You shall be in charge of scouting for resources near Wissen Town and finding quality steel ore as soon as possible. You can count on me for manpower!” Yang Ling continued after a pause, “We will need to develop large fields during the spring to grow enough food. We will also need a large amount of tools for developing land along with a large amount of armor and weapons. Remember that!”</p> <p>Terras Forest had many sources of water, and so Wissen Town had easy access to that water.</p> <p>The Donau River had massive amounts of water, and it twisted and turned its way around Wissen Town until it reached the sea in the south.</p> <p>As long as he had enough manpower to draw water from the Donau River, Yang Ling believed that he would be able to develop a sizeable area of arable land and grow a substantial amount of crops. With enough food, the development of Wissen Town would have a sturdy safeguard. He would be able to attract and recruit many travellers and even small tribes to live there permanently.</p> <p>What Wissen Town lacked most was not crystal coins, but a sufficient flow of traffic. Wissen Town only had a population of thirty thousand, even after factoring in the troops, merchants, and adventurers who were only moving through. That was far from enough.</p> <p>There were countless races and small tribes on the outskirts of Terras Forest, the Ladak Mountain Range, and the Aila Mountain Pass. Yang Ling would receive adequate manpower in a short span of time if he could attract them to stay permanently in Wissen Town.</p> <p>Clearing the aboriginal tribes around the Ladak Mountain Range would ensure safe passage for merchants and provide Yang Ling with a large quantity of low cost labor. Now that he had gained a powerful Ogre army, Yang Ling’s confidence in this plan increased dramatically.</p> <p>After resting in the Ogre tribe for a few days and waiting for the Ogres to recover, he ordered his army to move once again. This time, other than the Gnomes who would continue to act as bait, he now had an Ogre army three hundred men strong.</p> <p>According to Braska’s memories, there were still a few Ogre tribes around them. With his guidance, Yang Ling led his army directly toward a snow-covered valley, prepared to subdue the closest Ogre tribe.</p> <p>The Ogres had thick hides and powerful muscles. They could be used to both attack and defend. They were not only the most ideal laborers, they were also the most powerful infantry units Yang Ling had encountered. Even though they were not as powerful as the ten-meter-tall Withered Tree Warriors, there were many more of them.</p> <p>If he could subdue a large group of Ogres and create more infantry troops, the army under his control would gain the ability to engage in three-dimensional battles.</p> <p>The Evil Eyes would be responsible for powerful attacks. Even though they were slow, their firepower was immense. They were the cannoneers of the army. The Horned Bee Beasts were responsible for surprise attacks. Even though they were unable to face off directly against powerful enemies, their fast speeds and poisonous stingers gave them an advantage. They were the fighter jets used for surprise attacks and covering the other units in the army.</p> <p>The Withered Tree Warriors had powerful attacks and exceptional defense. Even though they were relatively slow, they were still terrifying to face on the ground. They were the heavy tanks in the army. The Gargoyles had sharp attacks and were fast as lightning. Even though their defenses were weak and there were not enough of them, they could still carry out devastating sneak attacks.</p> <p>With their ability to dig into the ground, their fatal poison, and their massive numbers, the spider army was not only highly effective in attacking targets on the ground, they could also deal with low flying enemy units. They were one of Yang Ling’s trump cards, even though they were now the only units that could fire high into the air, as well as the only land army.</p> <p>The Gnomes were naturally cowardly, but they were ingenious. Yang Ling believed that they could act as excellent bait and craftsmen after a little training. This army was lacking a team of infantry. Even though the spider army was strong, they were not enough to hold off a strong enemy charging toward them.</p> <p>The Ogres were immensely strong and not afraid of death. Yang Ling was sure that they would become an elite trump card after being equipped with heavy armor and giant clubs. With the addition of such heavy infantry, the abilities of the entire army had been enhanced by a whole level.</p> <p>After instructing the Magical Beast army to set up a heavy ambush outside the valley, Yang Ling ordered the Gnomes to move out. The elder led the Gnomes forward, walking quickly. Despite still being nervous, they were no longer as fearful as they had been before. They felt more at ease after seeing Yang Ling’s power and the might of the army behind him.</p> <p>Just like before, under the provocation of the Gnomes, large groups of Ogres chased after them, roaring. They carelessly fell for Yang Ling’s ambush.</p> <p>The outcome was clear after the aerial and ground assault of the Magical Beast army!</p> <p>In the short span of an hour, Yang Ling had easily defeated the main forces of the Ogres. Faced with the massive Magical Beast army, the Ogres who had no place to run off to could only kneel and surrender.</p> <p>A tally showed that there were still about eight hundred Ogres in the valley. After accounting for the old, weak, and injured, there were still about five hundred fit Ogres. Yang Ling could form an army of eight hundred Ogres with the Twin-headed Ogre Braska as its leader.</p> <p>After resting for a moment, Yang Ling sent the old and weak members of the two Ogre tribes back to Wissen Town. Firstly, it would eliminate any distractions for the Ogre army and allow them to fight with all their hearts. Second, he could also make use of the Ogres’ full potential. Those who weren’t fit for the battlefield could still cut wood or excavate mines. Even those who were weaker could still help pave the roads.</p> <p>“Sir, according to the news from the tribe, the first cart of rations that you sent us is nearly exhausted. Do you think you can…”</p> <p>Seeing the old and weak Ogres being sent into Wissen Town and not having to worry about food, the Gnome Elder’s eyes turned red with envy. But he knew that other than helping draw spell formations and acting as bait, his clansmen were incomparable to the powerful Ogres. He did not hope that his entire clan could be moved to Wissen Town. All he wished was that Yang Ling could supply them with enough rations for his clansmen to last through the long winter.</p> <p>Yang Ling swallowed a mouthful of golden-brown wolf meat, then looked at the dancing snowflakes in the air and the Gnome Elder with his white beard. Yang Ling started deliberating. With Wissen Town’s remaining rations, it would not be a problem to feed two and a half thousand Gnomes through the winter. If everything was successful, Wissen Town would be able to grow huge fields of crops next year. Another couple thousand Gnomes would not be too much of a burden to him.</p> <p>“Elder, have you been to Wissen Town?” After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling did not answer the Gnome Elder’s question. He sliced off a piece of browned wolf meat and handed it to the elder.</p> <p>“Yes, more than ten years ago. I went with the elder before me!”</p> <p>The Gnome Elder did not understand Yang Ling’s intentions. He mumbled, his expression a little awkward. He had indeed been to Wissen Town back then. He had been there with a large group of aboriginal tribes to steal food, but they were repelled by the powerful Anca family.</p> <p>Even though the Anca family was usually violent, they went even farther when dealing with the thieving aborigines. Dismemberment, skinning, burying them alive… They employed everything, scaring the various tribes who were tempted to repeat the act during the winters. That was also the reason why the townspeople kept living in Wissen. Otherwise, the aborigines would have made life in Wissen too dangerous to be worthwhile.</p> <p>“Then what do you feel Wissen Town lacks the most?” Yang Ling swallowed a mouthful of warm wine, not paying too much attention to the Gnome Elder’s awkward expression.</p> <p>What does Wissen Town lack the most? Crystal coins, rations… Or beautiful women? The Gnome Elder was hesitant. It was not easy to answer Yang Ling’s question in such a short amount of time.</p> <p>“Elder, what I lack most in my land is a large number of capable men!” Seeing the hesitant Gnome Elder, Yang Ling said directly, “The Magical Beast Territory will welcome anyone and protect them and their families as long as they possess a skill, no matter their race. After this, I will give you five more carts of rations and permit you to move a hundred of your clansmen to live permanently in town. If you fully prove your usefulness in my territory, I believe everyone will welcome the Gnome race into our formation.”</p> <p>We might be able to move the entire clan into the Magical Beast Territory?</p> <p>Yang Ling had just said this when the Gnome Elder grovelled respectfully before him. He knew that the greatest advantage his race possessed was their ability to draw magical spells. If he could draw a large number of spell formations using Magical Beast Blood Essence, he believed that Yang Ling would not go back on his word. There might truly be hope for the future of his clansmen.</p> <p>The ingenious Gnomes, the powerful Ogres… Yang Ling started coming up with plans after taking a mouthful of strong liquor. His plans for developing Wissen Town were beginning to come together.</p>",
  "Chapter 120: Beastmen Tribe": "<p>Under the guidance of the Twin-headed Ogre Braska, Yang Ling and his army successively conquered five other Ogre tribes in only a few days. He not only expanded the heavy infantry army of Ogres to fifteen hundred men, he also obtained more than three thousand strong laborers.</p> <p>When the Ogre laborers began arriving in Wissen Town in groups, Goode became incredibly busy. He not only had to order the people to scout for mines around them, he also had to look for wood to build temporary buildings. In addition, he had to set up a relief team to provide Yang Ling with supplies, as well. Luckily, Yang Ling’s storage ring could hold many items; otherwise, just the transportation of rations and expended arrows would have required a large amount of manpower.</p> <p>The snowy winter was not ideal an ideal time for building houses, but in order to settle the increasing number of immigrants, Goode had no choice but to find ways to build simple wooden houses. As long as they could last the next few months, they would be able to cut enough rock from quarries to build more stable houses when the weather became warmer.</p> <p>With the continuous support from Wissen Town, Yang Ling continued leading his army and clearing the tribes scattered around the Ladak Mountain Range, hoping to secure enough manpower for the coming spring.</p> <p>According to his plan, he needed to conduct large scale developments on resources such as timber and metal ore next year, and he needed to build a large port where the Donau River met the sea. He also needed to open a path from Wissen Town to the Aila Mountain Pass. All this required a large amount of cheap labor.</p> <p>There was not enough time left. He had to finish his preparations by spring!</p> <p>In this period of time, despite the lack of action from the Banto Empire or the troops and adventurers in Wissen Town, Yang Ling did not dare let his guard down.</p> <p>To the southwest of Wissen Town, after a vast nothingness, was the Banto Empire. Their attitude toward Wissen Town was still unclear. Even though Yang Ling’s army could defend themselves against a large scale attack by their enemies by stationing themselves at the Aila Mountain Pass, doing so would leave Wissen Town with no exit on land if an enemy sent a large army to surround the Aila Mountain Pass.</p> <p>South of Wissen Town was a vast ocean. It was rumored that there were countless pirates in the ocean, seafolk who would kill without blinking an eye. Even though Harribell had promised to build a large harbor and provide sea charts, even she was not sure if she could open a safe passage.</p> <p>The next year was critical. Whether or not he could consolidate his control over his land and build a base from which he could explore this world would depend on the results of the next year. But before any of that, he had to obtain a large amount of cheap labor by spring. Otherwise, all of this was empty talk.</p> <p>This day, after moving his army for half a day, Yang Ling instructed his troops to rest by the side of a valley. Their target this time was a Beastmen tribe ten miles away.</p> <p>“Beastman” was a generic title, covering all of the humanoids who had beast-like characteristics. There were Bullmen who had horns growing out of their heads, Foxmen who had tails, and even Swanmen who grew wings on their backs.</p> <p>Legend had it that there were no Beastmen on the continent a long time ago. A few thousand years ago, after humans rose to power with the help of the Church, they got into a tug-of-war with the Orc Empire, with both parties capturing many captives. Slowly, different races gradually sprang up.</p> <p>A few thousand years ago, the Beastmen were not recognized by the humans, nor were they approved by the Orcs. Even though they had large numbers, they did not even have an independent territory, much less an empire or a country. They did not have status or respect, and they were the main source of slaves on the continent.</p> <p>“Sir, according to the report of the scouts, the Beastmen tribe in front of us has about three thousand Beastmen of various kinds!” Yang Ling had just sat down when a scout hurried toward him and reported loudly.</p> <p>A Beastmen tribe with various kinds of Beastmen?</p> <p>Yang Ling was a little curious, so Argus began to explain. The Beastmen had various abilities: some were immensely strong, and some were good at calculations but had little physical capability. Because of their similar circumstances, many of the Beastmen lived together, forming tribes of various different kinds of Beastmen to improve their chances of survival.</p> <p>“Sir, the scout noticed the tracks of Dogmen in the tribe, so we have to be careful when we act. Otherwise, they’ll discover us easily!” Argus creased his brows. The Dogmen had keen senses and agile movements. They were natural hunters in the forest. Yang Ling’s army might have to spend a little effort in order to conquer this tribe.</p> <p>“Send the Horned Bee Beasts to finish off their scouts. We act according to the plan. Let’s go!” Yang Ling said as he leapt onto the Unicorn.</p> <p>The Dogmen were unique amongst the Beastmen. Even though their physical abilities were not exceptional, they had keen senses and moved with blind speed. They were the ideal candidates as scouts and spies. Yang Ling believed that it would definitely be beneficial to his future plans if he managed to subdue an entire tribe of Dogmen.</p> <p>Under the guidance of the scout, the army drew close to the Beastmen tribe an hour later. As a precaution, Yang Ling ordered the group to hide behind some low lying thickets. He sat cross-legged, prepared to order the Horned Bee Beasts to deal with the enemy’s hidden scouts.</p> <p>The tribe of Beastmen was situated in the middle of a forest, with only a small, heavily guarded path in and out of the lair. Other than the hidden scouts, the forest was also covered in long thorny vines. An average person would find it difficult to even plant their feet here.</p> <p>Smart. It truly is heavily defended!</p> <p>Through the fast flying Horned Bee Beasts, Yang Ling soon understood the distribution of the Beastmen’s forces. There were more than twenty scouts hidden around the forest, either lying under the withered leaves or in the treetops. If not for the keen senses of the Horned Bee Beasts, Yang Ling might not have been able to spot them in such a short span of time.</p> <p>There were many hidden scouts in the perimeter of the forest, but the defenses were even stronger nearer to the tribe. As well as the hidden scouts, there was also a team of warriors patrolling the surroundings with hunting dogs. Their defenses were much stronger than those of the Ogre tribes.</p> <p>Shall I lure them out and kill them all, or just send the Ogres to launch a strong offensive?</p> <p>Yang Ling hesitated after learning the strength of the enemy’s defenses. The Beastmen were clearly much more intelligent than the Ogres. Sending the Gnomes to lure them out might not be worth it, and it might even alert them instead.</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was hesitating, a low signal suddenly sounded from within the Beastmen tribe. Warriors emerged from within the wooden huts, quickly getting into formation, all fully ready to take action.</p> <p>“Guests from far away, we do not have any food stores in our tribe. May I invite you to look elsewhere!”</p> <p>Soon, under the guard of a bunch of warriors, an elder with soulful eyes walked out with large strides. He had a black staff in hand and a tiny bushy tail behind him. It looked like he was a Foxmen priest. From his words, it seemed that he thought that the group were aborigines trying to rob them.</p> <p>Yang Ling had no idea how the Beastmen had noticed them, but he could no longer hide. He stood up.</p> <p>“A team of merchants was killed near this area a few days ago. Might I know if you have any news about that?” After being exposed, Yang Ling continued, calm and composed, “I am the leader of Wissen Town. I will reward you greatly if you can provide us with accurate information!”</p> <p>Seeing that he would not be able to defeat the Beastmen’s heavy defenses easily, Yang Ling decided to approach this from another angle. Many times he could obtain more of what he wanted on the negotiations table than on the battlefield. He did not have to attack all the time.</p> <p>This was like America back on Earth, solving most of their problems through global negotiations using their powerful politics, economy, and military. Other than the Gulf War, they had not truly engaged in war in recent times.</p> <p>The Leader of Wissen?</p> <p>Seeing the composed Yang Ling and the bloodthirsty Magical Beast army behind him, the elder was shocked. His expression sank even more after he discussed with the warriors around him and learned more about Yang Ling’s identity.</p> <p>The scouts in his tribe had seen Yang Ling in person in Wissen Town, and considering the horde of Magical Beasts around him, this was definitely the real Yang Ling. But why had this man suddenly led a large army to his tribe?</p> <p>As an elder of a fox tribe, the elder had encountered countless hardships over the years, but he had never been as nervous as he was today. Even the ten thousand elite troops of the Banto Empire were not a match for Yang Ling. The outcome would be disastrous if Yang Ling had come today with the motive of attacking the tribe.</p> <p>The fox elder knew that his tribe was heavily guarded and a dangerous opponent to the aborigines who pillaged for a living. But he was definitely no match for Yang Ling, whose abilities were unfathomable.</p> <p>Seeing the elder’s pale face and creased brows, Yang Ling was expressionless, but he knew that his plan had already half-succeeded.</p> <p>Recalling the Magical Beast army and signalling for the warriors behind him to lower their weapons, Yang Ling said, “Do not be nervous, we’re just passing by. Even if you have no news of the culprits, we might be able to cooperate in some other areas!”</p> <p>After allowing the elder to understand his status and abilities, Yang Ling quickly tried to show that he wasn’t hostile. It was sometimes necessary to threaten your opponent, but if you went too far, they might become desperate and resort immediately to violence.</p> <p>“Sir, I am the elder of the fox clan. Welcome to our tribe.” After seeing Yang Ling voluntarily recall his army, the fox elder heaved a sigh of relief and instructed the warriors beside him to open a path.</p> <p>Ordering Argus to lead the army somewhere outside the forest, Yang Ling led a few Ogres into the forest under the invitation of the fox elder. Soon, they arrived at the Beastmen tribe.</p> <p>Along the way, he saw many small kids running around, playing with each other. To the east of the tribe was a row of wooden huts used to rear animals, and a few women were feeding the livestock. It looked like with the intelligence of the Beastmen, the tribe should still have a decent amount of rations, much better than the Ogres and Gnomes.</p> <p>“Sir, please sit!”</p> <p>The fox elder brought Yang Ling to a large wooden hut, his attitude respectful and welcoming. He had become more at ease after understanding that Yang Ling had not come for his tribe, and he was secretly thinking about how he could use this opportunity to collaborate with Yang Ling. After all, even though Wissen Town was not large, it was the only human territory in a thousand mile radius. Maintaining good relations with Yang Ling would definitely be beneficial for his tribe in the future.</p>",
  "Chapter 121: Bombs that Grow on Trees": "<p>Yang Ling had not been sitting down for long when a few elders with dog heads and human bodies walked in. The fox elder began to explain that the Dogmen and Foxmen each accounted for half of the three thousand five hundred members in the tribe, with each race having their own elder. The two elders would discuss and come to a consensus whenever there was an important decision to be made.</p> <p>“Sir Leader, might I ask if you could supply us with weapons and armor!” The impatient dog elder directly stated the tribe’s difficulties after a few formalities.</p> <p>The Beastmen had accumulated a good amount of rations after a long time of preparation. They wouldn’t have any problems lasting through the winter.</p> <p>But both the Foxmen and Dogmen were not adept in forging weapons, and thus the tribe had a perpetual shortage of weapons and armor. They often felt that they were powerless when facing against the surrounding aborigines who pillaged for a living. That was also the reason for their exceptionally strong defenses.</p> <p>“I have a group of dwarves and human steelsmiths under me. Unfortunately, I have expended much of my steel ore in recent times. I might not be able to supply you with much in the way of weapons and armor for the time being!” After a pause, Yang Ling continued, “The problem would be much simpler if you could supply me with a large amount of steel ore!”</p> <p>Seeing that the Beastmen had been the first to state a request, Yang Ling knew that he was one step closer to his plan. The Foxmen had slender and weak frames, but they had the highest proportion of priests amongst all of the Beastmen. The Dogmen were not suitable to charge in the vanguard, but they were as fast as lightning and had keen senses, making them the most suitable scouts and hunters.</p> <p>It would definitely be beneficial in the long term development of Wissen Town if he could successfully subdue a large group of Foxmen and Dogmen. Taking a step back, even if he were unable to subdue them, it was still a decent choice if he could obtain a large amount of cheap labor through cooperation.</p> <p>Supply a large amount of steel ore?</p> <p>The expression of the dog elder became worried. He had never seen any steel mines around the area, despite having lived here for dozens of years. The tribe had never possessed many weapons or pieces of armor, and a lack of steel ore was part of the reason for that shortage.</p> <p>“Sir leader, there are no steel mines around our tribe!” Seeing the worry on the dog elder’s face, the fox elder deliberated for a moment before continuing, “But there is a large sulfur mine about ten miles to the east!”</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head after a moment’s surprise. A large sulfur mine would definitely have great value and attract many investment firms on Earth, but in this foreign world, Yang Ling could not think of any uses for sulfur in such a short span of time.</p> <p>“Sulfur might not have too much use to an average person. But a few years ago, we unintentionally discovered a secret!” The fox elder carefully took out a black fruit the size of a pineapple from a bag.</p> <p>A secret?</p> <p>The black fruit had a vile stench, its scent similar to wet paint or petroleum. Yang Ling could not understand what secrets the Beastmen might have discovered. Could they be trying to stink their enemies to death with this vile stench?</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s confusion, the fox elder slowly began his explanation.</p> <p>The black thing was called a Black Pulp Melon. It not only had a vile stench, it would also explode when touched after it became mature. It would split into countless fragments, and it was incredibly rare.</p> <p>A few years ago, one of the members of the clan unintentionally brought back some sulfur from outside. The fox elder deemed it useless and threw it casually under a Black Pulp Melon tree. No one noticed anything strange at the start, but something surprising happened after the Black Pulp Melons matured.</p> <p>A few playful kids had been playing under the Black Pulp Melon tree. One of the kids picked a Black Pulp Melon and threw it at their friend. When it landed, the fruit blasted the kid’s leg off!</p> <p>After his shock, the fox elder realized that this was all caused by the sulfur. After the Black Pulp Melon tree absorbed the sulfur on the ground, the fruit it grew became larger and smelled worse. It also became more explosive when it matured. The more sulfur it absorbed, the more powerful the explosions became. If the blasts were concentrated, they could even be used to blast open large rocks.</p> <p>Bombs?</p> <p>Yang Ling was rather surprised as he looked at the dark, smelly Black Pulp Melon. He never expected that the Black Pulp Melon would be this powerful. He quickly estimated their value after he came to his senses.</p> <p>With a large number of Black Pulp Melons, he could rapidly open and pave roads with much less manpower. Perhaps he might even be able to expand the merchant route from Wissen Town to the Aila Mountain Pass in just a month.</p> <p>He could also start to conduct large-scale developments on the resources in the Terras Forest. He could open mines and gather ore, quickly obtaining a large amount of resources. Perhaps it would not take too long for him to build up the fortress at the Aila Mountain Pass and the port in Wissen Town.</p> <p>These melons would also allow him to set up hidden mines underground. He could even allow his flying Magical Beasts to attack targets on the ground from high up in the air, building a tactical bombing unit. Then, the defenses of his territory would reach unprecedented levels. The Banto people might find it hard to attack the Aila Mountain Pass even if they sent out an army of a hundred thousand Black Armor Guards.</p> <p>“Sir, we can test the power of the Black Pulp Melon outside!”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling deliberating for a long time, the fox elder had thought that Yang Ling did not believe him, so he was prepared to show Yang Ling the power of the Black Pulp Melons. For the prosperity of the tribe, for the future of his clansmen, it was all worth it.</p> <p>Coming to a vast field, the fox elder signalled for a guard to throw out the Black Pulp Melon. The melon blasted a tall tree into two sections. This proved that the power of the Black Pulp Melon was even more terrifying than Yang Ling had imagined. It was much more powerful than the bombs made by terrorists back on Earth.</p> <p>“Elder, give me a hundred Black Pulp Trees and two thousand Black Pulp Melons, and I’ll supply you with a thousand weapons and sets of armor!”</p> <p>How could Yang Ling bear to miss the opportunity after understanding the power of the Black Pulp Melon? The fruit were absolutely necessary, but he definitely had to have the Black Pulp Trees. With the Black Pulp Trees, he would naturally be able to obtain a large number of powerful Black Pulp Melons without being forced to depend on others in the future.</p> <p>A hundred Black Pulp Trees and two thousand Black Pulp Melons?</p> <p>The fox elder let out a bitter laugh as he shook his head. There were only ten Black Pulp Trees in the entire tribe, and only around twenty Black Pulp Melons left. They would not have to live constantly in worry of their tribe being attacked by other tribes if they had a large quantity of powerful Black Pulp Melons.</p> <p>“Sir, a two-hundred-year-old Black Pulp Tree can only bear a few dozen Black Pulp Melons a year under normal circumstances. We might not even be able to satisfy your request in a few years, much less in such a short span of time.” After hesitating for a moment, the fox elder gritted his teeth and continued, “Unless we obtained a large amount of sulfur to greatly boost the growth of the Black Pulp Trees.”</p> <p>Yang Ling quickly understood what was going on after the fox elder’s explanation.</p> <p>The Beastmen tribe only had a single mature Black Pulp Tree. The other nine trees were saplings that were only a few years old, their growth was incredibly slow. According to the historical records, a Black Pulp Tree could not reach full maturity unless given a few thousand years. Only at full maturity could it bear a large number of Black Pulp Melons.</p> <p>After long periods of research, the Beastmen had realized that sulfur could not only boost the power of the Black Pulp Melon, it could also boost the growth of Black Pulp Tree saplings. Unfortunately, the land in a thousand mile radius of the sulfur mine was dead and barren, with monsters crawling at every corner. As such, the tribe had been unable to do a large scale development with their current abilities.</p> <p>After turning past a small forest, the fox elder led Yang Ling to one of the rare Black Pulp Trees standing on a hill. There were many Dogmen defending the hill, in case any enemies infiltrated the tribe to harm the tree.</p> <p>Similar to the Black Pulp Melon, the Black Pulp Tree also had a vile stench. Yang Ling felt like vomiting despite being a few dozen steps away from the tree. He felt nothing but awe for the Dogmen warriors who stood near the tree, unfazed.</p> <p>Yang Ling fought back the urge to retch and walked forward, pretending to be casual as he stroked a sapling that was half the height of a person, secretly injecting a shred of life force into the plant. Indeed, the Black Pulp Tree had an immediate reaction, releasing a strange ripple. It was not too different from the Sapling of the Tree of Life that the elf tribe had gifted him.</p> <p>Setting up a Spirit Gathering Spell Formation and injecting life force from time to time would definitely speed up the growth of the plant by a few multiples!</p> <p>Yang Ling soon had an idea after making his way around the Black Pulp Trees a few times.</p> <p>“Sir, if you could supply us with two thousand sets of weapons and armor, we will gift you two saplings. How about that?” Seeing Yang Ling nod in satisfaction, the fox elder took the opportunity and voiced his request.</p> <p>“Elder, to tell you the truth, our steel ore is all imported from the distant Livenza Alliance. The cost is very high!” Yang Ling pretended to shake his head in frustration. “If you could give us the required steel ore, even three thousand sets would not be a problem, much less two thousand. Unfortunately…”</p> <p>After sighing and looking at the disappointed Beastmen, Yang Ling continued, “But if you could gift us the two-hundred-year-old Black Pulp Tree, I will sell the warhorses of my warriors and try my best to purchase enough steel ore to forge weapons for you!”</p> <p>Gift him the two-hundred-year-old Black Pulp Tree?</p> <p>Looking at each other, the dog elder and fox elder shook their heads in unison, rejecting Yang Ling’s request with determination. The Black Pulp Melons were their greatest weapon and secret. If not for the fact that they were severely lacking weapons, they would have been unwilling to even reveal this secret, much less offer to give Yang Ling the saplings of the Black Pulp Tree.</p> <p>“Three saplings, Sir. We cannot give you any more!”</p> <p>“I’ll take all nine of the saplings in exchange for two thousand weapons and sets of armor. In addition to that, I can give your tribe protection and support of various kinds. On my territory, Beastmen and humans have the same status and rights. I will protect your interests!”</p> <p>Seeing that there was no way that he could get the two-hundred-year-old Black Pulp Tree, Yang Ling asked for all nine of the saplings. Yang Ling believed that the saplings would grow quickly as long as he nurtured them with the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation. Perhaps he would be able to close the gap of two hundred years in just the short span of one month.</p> <p>Beastmen and humans will have the same status and rights?</p> <p>Yang Ling had just said this when the fox elder became excited. The Beastmen had always been discriminated against, either becoming slaves in big cities or hiding in the deep wilderness without status or dignity. If Yang Ling could give the Beastmen a fair status and rights, then it would be a huge blessing for all of the Beastmen.</p>",
  "Chapter 122: Sulfur Mine": "<p>After a little haggling, Yang Ling had obtained a full eight Black Pulp Tree saplings and ten Black Pulp Melons at a cost of two thousand weapons and sets of armor.</p> <p>In addition, with Yang Ling’s promise of fair treatment, the fox elder made preparations to move a portion of the clansmen to live permanently in Wissen Town, mainly the elderly and the kids. After all, the Ladak Mountain Range was a dangerous place to live.</p> <p>But Wissen Town was different. There was a large amount of undeveloped, arable land on the town’s outskirts. One would not have to worry about lacking rations for the winter as long as they were willing to put in the effort. With a large group of fierce warriors defending the town, the elder believed that not many would dare invade or rob them. It was much safer there than in the Ladak Mountain Range.</p> <p>“Sir, the saplings of the Black Pulp Tree grow slowly, but if you can find a large amount of sulfur, you might be able to harvest a few Black Pulp Melons in just a few years!” The fox elder reminded Yang Ling loudly. He was excited after having obtained a large amount of weapons and armor for the tribe, as well as having fought for a good home for his clansmen.</p> <p>“Didn’t you say that there is a sulfur mine nearby? Why must I look elsewhere?”</p> <p>Yang Ling was a little confused. Since there was a large sulfur mine nearby, why didn’t the Beastmen do a large scale excavation and nurture the slow-growing Black Pulp Trees?</p> <p>Could the Beastmen still be hiding some techniques when it came to the nurturing of the saplings?</p> <p>Seeing the eight precious saplings, then looking at the elated fox elder and dog elder, Yang Ling felt that this wasn’t the case. For the future of their clansmen and the prosperity of their tribe, the Beastmen had no desire to play around with Yang Ling.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s confusion, the fox elder let out a sigh and began to explain.</p> <p>It turned out that the Beastman tribe had only moved here from near the Aila Mountain Pass a few years ago. They had sent people to scout the surroundings when they had moved here and found the Taildon Valley, a place that looked sinister all year round. There was not only a large sulfur mine within the valley, there were also various rare crystals. Unfortunately, the place was teeming with monsters which made it hard for the scouts to delve too deeply into the area.</p> <p>“A few years ago, our tribe tried to head to the Taildon Valley, prepared to clear the area of monsters and Magical Beasts. To our dismay, of the three hundred people we sent, only a handful were lucky enough to return. Even a few warriors at the level of Great Swordsmen and Great Spellcasters met with misfortune. The power of our tribe fell drastically from then on!”</p> <p>The fox elder unbuttoned his shirt as he spoke. Yang Ling looked over to see a jagged scar at his chest. It looked as if it had been inflicted with a sharp blade, or the claw of some wild beast.</p> <p>Even a few Great Swordsmen and Great Spellcasters met with misfortune?</p> <p>Originally, Yang Ling had not paid too much attention to the Magical Beasts said to live in the Taildon Valley, but his expression turned serious when he learned of the Beastmen’s experience. A lone Great Swordsman or Great Spellcaster might not be too terrifying, but with the support of over three hundred warriors, a few Great Swordsmen and Great Spellcasters would also be able to unleash a tremendous battle prowess.</p> <p>“Sir, you must not enter the Taildon Valley rashly. There are corpses all around the valley. Who knows how many warriors and Spellcasters have died in there over the millennia!” The fox elder had a serious expression. “The thousand mile radius around the Taildon Valley is a land of death. According to my knowledge, there are even the remains of a few Sword Saints and Magical Tutors not far away from the entrance. You must not act rashly.”</p> <p>Even Sword Saints and Magical Tutors have fallen there?</p> <p>Yang Ling swallowed with difficulty. The abilities of a Great Swordsman were a far cry from those of a Sword Saint. If even a few Sword Saints and Magical Tutors had met with misfortune there, then the Magical Beasts of the Taildon Valley were too terrifying.</p> <p>Could it be that there are level eight, or even level nine Magical Beasts there?</p> <p>Yang Ling’s expression became serious when he recalled the terrifying Nine-headed Snake Monster. He might stand a chance against a level eight Magical Beast, but if there was a level nine Magical Beast in the area, then he had to run as far as he could. Rashly entering the valley would be like a moth fluttering to a flame, inviting his own death.</p> <p>“According to our deductions, other than a large group of intermediate level Magical Beasts, there is at least an advanced level eight or higher Magical Beast in the Taildon Valley!” Clenching on the staff in his hand and recalling the pitiful battle he had fought in, the fox elder had a bleak expression. “Do not even think about moving as you wish within the valley unless you are a Sage level expert. If we had a Sage level expert, the Beastmen would not be as we are today, without status or dignity!”</p> <p>The expressions of the surrounding Beastmen turned dull, some even tearing up on the spot when the term “Sage level expert” was brought up. Over the millennia, all the races with large populations, from the humans to the Orcs, had possessed Sage level warriors or Spellcasters. Only the Beastmen had none to speak of.</p> <p>In order to change the plight of their clansmen, countless Beastmen had trained manically. But neither the intelligent Foxmen, the powerful Bullmen, or any of the others had managed to reach the level of Sword Saint or Magical Tutor. The humans and Orcs had many powerful fighters, but the Beastmen were unable to change their powerlessness.</p> <p>Over the millennia, Sage level had become an unattainable dream!</p> <p>In order to one day break through their limitations, many Beastmen had tolerated the humiliation and lived on stubbornly. Unfortunately, even after millennia had passed, none of the Beastmen could break through the barrier high above.</p> <p>“A few thousand years ago, the powerful Orcs ruled over most of the land on the continent, and the humans could only proliferate in the wilderness. But ever since the powerful Church appeared for the humans and gave rise to several Sage level experts, everything changed!”</p> <p>The fox elder’s tone was dull as he slowly talked about the legends recorded in the history books.</p> <p>The Church of Light had suddenly appeared on the continent a few thousand years ago, bringing with it a batch of fanatic worshippers and powerful missionaries. No one knew the background of the Church. No one knew what secrets the Church was hiding.</p> <p>The Church sent a large number of Sage level fighters on a killing spree when they first appeared, helping the humans break out of the Orcs’ control, engaging in a war of epic proportions with the powerful Orcs.</p> <p>In the war, the destructive power of Sage level warriors was incredibly terrifying. Both Sage level warriors and Sage level Spellcasters could kill off tens of thousands of the enemy forces in an instant. In the later stages of the war, the Orc empire also had someone advance to Sage level. Only then did they manage to achieve a ceasefire with the greedy humans.</p> <p>“Oh, then there are still several Sage level experts left on the continent?” Yang Ling was not concerned about the fleeting legends; he was only interested in finding out just how many Sage level experts were left in the world today.</p> <p>After taking in a deep breath, the fox elder said, “It is rumored that there are at least three Sage levels in the world today. The Banto Empire’s Sage level Spellcaster Saint Lucia, the Rossi Empire’s Sage level Swordsman Naistro, and the Orc King from the Orc Empire. It is rumored that the Pope of the Church has also reached Sage level, and might even be more terrifying than the average Sage level fighter!”</p> <p>Saint Lucia, Naistro, the Orc King, the Pope… Yang Ling was silent, but he was secretly committing the names and identities of these people to memory.</p> <p>Perhaps he would also be able to obtain the powers of the Sage level after training to the level of Soul Wizard or Wizard Deity!</p> <p>Yang Ling believed that the Wizard Techniques he was cultivating were not the same as the magical spells or Battle Energy that existed in this world. In fact, it might even be much more powerful and mysterious. As long as he pressed on, Sage level might not be as far away as he imagined.</p> <p>Even though he knew that the Taildon Valley was fraught with danger, Yang Ling did not give up. He instructed his army to quickly head to the Taildon Valley some ten miles away after bidding his farewells to the fox elder.</p> <p>The power of the Black Pulp Melons was too alluring. In order to hasten the growth of the Black Pulp Tree saplings and build his own powerful tactical bombing unit, Yang Ling had decided to take the gamble.</p> <p>Even though it was the height of the afternoon, the Taildon Valley was still sinister and chilly. A thick black cloud covered the sky above the valley, ever-changing. From far away, it looked like a giant mushroom cloud, but up close, it looked like a ferocious wild beast.</p> <p>As they drew closer to the Taildon Valley, fewer wild beasts roamed the area, and the temperature dropped. Even though they were dressed in thick coats, the elf archers frequently shivered in the cold. Even the muscular barbarians were no exception.</p> <p>“Master, the place before us is very dangerous. Be careful!”</p> <p>With his natural instincts, the Twin-headed Ogre Braska felt an impending danger as he walked quickly toward Yang Ling. He raised his giant club and walked behind Yang Ling. Ever since Yang Ling had arranged for the old and weak Ogres to be sent back to Wissen Town, Braska had become more loyal. He would have served Yang Ling even if his soul had not been under Yang Ling’s control.</p> <p>“Argus, send out five more scouts. We must understand the situation outside the Taildon Valley within four hours!” Yang Ling said as he summoned his Magical Beast army.</p> <p>For some reason, he had a feeling of unease. The Horned Bee Beasts felt drained after flying two miles forward, and the images they sent back were becoming increasingly hazy, as if something was blocking the mental powers that he was releasing.</p> <p>Yang Ling felt even more uneasy the closer he got to Taildon Valley. The effective range between him and the Horned Bee Beasts dropped from two miles to a mere eight hundred meters. He also had the feeling that he was being watched, as if some monster was coldly observing his every action. That feeling was akin to having a merciless poisonous snake latch on to his arm, impossible to shake off.</p> <p>Did he have no choice but to give up halfway?</p> <p>Catching a whiff of the increasingly thicker scent of sulfur in the air, looking at the trembling Gnomes and nervous elf archers, then looking at the uneasy Magical Beast army that had instinctively sensed danger, Yang Ling could not help but hesitate.</p> <p>The sulfur was important, but it wasn’t worth suffering heavy casualties!</p> <p>Without the Magical Beast army, he did not dare imagine how bad the situation in Wissen Town would become. Even the Rossi Empire might be tempted to attack, much less the Banto Empire that hadn’t given up. In fact, even the troops and adventurers in Wissen Town might have other intentions.</p> <p>There are no permanent friends in the world, only permanent interests!</p> <p>Today, the Rossi Empire was working with him to deal with the Banto Empire; tomorrow, they might stab him in the back. Today, Harribell was providing him with immense support, but if he were to suffer heavy casualties and lose control over Wissen Town, she might turn around and leave. In fact, even the elf archers and barbarians would leave him if he was at the end of his rope.</p> <p>He could only truly count on the Magical Beasts he had tamed! Yang Ling understood that until he trained himself to a high level, the Magical Beast army would be his greatest asset. He could not allow them to suffer heavy casualties.</p>",
  "Chapter 123: Giant Crab Spider": "<p>After a moment’s deliberation, thinking about the powerful Black Pulp Melon, Yang Ling decided to take the gamble. He clenched his teeth and instructed the army to walk slowly toward the Taildon Valley.</p> <p>The Ogre army took the front and the Gargoyles covered his back. The Horned Bee Beasts hovered low in the air, responsible for providing the army with cover. The rest of the troops formed a tight circular defensive formation. With caution in every step, they walked forward.</p> <p>The entrance to the valley was wide, but there were rocks of various shapes strewn around. With the steep cliffs on both sides, it looked exceptionally narrow and pressing.</p> <p>Compared to the outside, the inside of the valley was darker and colder. Even Yang Ling trembled in the cold, much less the elf archers and their weaker constitution. If the area outside the valley was chilly, then the area within could be described as outright sinister and cold.</p> <p>The cold air penetrated their thick coats like a venomous snake, entering the body through every pore. It was chilly straight to the bone. Their limbs were numb, their scalps aching. It was as if even their souls were about to be frozen solid, much less their blood.</p> <p>The group had just walked a few steps when a strange sound came from deep within the valley. It sounded like the roar of the wind, but also like the howls of a wild beast. The sound glided past the hearts of everyone like the cold wind.</p> <p>“Sir, why don’t we come back after we have gathered all of the warriors?”</p> <p>Argus looked nervously at the serious Yang Ling, gripping his longsword tightly, incredibly nervous. He recalled the various legends that he had heard about in the past. He frequently looked around in fear, paranoid.</p> <p>“Yes yes yes! Sir, why don’t we head outside first!” The Gnome Elder agreed loudly with Argus. For some reason, he had a very bad feeling, as if the dark sky was going to fall on them at any time.</p> <p>“Having too many people isn’t always a good thing!” Yang Ling said after a moment’s deliberation. “With our abilities, we might be able to hold our own against a level eight, or even a level nine Magical Beast. Even if we are unable to win, we should at least be able to retreat safely. There’s nothing to be scared of. But remember, do not leave the formation. You must not act rashly!”</p> <p>Even though the valley was much more sinister than he had expected, Yang Ling was unwilling to give up now that he was already here. He had a feeling that in addition to the large sulfur mine, he might even find many rare treasures if he persisted on.</p> <p>According to the reports of his scouts, both the inside and outside of the Taildon Valley was covered with mountains. They had not been able to see the end of the valley even after travelling over two hours on a fast horse. No one knew just how long this eerie valley was.</p> <p>With Yang Ling’s consolation, the group lifted their spirits and pressed on. Along the way, they saw incomplete skeletons from time to time, some missing limbs, others only left with a skull. Under the heavy cloud cover, the skeletons scattered on the ground only reflected bits of light, making them even more sinister and scary.</p> <p>The group advanced slowly as they observed the surrounding terrain closely. They sent out a large number of scouts and Horned Bee Beasts, in case they suddenly got attacked by enemies. Along the way, they picked up anything that was of value.</p> <p>After journeying for an hour, the smell of sulfur in the air became stronger. They were probably not too far away from the sulfur mine now. They did not encounter any monsters along the way, but they did manage to pick up many things near the various skeletons. There were sharp swords, heavy armor, and grimy crystal coins. Other than that, there were also several staffs and weird items.</p> <p>Grabbing a black staff that an Ogre had passed back to him, Yang Ling had no expression, but he felt incredibly shocked. He could feel a massive Magical Energy within this pitch black staff. Looking at the intricate patterns on the staff, he finally believed the words of the fox elder.</p> <p>Other than ordinary Swordsmen and Spellcasters, there were also several Great Swordsmen and Great Spellcasters who had lost their lives in the Taildon Valley. In fact, there were even powerful Sword Saints and Magical Tutors!</p> <p>When a scout sent back a Space Ring, Yang Ling was both excited and incredibly nervous. Space Rings were incredibly rare on the continent. Ordinarily, only the rich and noble would wear Space Rings. Under normal circumstances, only Spellcasters who had reached the level of Magical Tutor would have the abilities to keep a Space Ring safe.</p> <p>What kind of monster could cause even powerful fighters like Magical Tutors or Sword Saints to die here?</p> <p>The farther they headed inside and the more treasures they picked up, the more nervous Yang Ling got. At the same time, it might have been just a hallucination, but he felt the sensation of being watched become stronger and stronger. In fact, he could faintly hear waves of icy laughter filled with disdain. The pagoda-shaped mark at the center of his brows became hotter and hotter, slowly starting to throb.</p> <p>Chitter…</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was still hesitating on whether to retreat immediately, the Tarantula King suddenly screamed maniacally, instructing the spider army to stay cautious.</p> <p>“Not good! Quick, close in the formation, quick!”</p> <p>Even though he did not know what danger the Tarantula King had sensed, Yang Ling did not dare hesitate, quickly closing in the formation. The Evil Eyes that had weak defences stayed in the center, while the powerful Withered Tree Warriors and Ogres acted as shields. They formed a tight circular defensive formation.</p> <p>After receiving the order, the scouts quickly returned to the formation. The barbarians who were further away also rushed toward them with all their strength. But they had just made it within twenty steps of the main formation and were heaving sighs of relief when disaster suddenly struck!</p> <p>Several sharp spines suddenly appeared from under the ground, immediately impaling the defenseless scouts. The sharp, oval-shaped spines pierced into their chests, punching through their spines before emerging from their backs.</p> <p>After the successful attack, a large horde of basin-sized spiders crawled out from under the ground and split into two groups.</p> <p>One team charged toward the group fiercely, their two pincers opening and closing with a cold gleam. They shot out a smelly poisonous liquid from far away, their range greater than the spider army led by the Tarantula King. The other team dug underground in groups, launching many sharp spikes from the earth.</p> <p>“Oh god, Giant Crab Spiders! Sir, retreat, retreat quickly!”</p> <p>Seeing the horde of spiders approaching him, seeing the earth spikes swarm toward him like the tide, the Gnome Elder lost his color in shock. The clansmen behind him shivered in fear.</p> <p>It was rumored that the Giant Crab Spiders were magical creatures that came from Hell in groups. They not only had immense strength, fatal poison, and sharp claws, they could also dig underground and launch terrifying Earth Spikes, leaving no way to escape.</p> <p>Giant Crab Spiders?</p> <p>Seeing the Giant Crab Spiders that seemed to be the evolved versions of the Red-haired Tarantula, Yang Ling swallowed with difficulty. Sharp claws, blanketing poison, massive numbers, and those terrifying Earth Spikes… It was no wonder that the Beastmen had suffered heavy casualties. It was no wonder that corpses lined the valley.</p> <p>“Retreat, all of you retreat, quickly!”</p> <p>After his shock, Yang Ling reacted quickly. He was prepared to send the Gargoyles to cover his back and instruct his army to retreat urgently. But he had just said this when Giant Crab Spiders dug out from all around him. He was surrounded in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>With no choice left, Yang Ling could only instruct his army to defend themselves where they stood!</p> <p>Violently charging forward, a dozen Ogres had not even managed to kill a few Giant Crab Spiders when they fell to the combined effects of the other party’s poison and Earth Spikes. The sharp Earth Spikes pierced through the soles of their feet, and the fatal poison corroded their muscles and bones, instantly reducing them into piles of bloody gore.</p> <p>Under the command of the Evil Eye Tyrant, the Evil Eye army unleashed a wave of strong light. But disappointingly, perhaps due to the unique structure of the Giant Crab Spiders’ eyes or because they had reacted too quickly, the attack didn’t have much of an effect.</p> <p>Faced with the horde of Giant Crab Spiders and their terrifying poison, the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles had no way of getting close to them. Because of their limited range, the spider army led by the Tarantula King was also useless in this situation. Only the Evil Eye army retaliated with all their might under the command of the Evil Eye Tyrant, trying their best to hold off the tidal-like attack of the enemy.</p> <p>At Yang Ling’s command, the Unicorn also unleashed bolts of snake-shaped lightning, attacking the sieging Giant Crab Spiders. Unfortunately, there were just too many Giant Crab Spiders. There was no end to their swarm, so Yang Ling’s army simply could not kill enough of them.</p> <p>As the attacking army of Giant Crab Spiders increased and advanced, the Ogres and barbarians in the outer circle all got struck by their attacks. Some got hit by the acidic poison. They were unable to shake off the substance, and small holes appeared on them in the blink of an eye. Some were propped up above the ground by the sharp Earth Spines, their limbs twitching as their bodies became covered in blood.</p> <p>What do I do?</p> <p>Seeing the acidic poison blanketing them, Yang Ling became covered in sweat. If he was alone, he might have been able to escape quickly using the fast Unicorn. If he only had the Magical Beast army beside him, he could have recalled them into the Wizard’s Pagoda before escaping, but what was he going to do with the rest of the barbarians, elves, Ogres, and Gnomes?</p> <p>The waves of Earth Spikes, the acidic poison that could cut through heavy shields… Faced with the massive numbers of Giant Crab Spiders, the group lost their color in shock. The poison was even more terrifying than the Earth Spikes. It could penetrate anything.</p> <p>At the critical moment, the ones that saved the army were not the cannon-like Evil Eyes or the fighter jet-like Horned Bee Beasts, but the Gnomes who had always been used as bait, the cowardly, insignificant Gnomes!</p> <p>Under the command of the Gnome Elder, several Gnome Spellcasters quickly flipped open an earth element spell formation, joining hands as they activated a powerful of earth element barrier ring, blocking the blanketing poison of the Giant Crab Spiders.</p> <p>Hisssss…</p> <p>A piercing sound could be heard when the blanketing poison of the Giant Crab Spiders fell on the protective barrier, releasing bales of thick white smoke. It was jarring to watch.</p> <p>“Sir, the attacks of the Giant Crab Spiders are too concentrated! The protective barrier will only last an hour at the very most. You have to find a way out as soon as possible!”</p> <p>After catching his breath, the Gnome Elder reminded Yang Ling fearfully. He could not imagine how they were going to defend themselves against the powerful attacks of the Giant Crab Spiders after the protective barrier lost its effectiveness.</p> <p>“Hmph, an hour is more than enough. It is enough for me to kill them all!”</p> <p>Seeing the Giant Crab Spiders advancing toward them, Yang Ling had decided to take a gamble. He was going to wait until the hordes of Giant Crab Spiders charged over before instructing the Evil Eyes and spider army to unleash a strong counterattack.</p> <p>Without the threat of the poison, the counterattack of the Evil Eyes and the spider army swept across the sieging enemies. The Giant Crab Spiders were all killed before they could even dig into the ground.</p>",
  "Chapter 124: A Different Magical Energy": "<p>The protective barrier was magical. People inside could attack the enemies outside, but the enemies outside could not penetrate the barrier. To the enemies outside, other than breaking the protective barrier with a powerful force, all they could do was launch sustained attacks to deplete the energy of the barrier.</p> <p>Without anything holding them back, the Evil Eyes and spider army retaliated with full force. As they had a higher range, the Evil Eyes were mainly responsible for attacking the Giant Crab Spiders that were a dozen steps away, their concentrated beams of light never stopping. The spider army was responsible for attacking the Giant Crab Spiders within ten steps from them. Even though their poison was not as terrifying as that of their opponents, they managed to clear large areas of their enemies with their numbers alone.</p> <p>After their poison was blocked by the protective barrier, all the Giant Crab Spiders could do was dig into the ground and attack using their Earth Spikes. But since the effective range of the Earth Spikes was about the same as the Evil Eyes’, there was no way for them to attack Yang Ling’s army. They had just crawled out of the ground and were prepared to shift a few steps forward when they were quickly picked off by the Evil Eyes.</p> <p>Against the fierce attacks of the Evil Eyes and spider army, the Giant Crab Spiders suffered heavy casualties. Soon, their bodies covered the ground, blood flowing like a river. But for some reason, perhaps it due to their bestial qualities, they continued charging toward Yang Ling like moths to a flame, unafraid of death.</p> <p>“Sir, the protective barrier will not last much longer. What are we going to do?”</p> <p>Seeing the protective barrier about to shatter, while there seemed to be no end to the hordes of Giant Crab Spiders, the Gnome Elder became pale in anxiety. Faced with the near-endless Giant Crab Spiders, faced with their terrifying Earth Spikes and poison, the outcome would be disastrous if they did not have the defensive barrier.</p> <p>The number of Giant Crab Spiders was much greater than the group had expected! Could it be that they had been unlucky enough to stumble into a giant spider nest?</p> <p>Clenching his teeth, Yang Ling tossed out a Wizard Amulet and blasted a Giant Crab Spider away. “Is there a way to sustain the protective barrier? Quick, tell me!”</p> <p>“Magical Energy, we need a large amount of Magical Energy!” The Gnome Elder had a glint in his eyes and continued, “We can sustain the protective barrier as long as we can inject it with a large amount of Magical Energy!”</p> <p>A large amount of Magical Energy?</p> <p>Seeing the Gnome Spellcasters who had no Magical Energy within them and could only cast spells using spell formations, Yang Ling shook his head in frustration. There were many people in his army, but they did not have any Spellcasters. If Goode was present, he could use his abilities as a Great Spellcaster to provide them with a glimmer of hope, but unfortunately…</p> <p>Chitter…</p> <p>Despite the heavy casualties, the Giant Crab Spiders continued to attack using their massive numbers, enormously depleting the energy of the protective barrier. The protective barrier became thinner and thinner, and seemed about to crumble under the blanketing poison. Drops of the terrifying poison even began to leak from some parts of the barrier.</p> <p>The turtle shell-like protective barrier was about to crumble!</p> <p>“Sir, charge out quickly! The Ogres will open a path, and I’ll cover your back with the barbarians!” Seeing the situation become more and more dire, Argus asked for permission, prepared to go all out.</p> <p>Should we flee?</p> <p>Seeing the shivering Gnomes, then looking at the endless horde of Giant Crab Spiders around them, Yang Ling shook his head in frustration. At this point in time, he finally understood why even powerful fighters like Swords Saints and Magical Tutors would die here.</p> <p>To a Sword Saint or a Magical Tutor, a single Giant Crab Spider was insignificant. They could finish it off with one move. But it would be completely different if they were surrounded by a thousand, ten thousand, or even a hundred thousand Giant Crab Spiders.</p> <p>If there were enough ants, even an elephant could be eaten alive!</p> <p>If Magical Beast Essence Crystals can be used to set up Wizard Formations just like other crystals, then can Wizard Power be converted into the so called Magical Energy?</p> <p>Seeing the limbs of the Giant Crab Spiders fly off under the intense counterattacks of the Evil Eyes, with peanut-sized Essence Crystals even dropping out, Yang Ling suddenly came up with an idea.</p> <p>Seeing the fearful elf archers and warriors beside him, then looking at the manic Giant Crab Spiders, he decided to make a last attempt and injected the Wizard Power in his body into the protective barrier.</p> <p>The protective barrier shuddered slightly when it touched Yang Ling’s Wizard Power, releasing a faint red glow. It even seemed to let out a quiet hum.</p> <p>Seeing that there was some effect, Yang Ling hesitated no longer and manically infused the Wizard Power in his body into the protective barrier. In that moment, the protective barrier shone with a red light, trembling as it released a blood red radiance, defending against the attacks of the Giant Crab Spiders.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling display his abilities and support the entire protective barrier all by himself, the Evil Eye Tyrant and Tarantula King had a boost in morale, each of them instructing their armies to retaliate with all their might. The Evil Eye Tyrant released continuous exploding bombs, focusing its attacks on the leaders of the Giant Crab Spiders, dissolving their attacking power and morale.</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>After letting out a strange cry, the Giant Spiders advanced instead of retreating, charging toward them, unafraid of death. It looked like they were prepared to exhaust all of the Wizard Power in Yang Ling’s body.</p> <p>This is a battle of willpower!</p> <p>Yang Ling did not hold back, continuously infusing his Wizard Power into the protective barrier, occasionally taking out Magical Beast Blood Orbs to replenish his expended Wizard Power. But despite that, the amount he replenished could not compare to the Wizard Power he was expending.</p> <p>What do I do? Am I about to be exhausted to death?</p> <p>Seeing the countless Giant Crab Spiders swarming toward him, endless, Yang Ling creased his brows as he understood that he could not continue doing this. There were not many Magical Beast Blood Orbs left in his Space Ring. He could not last much longer.</p> <p>Wait… Magical Beast Blood Essence?</p> <p>Thinking about the few Magical Beast Blood Orbs he had left, then looking at the fresh blood of the Giant Crab Spiders flowing continuously toward him, Yang Ling came up with a crazy idea.</p> <p>Without hesitation, he multitasked. He infused what was left of his Wizard Power into the protective barrier as he used his Wizard Techniques to concentrate the fresh blood of the Giant Crab Spiders flowing toward him into orbs of blood before devouring them to replenish the Wizard Power he expended.</p> <p>The Gnome Elder, Argus, and the rest quickly understood Yang Ling’s intentions, and they worked together to dig small tunnels and direct the blood of the Giant Crab Spiders to Yang Ling’s side.</p> <p>Streaks of blood vapors were produced as the Magical Beast Blood Orbs concentrated. Soon, a thick fog of blood had gathered around Yang Ling, covering his entire body.</p> <p>Just like that, Yang Ling had managed to sustain the massive magical protective barrier by himself. Under the protection of the defensive barrier, the Evil Eyes, spiders, and elf archers retaliated with all their effort, killing the Giant Crab Spiders swarming toward them. The Giant Crab Spiders who were unafraid of death continued pouncing forward like moths to a flame, before getting killed and indirectly supplying Yang Ling with medicine to nourish himself.</p> <p>Slowly, after realizing that the Giant Crab Spiders could not succeed in their attack, Yang Ling decided to train where he stood and search for the secrets behind the protective barrier.</p> <p>He injected a shred of Wizard Power, then injected a shred of green life force…</p> <p>Emptying his mind, he soon began to understand the secrets of the protective barrier. Slowly, Yang Ling became more efficient, expending less Wizard Power and life force while making the protective barrier more powerful. It turned from the original red color to a combination of red and green light. The poison of the Giant Crab Spiders no longer had that great of an effect.</p> <p>Some time later, just as the Evil Eye army was about to expend the last of its Magical Energy and stamina, there were no longer any Giant Crab Spiders swarming out of the distance. Under the combined attacks of the spider army and the elf archers, the number of Giant Crab Spiders surrounding the protective barrier also decreased.</p> <p>Chitter…</p> <p>After they had suffered heavy casualties and their corpses had piled up high, the Giant Crab Spiders finally came to their senses. All of them retreated under the orders of a calf-sized Giant Crab Spider.</p> <p>The Giant Crab Spiders retreated like the tide, but it was too late!</p> <p>Knowing that the enemy had lost the will to fight, Yang Ling ordered the army to attack quickly. The Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles who had been held back charged forward like lightning. The violent Ogres and barbarians were unwilling to lose out, and even the naturally cowardly Gnomes charged forward, screaming.</p> <p>Unleashing their bestial qualities, the Horned Bee Beasts flew low, angrily shooting out their fatal poisonous stingers, attacking the fleeing Giant Crab Spiders. The Gargoyles were even crueler, charging down from the sky and grabbing the Giant Crab Spiders up before tearing them in two, raining their blood down from the sky.</p> <p>With the Horned Bee Beasts and Gargoyles blocking their path, the rest of the Giant Crab Spiders turned around and tried to escape in all directions. Unfortunately, the Magical Beast army was already enraged, and they weren’t about to let the spiders off.</p> <p>With no way to escape, some of the Giant Crab Spiders were crushed to a pulp by the bloodthirsty Ogres, some were shot to the ground by the elf archers’ arrows, and some were smashed to a paste by the ten-meter-tall Withered Tree Warriors…</p> <p>In just an hour, the Taildon Valley became covered with the corpses of the Giant Crab Spiders and their blood. According to a preliminary count, at least fifty thousand Giant Crab Spiders had died by the hands of the army.</p> <p>Fifty thousand Giant Crab Spiders. They had probably cleaned up most of the Giant Crab Spiders in this valley. Even if there were any survivors, they would no longer be able to create any trouble in the future.</p> <p>After the battle and a serious count, Yang Ling had lost a total of eighty Ogres, twenty barbarians, and fifty spiders. Even though this loss was unprecedented, it was insignificant compared to the countless number lost by the Giant Crab Spiders.</p> <p>Other than those who had lost their lives, there were also a large number of warriors and Magical Beasts that were injured. But most of them survived after some emergency treatment. As long as the Magical Beasts could still breathe, they would slowly recover when recalled into the Wizard’s Pagoda.</p> <p>Heaving a sigh of relief, Yang Ling sat cross-legged, protected by a team of Horned Bee Beasts. He observed closely the changes in the spiders’ bodies as they devoured the Essence Crystals of the Giant Crab Spiders scattered on the ground.</p> <p>The Essence Crystals of the Giant Crab Spiders were not large and might not sell for too much outside, but to the spider army, they were rich and precious nourishment. In their excitement, the tarantulas even tore the corpses of the Giant Crab Spiders into shreds and swallowed their Essence Crystals together with the flesh. Even the Tarantula King was no exception.</p> <p>After consuming a massive amount of Magical Beast Blood Orbs, Yang Ling noticed that the Wizard Power in his body had become more massive. The power of the Wizard Amulet he activated was now much stronger than before. He had only been able to command the Horned Bee Beasts within a five-hundred-meter radius when he first stepped into the valley, but now he could easily increase the distance to a thousand meters. It seemed as though his abilities had doubled.</p> <p>Perhaps he would be able to arrive at the level of Earth Wizard and concentrate his Wizard Core with just a little more effort?</p> <p>Yang Ling was very excited when he examined his body. According to the explanation of the stele, one would be able to truly grasp the essence of Wizard Techniques when they concentrated the Wizard Core and slowly start to wield stranger, more mysterious Wizard powers.</p>",
  "Chapter 125: Cocoon-like Evolution": "<p>After consuming a large amount of Giant Crab Spider Essence Crystals, the tarantulas started to envelop themselves using their webs. Layer after layer, they formed an olive-shaped spider cocoon, then hid inside, motionless.</p> <p>Oh, cocoon-like evolution?</p> <p>Through the Tarantula King’s memories, Yang Ling knew that the spiders were evolving after consuming a large amount of Giant Crab Spider Essence Crystals. If everything was successful, they would emerge from the cocoons a few days later and reach the fourth level, and also obtain new abilities.</p> <p>Super long range poison, indefensible Earth Spikes…</p> <p>Thinking back to the Giant Crab Spiders’ abilities, Yang Ling was full of anticipation for the spider army’s evolution. If the spiders could obtain abilities like the Giant Crab Spiders after their evolution, they would truly be a trump card and become his main force in land battles.</p> <p>Seeing the spider cocoons neatly lined up, Yang Ling sent the Gargoyles and a team of Horned Bee Beasts to guard them after a moment’s deliberation, in case the spider army suffered from a sudden attack whilst they were evolving. According to the memories of the Tarantula King, they were weakest when they were undergoing the cocoon-like evolution. They would be unable to retaliate if they were to suffer an attack.</p> <p>After choosing a place to act as his outpost and setting up his defenses, Yang Ling decided to organize an elite team of scouts. He personally led the team and rapidly scoured the entire area of the Taildon Valley.</p> <p>As expected, they discovered a large sulfur mine after just advancing two miles forward. Several Giant Crab Spider eggs were scattered near the mine, and a few young Giant Crab Spiders could be seen crawling around. It looked like the now-exterminated Giant Crab Spiders had set up their nest in the mine, living on the sulfur that the Beastmen had dreamed of possessing.</p> <p>“Sir, are we still going to walk forward?”</p> <p>The Twin-headed Ogre Braska swallowed with difficulty. The rising stench of the sulfur made him want to retch. If he could choose, he would rather engage in battle with the Giant Crab Spiders than stand here and breathe in the odor of rotten eggs.</p> <p>On the other side of the sulfur mine was a large field of rocks of various sizes, with no end in sight. No one knew exactly how long the Taildon Valley was. No one knew what kind of monster they would encounter if they continued forward.</p> <p>The Ogres and barbarians were strong, but they were not skilled in climbing. Asking them to scout past the vast rocks would definitely put them in a difficult spot.</p> <p>The elf archers were nimble and they were much better climbers than the Ogres and barbarians, but their abilities at close combat were poor. They would definitely die if they suddenly encountered monsters. They also had poor stamina and could not sprint for long periods of time, and thus they were unsuitable to scout any further.</p> <p>If the elf archers were not suitable, then the cowardly Gnomes were even less so. They could act as bait for the army, but it was definitely too much to ask them to be scouts.</p> <p>The Gargoyles were fast and had powerful attacks, but unfortunately, they could not fly for long periods of time. Their overly large wings would also be easily spotted. After some calculations, Yang Ling decided the slender Horned Bee Beasts were the most suitable to scout such a complicated area.</p> <p>Leading the team back to the outpost, Yang Ling ordered Argus to send men to the nearby Beastmen tribe and ask them to send a team of warriors over to help with the defenses. He also sent someone back to Wissen Town to notify Goode and ask him to hurry over with a few Spellcasters.</p> <p>The path to Wissen Town from Taildon Valley was not very long, only about five hundred miles from beginning to end. But the mountainous path was winding, and the journey was definitely much longer than if he was heading to the Aila Mountain Pass. Personally setting up his own team to develop the sulfur mine here was definitely not cost effective, being both time and labor intensive. The best way would be for him to give the Beastmen some rewards and allow them to partake in the activity.</p> <p>They had not finished exploring the Taildon Valley. Even if there were no Magical Beasts or monsters deep within the valley, Yang Ling still needed an army to guard the sulfur mine, in case the nearby aboriginal tribes took the opportunity to attack.</p> <p>A unit was required for the long term defense of the Aila Mountain Pass, Wissen Town had to be guarded by one unit, and Yang Ling had personally led a unit to clear and conquer the aboriginal tribes near the Ladak Mountain Range. There were no additional men he could station at the Taildon Valley to defend it. Wissen Town currently had limited wealth, so they could not afford to recruit another unit.</p> <p>Thus, the best idea was to offer the Beastmen some incentives and drag them into this. As long as he maneuvered the situation expertly, not only would the safety of the sulfur be guaranteed, he might even obtain a large amount of nearly free labor.</p> <p>In order to completely occupy Taildon Valley, he had to have powerful Spellcasters. Yang Ling did not wish to be caught off guard and take a passive position when he was met with another Giant Crab Spider attack. The Gnomes had surpassed their limits and saved them once, but there was no guarantee that they would be able to turn the tide a second time. Thus, even though Yang Ling knew that Goode had many tasks at hand, he still had no choice but to bring him here.</p> <p>Perhaps, when he had enough funds, it would be time for him to recruit a few more Spellcasters!</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged while guarded by the Unicorn, Yang Ling considered his future plans. After the battle, he had once again learned more about the magical spells of this world. He felt that even though spells were not as powerful as his Wizard Techniques, one could still attain powerful abilities when they cultivated Magical Energy to high levels.</p> <p>Thinking about the repeated spell formations of the Gnomes, Yang Ling shook his head and heaved a sigh of regret.</p> <p>Just like the Wizard Techniques, Spellcasters in this world couldn’t achieve greatness instantly. They had to cultivate their techniques one step at a time. Originally, the unique spell formations of the Gnomes had offered another perspective, able to instantly create a Spellcaster. But the failure rate of drawing the spell formations was too high, making them impossible to mass produce. He would not be able to depend on them to create a magical army that could handle both offense and defense in a short amount of time.</p> <p>After shaking his head, Yang Ling prepared to circulate the Wizard Power in his body and instruct the Horned Bee Beasts to explore the area. Unexpectedly, he had just taken a breath when the Gnome Elder walked toward him quickly.</p> <p>“Sir, the members of my clan once again sent word that if they have run out of rations, and most of the people will not be able to last until tomorrow. Sir, can you…”</p> <p>The Gnome Elder creased his brows, his eyes red. At this point in time, only Yang Ling could save his tribe. Without rations, his clansmen would not be able to last any longer.</p> <p>“Elder, I already instructed my people to send rations over!” After a pause, seeing the Gnome Elder’s eyes light up, Yang Ling continued, “But the snow is heavy, and the road there is far and filled with twists and turns. Even I cannot guarantee that my warriors can send over the rations by today!”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling shake his head in frustration, the Gnome Elder’s heart turned cold. The snow was getting heavier, and the speed of the carriages was becoming slower. No one could guarantee that the rations could be sent over in time!</p> <p>What can I do? Will the tribe end under my leadership? thought the elder.</p> <p>He thought about his clansmen waiting in the cold wind, about the group of skinny old men and children, about their only hope when he left the tribe… The Gnome Elder felt his limbs turn cold, his heart sinking deeper.</p> <p>“Elder, I cannot guarantee that the warriors transporting the rations will be able to reach them by tonight, but that is not to say that there are no choices left!” Yang Ling said as he took out the Space Ring he had picked up in the valley. “Get a shipment of rations from Argus, then rush back to your tribe on a fast horse!”</p> <p>A Space Ring?</p> <p>Seeing the extremely costly Space Ring, the Gnome Elder teared up in agitation. He had not expected Yang Ling to hand him such a valuable treasure without hesitation.</p> <p>“Also, move all of your clansmen into Wissen Town over the next few days!” After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling drew a few circles on the ground with a small pebble. “Next year, I’ll develop a large area of arable land in the territory. I shall give this portion of the land to the Gnome tribe!”</p> <p>A ten mile, twenty mile radius?</p> <p>Seeing the large circle Yang Ling had drawn casually, then comparing it to the size of Wissen Town drawn on the ground, the Gnome Elder nearly floated in elation. He had never expected Yang Ling to allow his entire tribe to move into Wissen Town this soon, nor had he expected Yang Ling to grant his tribe such a large area of premium land.</p> <p>“Thank you sir, the Gnome Tribe will forever follow you from this day onward, and we will serve you with all our abilities!” The Gnome Elder knelt respectfully before Yang Ling.</p> <p>“I saw the Gnomes’ intelligence and bravery in the previous battle!” Yang Ling helped the Gnome Elder up. “Go, and return quickly after you’ve settled your clansmen!”</p> <p>Remembering his hungry clansmen, the Gnome Elder did not say anything more and left quickly after giving a respectful bow. He asked Argus for some supplies, then returned to his tribe on a fast horse.</p> <p>Seeing the Gnome Elder disappear into the snow, Yang Ling did not hesitate. He sat cross-legged under the protection of the army and instructed a team of Horned Bee Beasts to split up and explore the entire Taildon Valley.</p> <p>After consuming a large amount of Blood Orbs concentrated from the fresh blood of the Giant Crab Spiders, he felt that the Wizard Power in his body had reached an unprecedented state. All he needed to do was recite the Wizard Mantra silently, and the raging Wizard Power would immediately circulate within his body, round after round, repeating to infinity.</p> <p>Using his power like radar, Yang Ling sent out multiple commands, instructing the Horned Bee Beasts to closely explore the immeasurable Taildon Valley and not miss any suspicious spots.</p> <p>Past the large exposed sulfur mine and the boundless belt of rocks was a piece of forest with trees dozens of meters tall. There were no Magical Beasts or monsters within the forest, but it was covered in thorny vines. An average person would not be able to set foot there.</p> <p>Past the forest seemed to be a vast plain. There were giant pillar-like objects on the plain, like giant stone plates or some weird bush. The image was faint, and Yang Ling could not see it clearly.</p> <p>Could there be a giant screen made of mental energy?</p> <p>After obtaining no results despite trying multiple times, Yang Ling shook his head in frustration. The plain was not far from where he was. If they were outside the valley, he would have been able to instruct the Horned Bee Beasts to explore the area clearly without much difficulty.</p> <p>Wizard Power determined strength, while life force determined mental energy. Perhaps the range of detection would become higher when he absorbed a large amount of life force?</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling had a thought. He immediately started to multitask without hesitation. On one hand, he instructed the Horned Bee Beasts to continue scouting the area, and on the other, he started silently reciting the Psychic Mantra.</p> <p>There were not many trees within the Taildon Valley, but there were countless tall trees of various kinds past the steep cliffs beside them, in the vast forest.</p> <p>At the start, Yang Ling could only absorb shreds of life force. But as time passed, large amounts of green life force slowly floated toward him. In just an hour’s time, Yang Ling had already been enveloped by a layer of green fog, gradually becoming thicker.</p> <p>As expected, Yang Ling felt his mental energy gradually getting stronger as he absorbed a large amount of life force. The image that the Horned Bee Beasts transmitted back to him also became clearer.</p> <p>Closer, even closer!</p> <p>In his curiosity, Yang Ling instructed the Horned Bee Beasts to inch slowly toward the giant pillar shaped items on the plain. But he could not help but feel dumbfounded when he finally saw clearly what they were!</p>",
  "Chapter 126: Strange Spell Formation": "<p>After his mental energy was strengthened, Yang Ling saw a strange image.</p> <p>A stone forest was erect on the plain, the rocks of varying shapes and sizes. Some of them looked like green pines, some like a Cloud Leopard making its way downhill, some even looked like a giant dragon baring its fangs…</p> <p>Through the nimble Horned Bee Beasts, Yang Ling could even see that intricate patterns had been carved onto the rocks. They faintly resembled tadpoles or even the mysterious symbols on the Wizard Amulets. After looking at them repeatedly, Yang Ling felt a sense of familiarity.</p> <p>Just what are these things? Stone steles, or…?</p> <p>Yang Ling was confused, unable to understand what was going on. But he could confirm that these stone steles were not a product of nature. This strange stone forest definitely hid some secrets.</p> <p>The more life force he absorbed, the greater his mental energy became, and the clearer the patterns on the stone forest got. After observing it for half a day, Yang Ling became more and more confused. The patterns on the stone forest were incredibly similar to the symbols on the Wizard Amulets, just more complicated and more massive.</p> <p>Could every stone be a giant Wizard Amulet that used stone as its carrier?</p> <p>In his confusion, Yang Ling expanded the search radius of the Horned Bee Beasts, hoping to discover any clues. Not long after, a Horned Bee Beast discovered a giant cave in the cliff on the left. It was an immensely eerie cave.</p> <p>The cave was big, and for some reason, it was releasing a Seven-colored Light. The Horned Bee Beast was unable to enter despite its best efforts, as if it had encountered a colorful layer of glass.</p> <p>Could this be a unique protective barrier?</p> <p>Yang Ling had wanted to closely research the Seven-colored Light, but just as he gathered all of the Horned Bee Beasts at the entrance of the cave, a low roar suddenly came from within the cave. Wherever the soundwave passed, a strange ripple appeared in the air. The snow instantly evaporated.</p> <p>In that instant, a dozen Horned Bee Beasts let out pathetic wails and fell onto the ground, as if hit by the impact of the soundwave. They soon lost connection with Yang Ling.</p> <p>At the same time, Yang Ling felt a rumble in his brain. He felt his head spin and an urge to retch. He could not shake the heavy feeling, almost suffocating.</p> <p>After struggling to open his eyes, Yang Ling took in a breath with much effort. Perhaps it was due to his hallucinations, but the feeling of being watched that he had sensed ever since he stepped into the valley became more obvious, as if a snake was coiled nearby, staring coldly at him.</p> <p>“Sir, are you alright!” Seeing Yang Ling suddenly turn pale, Argus hurried over in concern.</p> <p>Waving his hand, Yang Ling tried his best to adjust the energies in his body. Some time later, he took in a deep breath and said, “Argus, release my orders: no one is to leave the formation on their own. They must not go behind the rocks!”</p> <p>“Yes sir!” Seeing Yang Ling’s serious expression, Argus did not dare be careless as he turned to leave.</p> <p>Just what weird secrets did the strange stone forest have?</p> <p>Seeing Argus spreading his orders loudly not far away, Yang Ling’s expression became more and more serious. Merely the soundwave of a roar could kill a dozen Horned Bee Beasts and almost suffocate him; it was imaginable how powerful the monster within the cave was!</p> <p>Until he understood what was truly going on, the stone forest deep within the valley was a forbidden land. Yang Ling did not wish for a person to stumble into the area and invite his own doom. Even he had suffered because of his carelessness; an ordinary barbarian or elf archer would fare even worse.</p> <p>After confirming that there were no other dangers or monsters other than the one in the stone forest deep within the valley, Yang Ling once again ordered the group to set up camp in the vast area. First, it was convenient for him to scout the area around the mysterious stone forest. Second, it would also be convenient for the large scale excavation of the sulfur mine not far away.</p> <p>There was a great number of stones within the valley, but unfortunately, with the lack of suitable equipment and the heavy snow, progress was slow. They had only managed to build a stone foundation after a full day’s work. Luckily, the fox elder rushed over by the second day, not only bringing with him a large group of strong Dogmen, but also many pieces of equipment.</p> <p>Seeing the hordes of Giant Crab Spider corpses on the ground, then looking at the tarantulas who were undergoing a cocoon-like evolution, the Beastmen were immensely shocked. Even the experienced fox elder was no exception.</p> <p>Back when they had set up a team of three hundred elites to explore the area, they had also been surrounded by a group of Giant Crab Spiders. Their team had been annihilated in less than an hour. They hadn’t expected the valley to have tens of thousands of Giant Crab Spiders, nor did they expect that Yang Ling could defend himself against the strong attacks of the Giant Crab Spiders and exterminate them instead. He sure lived up to his fame as the Wissen Leader.</p> <p>Stepping on the corpses of the Giant Crab Spiders, making their way through the blood-covered snow and arriving before the giant sulfur mine, the Beastmen became dumbfounded!</p> <p>They knew that there was a giant sulfur mine within the Taildon Valley, but they could never have expected the mine to be this large. Even the speedy Dogmen might not be able to circle the mine in an hour. Even more unexpected, this was a giant exposed sulfur mine, making extraction incredibly easy.</p> <p>“Sir, we want fifty percent of whatever this mine produces. You can count on the Beastmen for everything from excavation to transporting the material!” The fox elder was incredibly excited when he saw the giant exposed sulfur mine.</p> <p>“Elder, I fought for this with my life. I can give you ten percent at the very most!” After shaking his head, Yang Ling continued, “Sulfur still has several uses other than for nurturing Black Pulp Trees. Unfortunately, the routes from Wissen Town to the other empires are long, and the cost of transport is high. I wouldn’t earn much from this. I would be making a loss if I gave you fifty percent!”</p> <p>Ten percent at most?</p> <p>Despite being prepared to haggle, the fox elder was still shocked. He had not expected Yang Ling to make such a lowball offer.</p>",
  "Chapter 127: Starlight Wizard Mantra": "<p>“Fire element, water element, earth element…” The fox elder said as he delved into the mysteries of the Seven-colored Light. He looked shocked. He had never expected that the Seven-colored Light would contain five different Magical Energies.</p> <p>On the Tailun Continent, many of the races had thought that the Beastmen were the product of Orcs and humans living together, but the Beastmen had never acknowledged that claim.</p> <p>Over the millennia, they had always insisted that the history of the Beastmen was as long as the Orc’s and the human’s, or even longer, with the proof being the records left behind through the generations. Some of the stories in the records even reached back to the era where the gods battled the demons, which was even longer than some of the records of the Orcs and humans.</p> <p>In the legends of the Beastmen, the ancient times were a wild world, and the Tailun Continent had been a dozen times bigger than it was now. Back then, they had a massive empire and expansive land, while the humans and Orcs were merely undeveloped races. But everything changed after the Great Battle of the Gods and Demons.</p> <p>The land started to split and sink, forming countless islands. Only a small fraction of the Tailun Continent’s land remained, and the Beastmen Empire had also sunk to the bottom of the sea.</p> <p>With the appearance of the Church, the humans suddenly had a few Sage level experts. They led the human army and defeated the few Beastmen elites that were lucky enough to survive. From then on, the Beastmen led vagrant lives or were forced to work as slaves.</p> <p>But despite all the blows the Beastmen had suffered, many of the tribes carried with them the historical annals and lived a hidden life within the forest. Amongst those tribes was the tribe of the fox elder.</p> <p>Despite only being at the level of a high level Great Spellcaster, the fox elder was rather familiar with various ancient spell formations because of the records in his tribe. After closely sensing the magical ripples from within the Seven-colored Light and stone steles, he was more confident of his hypothesis. These were definitely two ancient spell formations.</p> <p>“Sir, I have already sent men to contact the nearby Beastmen tribes like the Bullmen and the Medusas. Why don’t we try to find a way to dispel these two ancient spell formations after everyone is here?”</p> <p>Unable to find a way to dispel the formations, the fox elder had decided to wait a few days. Perhaps the other tribes might have better ways of breaking the formation when they arrived. Furthermore, no one knew what would happen after the spell formation was dispelled. It would be safer if they waited for the strong Bullmen and the powerful Medusas to arrive.</p> <p>“That’s fine. It will be safer with more people!”</p> <p>Dealing with the unknown monster in the cave would be easier with more manpower. Yang Ling did not mind waiting two more days. Furthermore, he was unable to understand the secrets of the stone steles and the Seven-colored Light in such a short span of time. He could do more in-depth research over these two days.</p> <p>Despite circling the stone forest a few times, he still couldn’t detect any secrets. He could not find a similar Wizard Formation on the stele in the Wizard’s Pagoda no matter how hard he tried.</p> <p>The patterns on the stone plates were complicated and mysterious. On one hand, they looked like unique Wizard Amulets, but on the other, they seemed like throbbing tadpoles. There were a total of forty-seven stone plates of varying sizes, but none of the stone plates had the same patterns.</p> <p>Could he be imagining things? Was this not a Wizard Formation, but some sort of ancient spell formation?</p> <p>A day later, Yang Ling still hadn’t found any secrets surrounding the stone plates. There were no anomalies in the cave, which made Yang Ling heave a sigh of relief, but he felt a little discouraged at the same time. After a full meal, he decided to lie down and rest on the stone plates like the rest of the Beastmen.</p> <p>As the night got darker, stars dotted the sky, their light incandescent. Looking at the blinking stars, he could not help but think about the happy times when he brought out a bamboo chair, sat on his porch, and counted stars when he was young. Unfortunately, he was unable to find the familiar Big Dipper, despite searching for a long time. At this moment, he felt deeply how foreign this world was.</p> <p>The Great Battle of the Gods and Demons, the Church, Ancient Wizards…</p> <p>Touching the pagoda-shaped mark between his brows, Yang Ling started imagining things. He had a feeling that the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda had a secret connection with the so-called Ancient Wizard of this world.</p> <p>If he could understand the secrets behind the Great Battle of the Gods and Demons and the sudden appearance of the Church a few thousand years ago, and find the reason behind the sudden disappearance of the Ancient Wizard as well as the Ancient Summoners and Tree Shepherds, he might be able to find a way back to Earth!</p> <p>Great Swordsman, Sword Saint, Sage level… What kind of level would one reach when they cultivated their abilities to Sage level?</p> <p>In this world where the strong preyed on the weak, abilities meant everything. Even a Heaven-ranked Assassin could easily kill him; Yang Ling did not dare imagine how terrifying a Sage level assassin would be. It was rumored that they were beings that could even kill level nine Magical Beasts in an instant!</p> <p>His imagination running wild, Yang Ling laid quietly on the ground. Suddenly, he noticed that the stone plate beside him was releasing a faint ray of silver light. Standing up in his curiosity, he saw that some patterns on the stone plate had turned dull, some bright, and some were even slowly moving, as if swimming tadpoles.</p> <p>Turning around, he noticed that all of the stone plates were glowing. The light was weak, almost imperceptible. The patrolling Beastmen did not notice anything strange. If not for his keen senses and greatly enhanced vision, he might not have been able to discover the phenomenon either.</p> <p>After close observation, Yang Ling noticed that the shimmering of the stone plate shared a frequency with the twinkling of the stars, as if they were absorbing the silver glow released by the stars.</p> <p>Having toiled the entire day, the Beastmen slowly fell asleep. The ground was cold and snow-covered, but they did not mind it, each slumbering deeper than the last. They lived up to their reputation as the hardy Beastmen!</p> <p>Slowly, the number of patrolling Beastmen decreased, and the time between each shift increased. No one noticed Yang Ling walking around the stone forest. No one noticed the stone plates becoming brighter, releasing streaks of silver light within the darkness.</p> <p>Flowing patterns, moving tadpoles…</p> <p>After some observation, Yang Ling had a thought. He felt that the patterns on the stone plate were slowly assembling themselves into mysterious Wizard Amulets. When they connected, they seemed to have formed a unique Wizard Mantra.</p> <p>In his curiosity, he immediately sat down cross-legged, closely observing the transformation of the patterns on the stone steles. He emulated the moving tadpoles and formed mysterious hand gestures, his movements getting faster and faster, more and more complicated. If a Beastman woke up now, he would notice that Yang Ling was radiating a faint silver glow, as if he was absorbing the vast starlight together with the stone steles.</p> <p>Feeling the boundless starlight enter his body, and the massive increase in the Wizard Power in his body, Yang Ling was elated. He had finally unintentionally discovered the secret of the stone forest. If he was right, this was a massive Wizard Formation, a complicated, mysterious, giant Spirit Gathering Spell Formation.</p> <p>Forty-nine stone steles hiding forty-nine different Wizard Mantras to form a complete Spirit Gathering Spell Formation. Four hours later, Yang Ling had finally managed to memorize all forty-nine of the complicated, mysterious Wizard Mantras.</p> <p>The mysterious Wizard Mantra had a total of nine hundred and eighty hand gestures from start to end, each hand gesture having eighty-one different transformations. If not for having cultivated his abilities to the later stages of Spirit Wizard, he might not have been able to completely memorize them all even if he had two days.</p> <p>Absorbing the energy of the sky full of stars, endless… In the future, Yang Ling was going to call the Wizard Mantra he learned from the stone plates the Starlight Wizard Mantra!</p> <p>Yang Ling gave a satisfied nod after absorbing a massive amount of energy from the starlight. He could feel his Wizard Power pulsing. At this moment, he finally confirmed that there had been a group of powerful Wizards who had lived on this foreign continent in ancient times. As long as he could discover their secrets, he could perhaps understand the reason that he had arrived in this strange world and find a way back to Earth.</p> <p>The Magical Beast Essence Crystals also released a Seven-colored Light when he had set up a formation in Wissen Castle. Could there be several Essence Crystals of high level Magical Beasts buried near the cave that formed another Spirit Gathering Spell Formation when the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation at the stone forest was activated, thereby creating the persistent Seven-colored Light?</p> <p>He got a shock when he saw it!</p> <p>When Yang Ling explored the Seven-colored Light at the cave’s entrance by projecting his mental energy outward, Yang Ling did not find any Magical Beast Essence Crystals. Instead, he found countless crystals under the ground. There were red Dark Fire Crystals, white Chilly Ice Crystals, blue Agates… The various crystals were all piled tightly together, an innumerable amount!</p> <p>Could there be a massive natural Seven-colored Mine under the ground?</p> <p>After his shock, Yang Ling became incredibly excited. There was a great deal of information surrounding every aspect of cultivating Wizard Techniques on the stele, and quite a few of them were explanations of various crystal mines and crystals.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, a natural vein of crystal could not possess crystals of opposing elements at the same time. For example, if there was a vein of Dark Fire Crystals, it was impossible for there to be Chilly Ice Crystals of a counteracting element. But the Seven-colored Mine was an exception. It had a naturally occurring chaotic energy and could nurture crystals of conflicting elements.</p> <p>If he had a large number of crystals, he could not only accelerate the speed of his cultivation, he could also set up Wizard Formations such as the Spirit Gathering Spell Formation or Maze Formation and strengthen the defenses of Wissen Town. After taking a few deep breaths, Yang Ling started deliberating his future plans.</p> <p>There were many races of Beastmen, from Foxmen who produced many Spellcasters, Bullmen who were hailed as the most powerful infantry units in the continent, and even the “Rulers of Blades,” the Medusas. Under the combined blows of the humans and Orcs, the Beastmen scattered like the sand, unable to unite to form a massive force.</p> <p>After receiving a large amount of sulfur to nurture their powerful Black Pulp Melons, it might be possible for the Beastmen to set up a giant Beastmen Empire. If they obtained a large amount of premium crystals on top of that, they would receive an even greater boost of power, which was not a good thing for Wissen Town. No matter what, Yang Ling did not wish for an uncontrollable force to appear near his territory.</p> <p>According to what the fox elder had said, there would be a large number of Beastmen warriors and Spellcasters who would arrive tomorrow. The best way to cover up the Seven-colored Mine was to divert their attention. He was going to dispel the Seven-colored Light at the entrance and get them to deal with the monster within the cave.</p> <p>The monster within the cave was no laughing matter. Even with they were to obtain victory, the Beastmen might have to pay a painful price. It would be even better if he could establish a firm control over the Beastmen in the Ladak Mountain Range by absorbing them into his camp after they suffered heavy casualties!</p> <p>Looking at the sky, Yang Ling knew that he only had a few hours left until daybreak. Without wasting time, he made his decision, then immediately woke up the Twin-headed Ogre Braska and his men. He summoned the Withered Tree Warriors and the Unicorn, then sat cross-legged under their protection.</p> <p>Without a large amount of Wizard Power as an activation, the mine under the ground would be unable to release visible Seven-colored Light when obstructed by a thick layer of soil, no matter how large the mine was. If he absorbed the Wizard Power released by the Wizard Formation in the stone forest and severed the energy being transferred into the underground mine, he might be able to indirectly block the Seven-colored Light at the entrance of the cave.</p>",
  "Chapter 128: Wizard Core": "<p>Sitting cross-legged, after silently reciting the Wizard Mantra, Yang Ling felt the energy released by the Wizard Formation in the stone forest enter his body. The energy circulated around his body on a mysterious track, brought along by the Wizard Power. Round after round, the energy became converted into pure, blood red Wizard Power.</p> <p>Concentrate, concentrate it even more!</p> <p>After absorbing a massive amount of energy, he tried his best to concentrate the Wizard Power in his body, Slowly, the blood red Wizard Power in his body became more and more pure, seeping into every muscle and every inch of bone.</p> <p>As he forced the concentration, he felt as though his body was a sponge, manically absorbing the energy gathered by the Wizard Formation in the stone forest. Soon, the energy that had been accumulated for eons in the ground and stone plates was released, forming a white fog around Yang Ling, getting thicker and thicker.</p> <p>He might as well go all out now. Clenching his teeth, Yang Ling started to multitask, reciting the Psychic Mantra along with the Wizard Mantra. Soon, the trees around him swayed without wind, releasing streaks of green life force. Slowly, the life force got entangled with the energy gathered by the Wizard Formation in the stone forest, forming a fog that was intertwined with white and green.</p> <p>The energy gathered by the Wizard Formation in the stone forest was too massive. After absorbing it for an hour, Yang Ling felt as though his body was going to explode from the pulsing Wizard Power, but the colorful light at the door remained unmoved, not changing at all.</p> <p>Is it a problem with the method, or am I absorbing too little of the energy? Or could it be that the Wizard Formation in the stone forest is rapidly restoring the energy after absorbing the starlight?</p> <p>Seeing that there was no change in the colorful light at the entrance of the cave, Yang Ling was confused. He decided to add another level to his plan after a moment’s deliberation, his hands rapidly forming the gestures for the Starlight Wizard Mantra. He hoped that he could steal some of the energy from the Wizard Formation in the stone forest and weaken, or perhaps, break the supply of energy to the colorful light.</p> <p>As his hand gestures got faster and more complicated, he felt a rich, massive energy enter his body. The pagoda-shaped mark between his brows started quickly rising in temperature as it throbbed excitedly. It absorbed the massive energy like a whale swallowing seawater.</p> <p>Yang Ling felt that the rate at which he was absorbing energy was already ridiculous enough, but it was incomparable to the Wizard’s Pagoda. The mark was absorbing energy like a bottomless pit! If his body was a pond, then the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda would be the Dongting Lake, manically absorbing the energy in the surroundings.</p> <p>You’re reading on B o x n o v e l. com Thanks!</p> <p>After absorbing a massive amount of energy, the Wizard’s Pagoda released a refreshing energy, which quickly circulated within his body. Slowly, Yang Ling felt his mental energy increase. He could clearly sense every action around him, even with his eyes closed. One mile, two miles… He saw the Beastmen patrolling before the sulfur mine. He saw the spider army that had turned into cocoons. The radius in which he could sense things had increased.</p> <p>With the Wizard’s Pagoda’s manic absorption of energy, the colorful light at the entrance of the cave finally began to change. After a creak, its color became duller, no longer releasing a blinding light. Yang Ling finally saw some hope.</p> <p>Ever since the trees around them had moved without the wind and let out rustling sounds, the Beastmen had all woken up from their slumber. Even the fox elder who had been sleeping in the tent was no exception.</p> <p>Could it be that other than being a Summoner, Yang Ling was also a Great Spellcaster, or even a rarely seen Magical Tutor?</p> <p>Seeing the strange, thick fog around Yang Ling and feeling his massive pulsing Magical Energy, the fox elder lost his color in shock, feeling lucky that he had not engaged in conflict with Yang Ling when they first met. Fierce soldiers, a terrifying Magical Beast army, and powerful magic… Who in a thousand mile radius around Wissen Town was a match for Yang Ling?</p> <p>After quickly sending his people out of the strange stone forest, the fox elder was overcome with worry, seeing Yang Ling display his abilities. Without a doubt, a powerful leader had been born in Wissen Town. Where would his clansmen who had proliferated in the Ladak Mountain Range for centuries go now?</p> <p>Even though Yang Ling had once promised that the Beastmen would be able to act as they pleased in Wissen Town and guaranteed that his clansmen would have the same privileges as the humans, who could guarantee that those words were not empty talk?</p> <p>If they did not enter Yang Ling’s camp, how would his clansmen survive in the Ladak Mountain Range? The fox elder had a serious look on his face. Even he would not allow an uncontrollable faction to exist near his tribe, much less a human leader who was usually said to be greedy and crafty!</p> <p>Abilities, everything depended on one’s abilities!</p> <p>If the Beastmen had a Sage level powerhouse, his clansmen would not have landed in such a sorry state today. After a moment’s deliberation, the fox elder chose to go with the flow. If Yang Ling one day fulfilled his promise and had enough abilities to protect the factions that followed him, then it would not be too late to enter his camp. Of course, until the situation was that rosy, he still needed to be on good terms with Yang Ling.</p> <p>The fox elder felt more at ease after coming to a decision, but Yang Ling’s situation was getting more and more dire!</p> <p>Even though the Wizard’s Pagoda had absorbed a large amount of the energy from the stars, the life force, and the energy accumulated by the stone forest over the millennia, Yang Ling himself had also absorbed much of this energy. The massive amount of energy had far exceeded his imagination!</p> <p>Even though he had made the swift decision to immediately stop casting the Psychic Spell and Starlight Wizard Mantra, the situation was already out of his control! Under the effects of the Wizard’s Pagoda, the massive energy swirled toward him, entering his body through every single one of his pores.</p> <p>Slowly, he realized that due to his extreme concentration, the Wizard Power and life force in his body were being forcefully fused together. It turned from a gaseous state to a liquid state, then from a liquid to a solid, accumulating a massive energy. Slowly, as the energy far exceeded what he could bear, he started bleeding from all of his pores.</p> <p>Soon, looking from outside through the thick fog, one could see that Yang Ling had become fully covered in blood. Luckily, the refreshing feeling released by the Wizard’s Pagoda guided the massive energy in his body, slowly moving it and gathering it near his dantian, concentrating the energy once again. Otherwise, the massive amounts of energy would have long since caused his body to explode.</p> <p>Seeing streaks of blood oozing out of Yang Ling’s body, even the far away Beastmen felt that something was off, much less the Ogres who had been standing by his side to protect him. But in such a short span of time, no one, be it the Twin-headed Ogre Braska or the fox elder, had any ideas and did not dare act recklessly.</p> <p>Once the energy transferred to it by the stone forest was forcefully interrupted, the colorful light at the entrance of the cave became duller. Slowly, it revealed the faint outlines of a cave. From far away, the area within the cave was pitch black. No one knew how deep that strange cave went.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, so cold!”</p> <p>Seeing the colorful light getting duller, the group felt gusts of cold wind blowing out of the cave, the cold piercing their bones. It was even colder than the cold wind carrying snow on the outside. No one knew what was going on. Perhaps it was only his imagination, but the fox elder felt that the cold wind brought with it shreds of sinister Magical Energy, incredibly eerie!</p> <p>“Without my orders, no one is to act recklessly!”</p> <p>The expression of the fox elder became more and more serious. For some reason, the cave behind the colorful light gave him an unprecedented sense of danger. As a precaution, he restrained the clansmen who were ready to charge out and investigate the matter, then sent out a few agile scouts to obtain the location of the reinforcements who were estimated to arrive at daybreak.</p> <p>Clenching his teeth, Yang Ling felt as though his body was being sliced by knives, his consciousness getting hazy. Some time later, the raging energy in his dantian rapidly expanded, then quickly contracted, shrinking to an orb the size of a pinhead, manically absorbing the energy in his body.</p> <p>At the same time, the dull Seven-colored Light finally scattered, revealing a pitch black cave.</p> <p>A Wizard Core? Did he unintentionally break through to the level of Earth Wizard and create a Wizard Core?</p> <p>Feeling the changes in his body, Yang Ling trembled. He was elated when he remembered the explanation on the square stele. Originally, his only intention was to dispel the Seven-colored Light at the entrance of the cave. He had not expected to break through the bottleneck after absorbing the massive amounts of energy!</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>Before he had time to closely observe the transformations in his body, a powerful, low roar suddenly came from within the cave. In that moment, just like the impact he suffered previously, his body was sent flying from the formless wave of air. He spat out a large mouthful of blood. The grain-sized, newly-formed Wizard Core nearly shattered.</p> <p>Caught off guard, even the Ogres and few Beastmen who were nearby were sent flying, much less Yang Ling who was at the very front. Only the Unicorn, a level eight Magical Beast, stopped the violent wave of air after taking a few steps back.</p> <p>“Not good! Move forward quick!”</p> <p>Originally, seeing Yang Ling spit out a mouthful of blood, the fox elder had wanted to go forward personally to investigate. But after the roar, massive Giant Crab Spiders started crawling out of the cave in hordes, with no end in sight. In his shock, he quickly got his clansmen to charge forward and block the cave.</p> <p>The fox elder knew more than anyone how terrifying the Giant Crab Spiders were. He had been there when three hundred elites of his clan had lost their lives after being surrounded by the creatures. If they became heavily surrounded by this large group of speedy Giant Crab Spiders, none of them might be able to escape the Taildon Valley!</p> <p>The weapons of the Dogmen were strange. They were a sharp wooden spike that resembled a harpoon. When a Dogman threw one out with full strength, the weapon pinned a Giant Crab Spider to the ground in the blink of an eye. They were superior to the elf archers both in range and power. But caught off guard, faced with the tidal assault of the Giant Crab Spiders, even they could not do much.</p> <p>Gripping his staff and muttering an incantation, the fox elder led a few of his clansmen to release walls of fire, hoping to seal the Giant Crab Spiders into the cave. Unexpectedly, the horde of Giant Crab Spiders were unafraid of death, and they manically charged into the flames. Some spat out acidic poison, and some dived into the ground and unleashed waves of Earth Spikes, killing dozens of Dogmen in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>Seeing more and more Giant Crab Spiders swarm out of the cave while they were suffering more and more casualties, a Dogmen said in fear, “Elder, retreat! It will be too late if we do not leave now!”</p> <p>Retreat?</p> <p>Seeing his fearful clansmen and the Giant Crab Spiders advancing toward them, the fox elder swallowed with difficulty. This was the deepest region of the Taildon Valley, with all three sides being steep cliffs. There was no other way back other than the way they had gotten here.</p> <p>But the path back was a winding area of strange stones. They would not be able to move quickly, and they would definitely not outrun the speedy Giant Crab Spiders. Going the original way back was definitely inviting their own deaths. There might still be hope if they could seal the Giant Crab Spiders within the cave!</p> <p>Knowing that there was no way out, the fox elder launched walls of flame, the fire rising to the air. He instructed the group to fight back with all their strength, hoping that they could seal the Giant Crab Spiders within the cave. But with more and more Giant Crab Spiders swarming out of the cave, the situation was becoming more dire.</p>",
  "Chapter 129: Spider Hive": "<p>Just as the fox elder felt his scalp turning numb and realized that there was no escaping this crisis, a concentrated rain of light suddenly fell near the entrance of the cave, reducing the horde of Giant Crab Spiders to a paste!</p> <p>At the critical moment, Yang Ling had stood up with much effort and summoned the Evil Eye army and their powerful attacks!</p> <p>After receiving backup from the Evil Eye army, the fearful Dogmen felt a boost in morale. They threw their harpoons out fiercely, sealing the Giant Crab Spiders within the cave together with the Evil Eye army.</p> <p>The Giant Crab Spiders had powerful attacks, but they lacked sufficient range, and so they were fully suppressed by the Evil Eyes and Dogmen. They were not able to force their way out despite their heavy casualties!</p> <p>Roar!</p> <p>Seeing the consistently failing attacks, another low, powerful roar came from within the cave. This time, Yang Ling reacted quickly, using Earth Evasion and phasing ten steps away, narrowly avoiding the terrifying air wave.</p> <p>Having successfully advanced to the level of Earth Wizard and formed the Wizard Core, he had rapidly mastered the beginner Wizard Technique “Earth Evasion.” According to the explanation on the stele, reaching the level of Earth Wizard would not only allow him to gain further control over the souls of the Magical Beasts he tamed, he could also gradually master various evasion techniques and cultivate more mysterious Wizard Techniques. At the very least, he had another ability to save his life, and he could avoid sudden attacks by his enemies.</p> <p>Yang Ling managed to avoid the attack in time, but the slow-moving Evil Eye army in front of him could not dodge. The terrifying wave of air blasted over a large portion of them, killing a few dozen on the spot and heavily injuring the rest. Even the powerful Evil Eye Tyrant bled from the mouth, suffering from heavy internal injuries.</p> <p>The Evil Eye army suffered heavy casualties, but the Beastmen who were nearby were not affected, as they had merely taken a few steps back. After the Evil Eye army was hit, the pressure landed on the Beastmen, and the situation took a turn once again!</p> <p>Could the terrifying roar be an attack on the soul, one that was only effective on him and the Magical Beasts he had tamed?</p> <p>After a moment’s surprise, Yang Ling quickly recalled the Evil Eye army to prevent any greater losses. He grabbed a bunch of Wizard Amulets and charged forward. Behind him, the Unicorn followed him closely and shot out thick bolts of lightning.</p> <p>Receiving assistance from Yang Ling and the Unicorn, the pressure on the Dogmen was alleviated a little. But with the Giant Crab Spiders who were unafraid of death swarming out, and people frequently falling after being hit by the fatal poison, the situation was still rather bad for them!</p> <p>“Braska, notify the elf archers to come here, quick!”</p> <p>Yang Ling gave a loud order after throwing out a Wizard Amulet and blasting away a Giant Crab Spider. Like the barbarians, the Twin-headed Ogre Braska was formidable at close combat, but he had little to no abilities when it came to ranged battles. The Evil Eyes and Horned Bee Beasts couldn’t resist the terrifying soundwave, while the spider army hadn’t finished their evolution. At this point in time, only the elf archers could be effective.</p> <p>“Yes, master!”</p> <p>Seeing that he could not help even if he stayed, Braska bowed after receiving the order and left quickly with a few of his clansmen. But he let out a cry after turning around. Yang Ling turned back to see a large group of people coming out of the forest, charging toward them at high speed!</p> <p>“Elder, it’s the Bullmen and Medusas! Our reinforcements have arrived!” Looking closely, a Foxman Spellcaster cheered loudly, clenching his teeth and expending the last of his Magical Energy to cast a rising wall of fire.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, defend on! We’ll burn their nest with flames later!”</p> <p>“Die, d*mn it!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Knowing that their reinforcements had arrived, the Beastmen had a boost in morale, clenching their teeth as they attacked the horde of Giant Crab Spiders.</p> <p>The Beastmen reinforcements were extremely fast, charging in front of the group in the blink of an eye. There were three-meter-tall Bullmen who were carrying giant totem poles on their backs and wielding battle halberds, and there were also Medusas with the lower bodies of snakes who wielded two blades.</p> <p>The Bullmen’s attacks were simple but effective. They roared as they flailed the giant battle halberds to release a shockwave. The shockwave was like a sharp blade, mercilessly slicing all of the Giant Crab Spiders in a ten step radius in two.</p> <p>Compared to the Bullmen, the Medusas were more adept at close combat and were mainly responsible for the stragglers who were charging out of the cave. They charged forward with a flail of their long snake tails, slicing Giant Crab Spiders in two before rapidly retreating. They were so fast that they left afterimages, truly living up to their reputation as the “Rulers of Blades.”</p> <p>With the entry of over three hundred Bullmen and two hundred Medusas, the pressure on Yang Ling and the Dogmen eased. They quickly gained the upper hand after Argus led the elf archers over.</p> <p>Despite the heavy casualties, the hordes of Giant Crab Spiders still charged forward, unafraid of death. Their numbers were unbelievable. It was obvious that there was a spider hive within the cave, an unprecedentedly large spider hive!</p> <p>The spiders had powerful attacks and massive numbers, but unfortunately, they were unable to charge out of the cave under the combined attacks of the group. In just an hour, blood covered the area, and the entrance of the cave was piled high with the corpses of Giant Crab Spiders. Over that period of time, several angry roars came from within the cave, but they did not alleviate the situation!</p> <p>Against low level Magical Beasts like the Horned Bee Beasts and Evil Eyes, the terrifying soundwave had immense power, but to the Beastmen who had thick hides and muscles, it could not cause much harm. At the very most, it caused them to take a few steps back.</p> <p>After many repetitions, Yang Ling could confirm that the roars that came from within the cave were a unique way to attack the soul, and they would only cause great harm to himself and the Magical Beasts he had tamed.</p> <p>According to the explanation on the stele, the reason a Wizard could tame Magical Beasts was precisely because he could control their souls, and thus they were more susceptible to attacks on the soul. That was also the reason why high level Wizards would primarily cultivate their ability to control souls. After they were successful, they could not only attack the souls of their opponents, they could also strengthen a soul’s resistance to attacks.</p> <p>Seeing the endless stream of Giant Crab Spiders unafraid of death, the fox elder, ox chief, and Medusa leader decided to take turns entering the fray in an attempt to exhaust the spiders using a long drawn out battle. Yang Ling also split the elf archers into two groups and instructed them to attack in waves. He got onto his Unicorn and moved to the back of the army, closely observing the changes in his body.</p> <p>The grain-sized Wizard Core was pulsing in his dantian, causing the Wizard Power in his body to circulate. Despite being only the size of a grain, Yang Ling could feel that it harbored a massive Wizard Power, much more than before.</p> <p>Furthermore, his mental energy was also visibly enhanced, allowing him to sense movement in his surroundings more clearly. In fact, he could even sharpy detect every action of the Tarantula King that had turned into a cocoon a few miles away. Through its memories, Yang Ling knew that the spider army was in the final stage of its evolution, and the spiders would emerge from their cocoons in a few hours.</p> <p>He had managed to break through to the level of Earth Wizard after absorbing a portion of the energy. How much would the Wizard’s Pagoda have changed after absorbing tens of times, even hundreds of times more energy than he had?</p> <p>Recalling the mysterious Wizard’s Pagoda, Yang Ling had a thought and injected his consciousness into the area.</p> <p>In one night, the space around the Wizard’s Pagoda had increased tenfold. A pond with azure waters had appeared in the middle of the vast field. The little Unicorn stood guard beside the pond, only allowing the Horned Bee Beasts and injured Evil Eyes to take a small sip each. Those who took a larger sip would be immediately pushed back by a small bolt of lightning. It had become the owner of the water.</p> <p>“Hehe, you sure are a miser!”</p> <p>Stroking the head of the little Unicorn, Yang Ling curiously took a sip of the azure pond water. He had just drunk the water when he felt a cold current circulating in his body, slowly seeping into every part of his body. He felt a jolt of energy, as if he had taken a sip of the rare Water from the Spring of Life!</p> <p>Could this be spring water formed by the green life force?</p> <p>Taking a look at the azure water, seeing the Evil Eyes recover after taking a sip, Yang Ling had a thought. The Wizard Pagoda had not only absorbed a large amount of energy from the stars and the energy accumulated by the Wizard Formation in the stone forest, it had also absorbed a massive quantity of green life force. It was possible that the massive quantity had invoked a change in quality, causing it to form a pond in the space holding the Wizard’s Pagoda.</p> <p>Perhaps taming the sapling of the Tree of Life and moving it to the space containing the Wizard’s Pagoda would cause it to grow faster!</p> <p>Seeing the Withered Tree Warriors in front of the Wizard’s Pagoda turn into tall trees, seeing their lush leaves, seeing their bark getting thicker under the nourishment of the white fog, he quickly came up with an idea.</p> <p>With his Wizard Power getting stronger, the white fog released from within the Wizard’s Pagoda became thicker. It could not only greatly boost the evolution of the Magical Beasts such as the Horned Bee Beasts, Evil Eyes, and spiders, it could also hasten the growth of trees. If he transplanted the sapling of the Tree of Life here, he might be able to obtain a large amount of Water from the Spring of Life in a few short years, many times faster than its normal rate of growth!</p> <p>According to the explanation on the stele, Wizard Techniques were harder to cultivate the higher level one was. Without any miraculous elixirs, one would need more than a hundred years to advance from the level of Spirit Wizard to Earth Wizard, and a millennium or longer to advance from the level of Earth Wizard to Heaven Wizard, so on and so forth!</p> <p>Yang Ling didn’t know how many miraculous elixirs there were in this foreign world, but he was sure that the Water from the Spring of Life was a treasure he desperately needed. If he had a large amount of Water from the Spring of Life, he would be able to stabilize his level of Earth Wizard. In fact, he might be able to break through to the level of Heaven Wizard within a short span of time.</p> <p>Chitter…</p> <p>Just as he was about to further investigate the transformations in the space containing the Wizard’s Pagoda, a familiar ripple suddenly appeared in his brain. He instinctively formed a hand gesture after some deliberation. In that instant, the spider army led by the Tarantula King appeared in his eyes.</p> <p>After consuming a large amount of Giant Crab Spider Essence Crystals, the normal spiders had all evolved to the fourth level. The range of their poison had doubled to become much further than that of the Giant Crab Spiders. Furthermore, they had all gained the ability of Earth Spike and could dig underground to release waves of Earth Spikes to attack the targets above ground, just like the Giant Crab Spiders.</p> <p>The Tarantula King had evolved to the fifth level, formally entering the ranks of a mid level Magical Beast. Other than obtaining the ability of Earth Spike, it also grew two lumps of flesh on both sides of its body, near its ribs. According to its memories, the lumps of meat would turn into wings during its next evolution, transforming it into a fearsome Flying Spider, its offensive capabilities much higher than Magical Beasts of the same level.</p> <p>It needs to evolve one more time?</p> <p>Yang Ling shook his head bitterly after understanding what was going on. The Tarantula King had only managed to evolve from level four to level five after killing the swarm of Giant Crab Spiders and consuming thousands of Giant Crab Spider Essence Crystals. How hard would it be to evolve it to level six?</p> <p>In principle, every Magical Beast could evolve continuously, but it was near impossible practically speaking. It was harder to evolve a Magical Beast of a higher level. For example, the tarantulas could evolve from level one to level four in a short amount of time, but if a level eight Magical Beast like the Unicorn consumed the same amount of energy, it would not have any visible transformation, much less evolve.</p> <p>After understanding the difficulty when it came to the evolution of Magical Beasts, Yang Ling did not harbor hopes that the Horned Bee Beasts, Evil Eyes, and spiders would evolve to become high level Magical Beasts. All he wanted was for there to be a high level champion responsible for commanding the army.</p> <p>The battle ability of an army was not completely dependent on the number of brilliant soldiers, but also the cooperative abilities between the warriors. The Magical Beast army was no exception. Yang Ling believed that as long as he commanded them properly, and if there was a degree of collaboration, an army of mid to low level Magical Beasts would still stand a chance when they encountered a team of high level Magical Beasts.</p>",
  "Chapter 130: Twin-headed Horse Spider": "<p>After an hour of continuous attacks, there were no more Giant Crab Spiders emerging from the cave, as if they had already been exterminated. That was when Goode and a group of warriors hurried over, amongst them a few Spellcasters. Now, the abilities of the group became even stronger.</p> <p>“Sir, this cave is incredibly weird. We will not be able to conduct a large scale excavation at the sulfur mine unless we properly scout this cave!” After confirming that there were no more Giant Crab Spiders in the cave, the fox elder deliberated for a moment before saying, “Our abilities are strong now. Rather than waiting here and doing nothing, why don’t we enter the cave and investigate it!”</p> <p>“Yes, we have to understand whatever is happening in the cave as soon as possible!” Raising his sharp halberd, the ox chief loudly agreed with the fox elder’s suggestion.</p> <p>The ox chief was muscular, his height roughly equal to the Twin-headed Ogre Braska. He was covered in developed muscles, clearly coming from a race adept at close combat. In addition to the giant war halberd, he was carrying two totem poles about half the height of an average person on his back. Despite the falling snow, he was dressed in thin clothing, revealing his bulging muscles. He looked exceptionally violent, barbaric!</p> <p>Seeing the group shift their gazes toward her, the Medusa leader only nodded slightly, indicating that she agreed with the fox elder’s suggestion. Unlike the ox chief, she was wearing thick leather armor and had a total of four hands on both sides of her body, each wielding a curved scimitar that radiated a cold gleam. After seeing her blinding speed and precise blade techniques, Yang Ling did not doubt her battle power.</p> <p>“Time waits for no man. Let’s go investigate what’s going on within the cave!”</p> <p>Seeing Argus hurry over with a large group of barbarians, then looking at Goode and the rest arriving from far away, Yang Ling immediately agreed with the fox elder’s suggestion. For the large exposed sulfur mine, for the massive veins of crystals underground, he would have had no choice but to enter and scout the area even if there were no Beastmen around, much less now that there were so many powerful Bullmen and Medusas.</p> <p>After completing the preparations, the group cautiously walked into the cave, careful with every step they took.</p> <p>The powerful Bullmen took the front, responsible for opening a path. The Dogmen followed behind them, their task to provide the Bullmen with long-range firepower; Yang Ling, Goode, and the fox elder, as well as the rest of their men, were gathered in the middle so that they could adapt to any changes. The inner circle was comprised of elf archers responsible for long-range attacks, while the outer circle was occupied by the Medusas and Ogres who were adept in both defense and offense. Finally, the powerful barbarians were responsible for covering their backs.</p> <p>Before they moved into the cave, Yang Ling had left Argus with three hundred Ogres, fifty elf archers, and twenty barbarians, tasked to stay outside and deal with anything that came their way. Coupled with the more than two hundred warriors Goode had brought with him, they formed a large team of six hundred people, more than enough to deal with any unforeseen circumstances and help the group defend their path of retreat.</p> <p>The cave of the spiders was large, the ground even. The group was mighty, moving forward unobstructed. Other than a few small spiders, they did not encounter any monsters. But for some reason, Yang Ling had a feeling of unease, and the feeling became more obvious as they delved deeper into the cave.</p> <p>At the start, the walls on both sides were not unique, save for the spider webs of varying sizes. But as they ventured deeper into the cave, wall carvings of various kinds started appearing on both sides of the walls. There were drawings of winding mountain ranges, a boundless sea, even the vast galaxy, dotted with stars of varying sizes.</p> <p>Taking another corner, the group stepped onto a giant pathway paved with granite. At regular intervals, they would come across a glowing crystal adorning the ground. In the dim light, they could see visible transformations in the cave drawings on both sides of the walls. They were now carved with various images, from ferocious two-legged flying dragons to ancient divine temples. There were even priests earnestly grovelling on the ground…</p> <p>What the hell is this?</p> <p>Yang Ling felt more and more confused the deeper he went. With the technology and civilization in this world, it was impossible that they would understand the shapes of planets, nor could they draw a galaxy in such intricate detail. Without enough power, they would also be unable to excavate such a massive cave from the body of a mountain!</p> <p>Yang Ling was full of doubt, and the fox elder was no exception. His expression became more serious the deeper into the cave he went. Many of the wall drawings felt familiar, but there was always a faint sense that something was off, but he could not place what it was.</p> <p>After walking for an hour, the group arrived at a strange crossroad. The walls of the path on the left had carvings of high level Magical Beasts like flying dragons and Chimeras, the path in the middle was carved with earnest priests and ancient divine temples, while the tunnel on the right had walls carved with rising flames and demons holding scythes.</p> <p>Flying dragons, divine temples, demons…</p> <p>Looking a the sinister crossroad, looking at the lifelike flying dragons and demons, even the powerful Bullmen felt an unprecedented sense of danger, much less the elf archers. Originally, the group had thought that the cave was only a hive for the spiders, but after walking for half a day, they now realized that the situation far exceeded their imaginations!</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Just as the group was unsure which direction to take, a low, powerful rumble came suddenly from deep within the cave. It was as if a strong gust was assaulting them, their clothes flapping in the air.</p> <p>The instant before the terrifying soundwave hit him, Yang Ling felt the Wizard Core in his body spin faster, driving the protective Wizard Power to quickly circulate in his body. His body released a thin, faint layer of red light, forcefully intercepting the sieging soundwave. Despite that, he still felt his body tremble, and he could not help letting out a grunt.</p> <p>“Sir, be careful!”</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s body shake, the sensitive Goode lifted his hand and created a small barrier for Yang Ling. As a Great Spellcaster, he could sense that the soundwave harbored a powerful mental attack, and its effect on Yang Ling seemed exceptionally prominent.</p> <p>“Sir, are you alright?”</p> <p>After his shock, the fox elder looked nervously at Yang Ling, his expression turning more serious. In terms of individual ability, Yang Ling who was a Summoner might not stand out from within this group of people. But in terms of true ability, he might be stronger than the sum of everyone here.</p> <p>The fox elder believed that if Yang Ling summoned the Magical Beast army and got them into formation, even the powerful ox chief might not be able to survive long enough to reach Yang Ling. He basically had no chance of winning.</p> <p>“It’s alright, I am fine!” Taking a deep breath, Yang Ling felt that he had not suffered any physical harm. His resistance for Soul Attacks was much greater now that he had formed the Wizard Core. If this had happened two days ago, he might have spat out blood after suffering the impact of one soundwave.</p> <p>According to the explanation on the stele, people with stronger souls were more susceptible to the Soul Attacks. Because of that, in front of the same soundwave, the Bullmen, barbarians, and Ogres who fought their battles using their tough muscles were the safest. Spellcasters such as Goode and the fox elder were second, while Yang Ling was the most susceptible.</p> <p>A Wizard was extremely susceptible to Soul Attacks, and would be easily injured if their abilities were not strong enough. But their resistance toward Soul Attacks would increase dramatically when they reached a certain stage in their training, becoming far superior to the Ogres and barbarians who had weak souls. That was the reason why Yang Ling did not suffer from any physical damage. If he had not reached the level of Earth Wizard, he might have retreated long ago.</p> <p>Seeing the three sinister paths, the group hesitated for a long while, unsure of where to go. But no one dared suggest splitting up. Splitting up in this sinister cave was the most foolish course of action, and they would only be picked off individually by the monsters hiding in the dark.</p> <p>It was unfortunate that the Horned Bee Beasts couldn’t defend themselves against the terrifying soundwave!</p> <p>Thinking about the Soul Attack imbued within the soundwave, Yang Ling shook his head in frustration. If it wasn’t for that terrifying soundwave, sending out the Horned Bee Beasts to scout the way would be the optimal choice. But being so close to the home of that monster, sending them to scout a path was definitely sending them to their doom.</p> <p>“Sir, you can decide which path we take. We will listen to your orders!” After a moment’s discussion, the fox elder represented the Beastmen and elected Yang Ling as the leader, fully willing to listen to his instructions and plans.</p> <p>Both in constitution and strength, humans were naturally incomparable to the powerful Beastmen and Orcs, but they were exceptional when it came to leadership abilities and adaptability on the battlefield. Many of the intelligent races had to admit this even though they did not like humans, and the Beastmen were no exception.</p> <p>In the heart of the fox elder, Yang Ling being able to fight back ten thousand of the Banto Empire’s Black Armor Guards and seize firm control over Wissen Town naturally meant that he had exceptional abilities. Furthermore, his faction was the strongest within their group. Other than being able to summon a Magical Beast army at any time, merely having a few hundred elf archers, barbarians, and Ogres was already about half the total abilities of the group.</p> <p>They will listen to my orders?</p> <p>Seeing the fox elder toss the ball into his court, Yang Ling shook his head and let out a mirthless smile, but he did not reject the offer. As long as he planned it well, he could not only securely control the situation in the Taildon Valley after killing the monster in the cave, he could also set the foundation for subsuming the Beastmen in the Ladak Mountain Range. It was two birds with one stone!</p> <p>Nothing ventured, nothing gained!</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, seeing the three sinister crossroads before him, Yang Ling decided to take a gamble. He was prepared to find a way as soon as possible even if it meant sacrificing a few Horned Bee Beasts.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, just as he was about to sit down cross-legged, the pagoda-shaped mark between his brows started pulsing in agitation. Following which, the Unicorn that was staying guard by his side also neighed. Soon, a chilling skittering sound came from all around them.</p> <p>“Quick, get into formation!” In his shock, Yang Ling issued an order loudly, not daring to wait around. Having been through many life threatening battles, he instinctively could sense an impending, unprecedented danger.</p> <p>With the help of the fox elder, the group soon formed a tight formation in the wide tunnel. The fierce Bullmen and Ogres took the front, responsible for any close combat. The barbarians and Medusas stayed behind, preventing the enemy from suddenly emerging at their backs and attacking them. The rest of the people stayed in the middle so that they could adapt to any changes.</p> <p>Chitter…</p> <p>With strange piercing cries, a large group of calf-sized monsters swarmed out from all three paths. They had two watermelon-sized heads growing from their necks, and their calf-sized bodies were covered in spines like a porcupine. They had four horse-like hoofs growing from each side of their bodies. Their sharp fangs had a cold gleam, and they had a stub for a tail. They looked incredibly eerie!</p> <p>“Twin-headed Horse Spiders. My god, they are Twin-headed Horse Spiders!” the fox elder shouted in shock.</p> <p>Seeing the sudden appearance of the fierce monsters, he swallowed with difficulty and gripped his staff tightly in his hand.</p>",
  "Chapter 131: Nine-tailed Fox": "<p>Twin-headed Horse Spiders?</p> <p>Yang Ling could not find any memories associated with the Twin-headed Horse Spiders even after he sifted through the memories of the Unicorn and Tarantula King. He could not understand how terrifying these creatures much have been to make the fox elder so fearful!</p> <p>Soon, the fierce Twin-headed Horse Spiders showed him why the elder was so terrified!</p> <p>After letting out a collective roar, the speedy Twin-headed Horse Spiders accelerated once again, charging toward the group as fast as a rocket. A dark red light appeared around their bodies, and even the harpoons of the Dogmen bounced off as if they had hit a thick layer of steel. The arrows of the elf archers didn’t stand a chance.</p> <p>“Use the Demon Dispelling Technique to remove the Blood Shield around their bodies. We must not let them charge into our ranks!” the fox elder reminded the few Spellcasters beside him loudly. He muttered for a moment and dispelled the Blood Shield magic from a few of the Twin-headed Horse Spiders.</p> <p>According to the historical records, the Twin-headed Horse Spiders were a mutated Magical Beast cursed by the Demon God of Hell. They not only possessed immense strength and had precise attacks, they were also naturally equipped with the Blood Shield spell and could reflect fifty percent of the close-range damage done to them. They were incredibly powerful. The outcome would be disastrous if the spiders reached their ranks.</p> <p>At the critical moment, the Ogres and Bullmen stepped forward!</p> <p>After a roar, a five mile radius of the Bloodthirsty Ring of Light appeared from the body of the Twin-headed Ogre Braska, scattering continuously. Soon, the few hundred Ogres all slipped into a bloodthirsty frenzy.</p> <p>Their powerful muscles bulged up, and their thick veins became clearly visible. It was as if they had expanded in an instant, their eyes turning red with bloodthirst. They raised their giant clubs and stepped forward. They smashed the heads of the Twin-headed Horse Spiders leading the pack with a mere strike.</p> <p>In front of absolute power, everything else was but an empty threat!</p> <p>The Ogres were already a powerful race famed for their massive strength, but after slipping into a Bloodthirsty Frenzy, their strength reached unprecedented levels. They smashed their clubs down so quickly that even the air crackled. Even though the Blood Shield on the Twin-headed Horse Spiders could reduce fifty percent of all close-range damage, they still could not take the full power of the Ogres.</p> <p>In front of the fierce Twin-headed Horse Spiders, if the Ogres were like a meat wall, then the ferocious Bullmen were a sharp blade.</p> <p>Under the command of the ox chief, a few hundred Bullmen neatly released waves upon waves of shockwave-like attacks. Within a ten step radius, the stomachs of the sieging Twin-headed Horse Spiders were all sliced open, as if they had come into contact with a sharp cleaver.</p> <p>After the impact wave, the Bullmen also had an ability called the War Trample. Slamming the ground with their heavy war halberds, they immediately released a circle of tremors. Within a thirty step radius, the sieging Twin-headed Horse Spiders staggered as if hit by something heavy, all of them becoming dizzy and giving the Ogres an opportunity to pick them off.</p> <p>There were many types of Beastmen, and even the fox elder was unsure of how many splinter races there were. Amongst the many powerful races, in terms of their ability in large scale battles, no one would dare claim to be better than the Bullmen. Even the powerful Sparton Lionmen were no exception.</p> <p>Two thousand years ago, the first king of the Rossi Empire, Aston Vela, had once said that if the Beastmen had an army of twenty thousand Bullmen, they would be able to establish an independent nation even without Sage level experts. If the Beastmen had eighty thousand elite Bullmen warriors, they would be able to occupy the richest Bavaria Plains in the Tailun Continent.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Creator was fair. The Bullmen were immensely powerful, but their numbers were nothing to boast about.</p> <p>Over the millennia, faced with the frequent wars and the terrible living conditions, they were not only unable to proliferate and prosper, their numbers instead declined over the years. In the entire Tailun Continent, even with the old and weak, their numbers totaled only about ten thousand, scattered in various parts of the wilderness.</p> <p>After forcefully stopping the first wave of attacks from their opponents, the Ogres and Bullmen launched a unified counter attack. Soon, they worked together with one another seamlessly. The Ogres were responsible for stopping the advances of the Twin-headed Horse Spiders, slamming their heads in with their clubs, while the Bullmen quickly followed up with their giant halberds in hand, immediately slicing the necks of the enemy with one strike.</p> <p>On the battlefield, the Twin-headed Ogre and the ox chief were formidable and exceptionally eye-catching!</p> <p>The Twin-headed Ogre maintained the Bloodthirsty Ring of Light. Wherever he passed, both Ogres and the Bullmen slipped into a frenzy. The ox chief cast the Endurance Ring of Light. Wherever it passed, the warriors felt energized, their bodies filled with stamina.</p> <p>The Ogres were in a bloodthirsty frenzy and killed with every strike, while the Bullmen had their impact waves and War Trample, coupled with the Endurance Ring of Light…</p> <p>The synergy between the different units in battle was fully displayed at the present moment!</p> <p>From a bird’s eye view above the tunnel, the eight-legged Twin-headed Horse Spiders with their immense charging abilities seemed to be slamming themselves into a wall of steel, unable to advance. There was no use for their sharp fangs.</p> <p>The spiders had immense strength. If they had encountered the elf archers, they would have killed off a large portion of them in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, the units they encountered were the strong Ogres!</p> <p>The Twin-headed Horse Spiders had sharp fangs, able to bite off even sharp blades, much less human flesh. Unfortunately, they encountered the Bullmen, touted as the best infantry units in the world!</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Seeing the Twin-headed Horse Spiders suffering heavy casualties, their formation in disarray, Yang Ling and the rest heaved a collective sigh of relief. But just as they were prepared to wipe the cold sweat off their foreheads, another angry roar came suddenly from deep within the cave. In that moment, the Twin-headed Horse Spiders seemed to have been urged on, roaring as they charged forward, unafraid of death. Even if they died, they would take a bite out of the Ogres and Bullmen.</p> <p>Bloodthirst, mania, death…</p> <p>Under the agitation of the roar, the Twin-headed Horse Spiders attacked insanely as if having lost their rational thought. A thick layer of Blood Shield formed around their bodies.</p> <p>Smashing down, the Ogres seemed to have hit the shell of a thousand-year-old turtle. Even if they were able to disorientate the spiders, they often shook in recoil, the flow of their blood reversing. After a few recoils, some of the Ogres even started to bleed from the mouth, as if they had suffered serious internal injuries.</p> <p>They would suffer half of the damage they inflicted as recoil. The outcome was rather serious if they were unable to kill with a single blow. It was lucky that the Ogres had thick hides and muscles and their life force was incredibly rich. If they had been the elf archers, they might have taken out their Twin-headed Horse Spiders at the expense of losing their own forces.</p> <p>With the mutation, the pressure on the Ogres and Bullmen increased. Some of them were sent flying back by the bestial Twin-headed Horse Spiders, and some bled incessantly after they got bitten by the dying spiders. Seeing the strange situation, the Twin-headed Ogre and the ox chief attacked with all their might, making their way around the battlefield as they led the group in retaliation against the spider’s counterattack.</p> <p>“Goode, heal the injured, quick!”</p> <p>Faced with the crazed counterattacks of the Twin-headed Horse Spiders, Yang Ling didn’t waste time. He immediately sent forward the barbarians who were guarding their back. He then mobilized a team of Dogmen to bring the injured Ogres and Bullmen back in the main formation while getting Goode and the other Spellcasters to administer first aid.</p> <p>Seeing how powerful the Bullmen were, Yang Ling had an idea. He hoped to form a team of heavy infantry with the Ogres and Bullmen as its main forces until he tamed a large group of Magical Beasts who mainly utilized close combat. This unit would be responsible for taking the front line. With their exceptional abilities when it came to close combat, their battle abilities would be unimaginable if they were wearing heavy armor tailored for them!</p> <p>Letting out fierce roars, the barbarians lifted their giant axes and charged into the battlefield. They formed teams of five under the commands of their leader and joined forces against the bestial Twin-headed Horse Spiders.</p> <p>Compared to the Ogres and Bullmen, while they were slightly weaker in terms of pure strength, they had an advantage in speed and alarming explosive power. Their violent charges also subjected the Twin-headed Horse Spiders to various torments.</p> <p>Under the cover of the Dogmen, Medusas, and elf archers, Spellcasters such as Goode and the fox elder cast various spells, attacking the Twin-headed Horse Spiders that could not charge over to them. Walls of fire, icicles, lightning… The variety of spells were endless!</p> <p>As Great Spellcasters, the Magical Energy of Goode and the fox elder were roughly equal. The two of them took turns, casting the Regeneration Spell on the injured Ogres and Bullmen.</p> <p>Magical Beast Blood Orbs were a condensed form of a Magical Beast’s life essence. It could not only quickly replenish Blood Essence and Wizard Power, it could also replenish a person’s life force and Magical Powers. Seeing that many Ogres and Bullmen were injured, Yang Ling did not hesitate to take out a large bunch of precious Magical Beast Blood Orbs for Goode and the rest to consume.</p> <p>At the beginning of the battle, the Bloodthirsty Ring of Light released by the Twin-headed Ogre Braska had stolen the show. At the later stages, the Endurance Ring of Light cast by the ox chief became the warriors’ best backup.</p> <p>The ox chief made his way around the battlefield continuously. Anyone, be it the Ogres, barbarians, or Bullmen, felt energized after they came into contact with the Endurance Ring of Light, most of their strength recovering in an instant.</p> <p>Bloodthirsty Frenzy, Endurance Ring of Light, and the assistance and healing of the Spellcasters. With this much powerful backup, the brave warriors attacked recklessly, tightly securing the advantage.</p> <p>When Yang Ling waved his hands and sent out the Medusas, touted as the Rulers of Blades, the Twin-headed Horse Spiders were even less of a match, losing the battle steadily. Even the frequent roars of fury from deep within the cave did nothing to alleviate the situation!</p> <p>Suffering heavy casualties, the Twin-headed Horse Spiders retreated like the tide, leaving behind a few thousand of their corpses. They left as quickly as they had come, vanishing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was hesitating on whether or not to send a team of brave warriors to race after them, a small dog-sized Nine-tailed Fox leapt out from the tunnel on the right, flashing by them while dragging its nine radiant tails. It disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye. Yang Ling was unable to determine where it had gone even though he had advanced to the level of Earth Wizard.</p> <p>“The Nine-tailed Heavenly Fox. Oh god, to think that I could witness the fabled Nine-tailed Heavenly Fox!”</p> <p>Rubbing his eyes, the fox elder trembled in excitement, thinking back to the ancient legend in his tribe. He charged out without caution, hoping that he could find the Nine-tailed Fox that had mysteriously disappeared. In his daze, he tripped on the corpse of a Twin-headed Horse Spider, coming to his senses only after he fell heavily on the ground. Thinking back to the ancient legend, he realized something, and his expression changed in the blink of an eye.</p>",
  "Chapter 132: Strange Desert": "<p>“Not good, sir! We have to retreat quickly!” the fox elder shouted, but unfortunately, it was too late.</p> <p>The group saw a silver light flash past their eyes, then the scenery around them changed drastically. The cave disappeared, and they arrived in a desert. The desert was endless, without water, without wind. It was still all around.</p> <p>With the strange transformation, everyone from the powerful Bullmen to the ordinarily composed Medusas all became immensely fearful. No one understood what was going on.</p> <p>“Get into formation, quick!”</p> <p>After his surprise, Yang Ling gave a composed order. Even though he did not understand what was going on, he had a feeling that a tempest was approaching him. He was prepared to engage defensively with the formation, reacting to any changes with his passivity. Of course, it was imperative that he send out scouts to find out about the terrain around them, in case they got ambushed.</p> <p>In their fear, the group acted quickly, forming a tight oval-shaped formation of defense. The Bullmen, Ogres, Medusas, and barbarians were each responsible for a direction, protecting the elf archers and Spellcasters within the circle.</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling preparing to send out his scouts, the fox elder let out a frustrated sigh before slowly explaining the situation.</p> <p>“Sir, this is a Magical Illusory Spell Formation. We have to find a way to get out as soon as possible. Otherwise, even if we don’t suffer an attack, we’ll be stranded here until we die!”</p> <p>Legend had it that there were no intelligent races on the Tailun Continent during the prehistoric times. Then, after the God of War descended, he created angels using light, Beastmen using fire, humans using mud, and all the other creatures using water…</p> <p>According to the historical records, there had been many splinter races of the fox tribe during the ancient times, of which the Heavenly Foxes were the most powerful. Unlike the ordinary Beastmen, the first generation of Heavenly Foxes looked similar to ordinary Fire Foxes, but they had the possibility of evolving into a human form after they developed nine tails.</p> <p>It was rumored that when he was creating the Heavenly Foxes, the God of War had infused them with a drop of his own Blood Essence. In order to absorb the immense energy that they were born with, they had no choice but to undergo thousands of years of evolution within the body of a Fire Fox.</p> <p>Every Heavenly Fox could be said to be a lucky fox naturally imbued with the blessings of the God of War. They naturally possessed massive amounts of fire element Magical Energy, and each of them was an impeccable fire element Spellcaster. They could even use the lowest level fireball spells to terrifying extents.</p> <p>Other than fire element magic, the Heavenly Foxes also had a revered ability—the Magical Illusory Spell Formation. They could create a dream-like Magical Spell Formation. The outcome was disastrous if an outsider accidentally stepped into one of their intricate traps. They would either be attacked by the Heavenly Foxes or trapped in the Magical Illusory Spell Formation until they died of hunger.</p> <p>“It is rumored that in ancient times, the Beastmen were massacred by the Church in the name of exterminating cults. Our population rapidly decreased from tens of millions to just over a million, and the lives of all who survived were in constant risk.” The eyes of the fox elder turned red as he tightened his grip on his staff. He continued, “At the critical moment, a Heavenly Fox living in seclusion stepped forward, took a risk, and lured the Sage level fighters of the Church into an intricately set Magical Illusory Spell Formation, finally perishing there with them. It sacrificed its life as the price for the ceasefire between the Beastmen and the Church!”</p> <p>“That’s right! It was because of the efforts of the Heavenly Fox that we the Beastmen race could sign a ceasefire agreement with the hypocritical Church of the humans. Over the millennia, despite the vile living conditions, we still proliferated, generation after generation!” The Medusa leader paused, then continued, “From then on, the fox tribe has received the respect of all of the Beastmen!”</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling asked in confusion, “Since the Heavenly Fox is also part of the Beastmen tribe, then why would it appear here and trap us in this Magical Illusory Spell Formation?”</p> <p>Yang Ling was confused, unable to understand the situation. The Beastmen looked at each other, no one knowing what was going on. The ox chief scratched his head in frustration, while the Medusa leader had a grim expression, not saying a word. Even the old fox elder could not find a reasonable explanation, despite trying to remember all of the historical records he had read in the past.</p> <p>Seeing the Beastmen unable to come up with an idea despite their discussions, Yang Ling could only sit down on the ground, cross-legged. He summoned a dozen Horned Bee Beasts and instructed them to form groups of three. He then sent them in all four directions to scout the surrounding terrain, and to discover if they were really in a Magical Illusory Spell Formation.</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts were speedy, but they still didn’t find the end of the desert even after flying for an hour. The land had no signs of life, not even a blade of grass, much less any monsters.</p> <p>Other than the golden sand on the ground, the desert only consisted of more, boundless, golden sand!</p> <p>As the images sent back by the Horned Bee Beasts became more and more hazy, Yang Ling felt that it was becoming harder and harder to control them. He realized that they had already reached the largest distance at which he was still able to control them. Without a choice, all he could do was call them back.</p> <p>Could this be a large scale, high level Maze Formation?</p> <p>Thinking back to the strange desert that had suddenly appeared, then looking at the vast stretches of golden sand, Yang Ling had a thought. According to the explanation on the stele, when one cultivated to a high level, they could set up large scale Maze Formations using their Wizard Techniques, creating dream-like traps.</p> <p>“Oh no. What is that?”</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was prepared to investigate the area further, an eagle-eyed elf archer suddenly shouted in shock. Lifting his head to take a look, he saw a line of black figures suddenly appearing in the horizon, bringing with them a sky full of dust.</p> <p>The black figures were fast, soon revealing their ferocious identities. It was not a flood, but a tide of Twin-headed Horse Spiders, without an end in sight.</p> <p>“Retreat, we have to retreat now!”</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, where did this many Twin-headed Horse Spiders come from? Could this desert be their hive?”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Seeing the endless swarm of Twin-headed Horse Spiders approaching them, the group was immensely fearful, and even the powerful Bullmen were no exception. Their hearts thumped wildly, their limbs turned numb.</p> <p>“Tighten the formation, quick!”</p> <p>After swallowing with difficulty, Yang Ling gave a decisive order. In the boundless desert, they would eventually die of exhaustion even if they managed to outrun the Twin-headed Horse Spiders. Rather than retreat in fear, it was better for them to defend themselves where they stood and find a way to dispel this detestable Magical Illusory Spell Formation as soon as possible.</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, the huddling Beastmen seemed to have found an anchor. Under the agitation of the Twin-headed Ogre Braska, they once again slipped into a Bloodthirsty Frenzy, fiercely flailing the weapons in their hands. The Spellcasters such as Goode and the fox elder also weren’t waiting around as they hurriedly cast a magical shield for the warriors in the outer ring.</p> <p>The Twin-headed Horse Spiders were speedy, splitting into two groups and surrounding Yang Ling’s forces soon after. After letting out a strange, ear-piercing sound, they unleashed waves of attacks, unafraid of death. They would chomp down on the bodies of the brave warriors even if they died.</p> <p>Just as they were retaliating with all their might, the people witnessed a strange scene!</p> <p>They would bleed immediately if they were bitten by a Twin-headed Horse Spider, but if the spiders were killed, they merely vanished into thin air, not leaving a trace!</p> <p>Could these monsters have received the curse of Hell?</p> <p>Seeing the strange sight, the group lost their color in shock, sweat covering their bodies. They became more and more uneasy as the battle went on. According to the ancient legends, there was no way to kill a monster cursed by the Demon God of Hell. They could quickly regenerate in the Altar of the Demon God then charge out once again.</p> <p>While they were distracted by panic, a few barbarians and Bullmen met their doom in the blink of an eye, their corpses dragged out by the Twin-headed Horse Spiders before being torn to shreds in an instant. Seeing the fresh red blood, the still-twitching dismembered limbs, and the white brain matter, some of the pale elf archers vomited on the spot, their legs becoming limp.</p> <p>“Sir, what are we going to do?” In his fear, the fox elder looked nervously at Yang Ling. He only had a shred of hope left in his heart, and that was for Yang Ling to summon his Magical Beast army and hopefully fight back against the horde of Twin-headed Horse Spiders.</p> <p>What do I do?</p> <p>Seeing the dead Twin-headed Horse Spiders eerily vanish into thin air, Yang Ling felt his scalp turn numb. He knew that summoning his Magical Beast army now would not have too much of an impact. The crux of the issue still lay in how they were going to dispel this strange Magical Illusory Spell Formation.</p> <p>Could all of this be an illusion? Is the entire desert just a large scale Maze Formation designed to kill us?</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, thinking back to the explanation on the stele, Yang Ling had a thought. Without hesitation, he immediately sat down cross-legged and injected the Wizard Power in his body into the desert.</p> <p>After infusing a large amount of Wizard Power into the desert, Yang Ling’s powerful mental energy spread outward as if it were a spider’s web. The mental energy swam within the vast sea of sand, spreading outward without any obstructions…</p> <p>Golden sand, boundless golden sand!</p> <p>Some time later, after passing through various dunes of sand, after spreading past the vast nothingness, Yang Ling’s body suddenly shook. He felt as though his mental energy had encountered a layer of glue, unable to advance for the longest time.</p> <p>Could the Spell Coordinate of the Magical Illusory Spell Formation be behind this obstacle?</p> <p>After his surprise, Yang Ling put in all of his effort. His small Wizard Core pulsed in agitation, infusing a large amount of Wizard Power into the vast desert. His powerful mental energy also scattered outward as a result.</p> <p>Feeling Yang Ling trying his best, the Heavenly Fox that was hidden somewhere seemed to also have increased its intensity. In that instant, the color of the sky turned darker, and a wild wind blew. The attacks of the Twin-headed Horse Spiders became more insane, and the glue obstructing Yang Ling’s mental energy became thicker. After trying for a moment, Yang Ling noticed that not only was his mental energy unable to advance, it was being pushed back little by little.</p> <p>Hmph, so I was right!</p> <p>Feeling that his mental energy was being forced back, Yang Ling was not alarmed, but elated. If the Heavenly Fox was trying its best to counter him, it meant that he had actually found the Spell Coordinate. As long as he could scatter the Heavenly Fox’s mental energy, he could probably dispel this Magical Illusory Spell Formation.</p> <p>Rather than attack in all directions, he might as well focus his efforts on this point!</p> <p>Deliberating for a moment, he came up with an idea. He suddenly retracted the mental energy he had scattered outward then focused his attacks on that point. As expected, the Heavenly Fox was caught off guard, and his mental energy managed to gain significant ground in a short amount of time.</p> <p>Successfully breaking through and gaining distance, Yang Ling could faintly see a round, fire red ball. It looked like a miniature sun, or the Essence Crystal of some Magical Beast.</p> <p>Could this be the true Spell Coordinate?</p> <p>In his joy, Yang Ling once again increased the intensity of his attack, letting his powerful mental energy burst forth, hoping that he would be able to charge through in one move and destroy the fire red ball. Unexpectedly, his enemy cried out and retaliated with all its might. In that instant, Yang Ling felt as though he had been hit by a hammer, or as if his brain had been bitten by ten thousand ants. It was an intense pain!</p> <p>In the instant Yang Ling suffered from the trauma, the light in the desert grew dim, and all of the Twin-headed Horse Spiders mysteriously stopped moving, becoming still as statues.</p> <p>With the sudden transformation, the group became fearful, not understanding what was going on. They were afraid that some monster would suddenly emerge. Only the fox elder who was familiar with the historical records had a thought and glanced at Yang Ling with a look of understanding.</p> <p>As everyone was overly-nervous, no one noticed the soul ring on Yang Ling’s finger releasing faint traces of silver light, charging into Yang Ling’s brain, fast as lightning. No one noticed that the pagoda-shaped mark between Yang Ling’s brows was becoming clearer and clearer, as images of fierce lifelike beasts appeared.</p>",
  "Chapter 133: Dolphin Sonar": "<p>Just as Yang Ling felt that his head would burst into pieces because of the pain, the Soul Ring on his finger released bolts of refreshing energy. After the energy circulated around his brain, his brain quickly started to calm down.</p> <p>Also, a large amount of Chaotic Energy started rushing out of the pagoda-shaped mark in the middle of his brows, circulating quickly around his Wizard Core whose energy was about to be depleted. It not only provided the core with a large amount of pure Wizard Power, it also supplied him with a continuous source of mental energy.</p> <p>With the Soul Ring and Wizard’s Pagoda as his source of backup, Yang Ling quickly calmed down. He not only remained steady in the face of the Heavenly Fox’s massive mental energy, he instead sent back wave after wave of attacks. His massive mental energy sometimes turned into millions of threads, attacking from all directions, and at other times, it became concentrated, forming the shape of a slender snake as it focused its attacks on a singular point.</p> <p>Faintly, he knew that as long as he broke past the fox’s defense and directly destroyed the red orb that seemed like a Magical Beast Essence Crystal, he could perhaps directly dispel this massive Magical Illusory Spell Formation.</p> <p>Against Yang Ling’s powerful mental attacks, the Heavenly Fox suffered greatly, having no choice but to defend with all its might. Slowly, thin cracks appeared on the petrified bodies of the Twin-headed Horse Spiders in the desert, their color becoming duller and duller.</p> <p>Just like that, Yang Ling attacked with all his might, while the Heavenly Fox defended with its utmost effort. For the time being, Yang Ling was unable to break through the defenses, while the Heavenly Fox was unable to cause any fatal harm to Yang Ling. The two parties slowly reached a stalemate.</p> <p>When the Heavenly Fox had the upper hand, the sky would slowly turn clear and the Twin-headed Horse Spiders would sometimes move their eyes, some even taking half a step forward. When Yang Ling had the advantage, the sky would turn dark, sometimes so dark that one could not see their fingers in front of them. The cracks on the bodies of the Twin-headed Horse Spider would also become bigger.</p> <p>Seeing the sky alternate between light and dark, looking at the strange Twin-headed Horse Spiders, the Beastmen became more and more uneasy. They could not understand what was going on no matter how hard they tried.</p> <p>“Elder, let’s leave this place as soon as possible!”</p> <p>“That’s right! Even though we might not be able to escape this strange desert in a short span of time, it is still better than continually facing these mutated spiders!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Swallowing with difficulty, the Beastmen engaged in discussion. The Beastmen would not be this afraid if the Twin-headed Horse Spiders remained motionless, or were even charging manically toward them. But they felt that the situation was eerier, seeing that the mutated spiders were sometimes moving their eyes. They could not help but think about the various terrifying legends that they had heard.</p> <p>It was rumored that there was a tunnel in the Tailun Continent that was linked directly to the Demonic Plane, where the ground was covered in flames. There was a terrifying Demon God of Hell there. He could easily tear a giant dragon in two with his bare hands, and his magic could turn an entire sea into ice or burn all living things into ashes. His curses would even cause the angels residing in the City Amongst the Clouds to tremble!</p> <p>Legend had it that after being inflicted with the curse of the Demon God of Hell, all creatures, be it intelligent beings or Magical Beasts, would become puppets that had lost rational thought. They could be reborn time and time again at the Altar of the Demon God. Against such mutated beings, it was rumored that other than using the Ultimate Purification of Saint Light from the Church, even Sage level experts would be unable to directly destroy them.</p> <p>“No, staying by the side of the leader is the only hope we have of escaping this place alive!”</p> <p>The group was in a heated discussion, all hoping that they could leave this strange place as soon as possible. Even the ox chief and Medusa leader wanted to flee. Only the fox elder, who seemed to be thinking about something, expressed his disagreement loudly.</p> <p>Feeling a strange ripple in the air, then looking at the Twin-headed Horse Spiders that had strangely stopped all of a sudden, he knew that Yang Ling was using a magic that he was not familiar with in an attempt to dispel the Magical Illusory Spell Formation. Until they found a real opportunity, leaving would not be a wise decision. Staying behind and observing the situation was the best course of action!</p> <p>There was fear in their hearts, but with the insistence of the respected fox elder, the Beastmen staid where they were, protecting Yang Ling heavily along with the Ogres, barbarians, and elf archers. Even though they did not understand what was going on, they knew that Yang Ling was their greatest hope when it came to dispelling this illusion.</p> <p>Is this prolonged battle the only way?</p> <p>Yang Ling could not help but crease his brows, seeing that he was unable to break through even after an hour had passed. Even though his Wizard’s Pagoda had supplied him with a massive amount of energy, expending it indefinitely was not a good plan!</p> <p>According to the explanations on the stele, there were a variety of Wizard Techniques that could dispel the various Wizard Formations, but unfortunately, they were all high level Wizard Techniques, and there was no way Yang Ling could use them at this point in time. Advancing to the level of Earth Wizard, he should be able to cultivate a few mid level Wizard Techniques with his Wizard Core, but there was no way he could start cultivating those techniques now. Other than the Wizard Amulets he had created in the past, he had no way to attack!</p> <p>Oh wait. Wizard Amulets.</p> <p>Thinking about the Wizard Amulets in his Space Ring, Yang Ling realized something. He recalled the Dolphin Sonar Wizard Amulet that could be used to attack the mind of an enemy. This Wizard Amulet was made using the Blood Essence of the Bugu Bird could directly attack the soul of a person with a powerful soundwave. He had almost turned the barbarians passing by into idiots when he was creating the Wizard Amulets. Perhaps it might have an unexpected effect when it came to dealing with this detestable Heavenly Fox!</p> <p>“Quick, all of you dig down into the desert and block your ears tightly!” After coming to a decision, Yang Ling quickly took out the twenty-some Dolphin Sonar Wizard Amulets he had left and instructed the group to block their ears.</p> <p>Dig down into the desert and block our ears tightly?</p> <p>The Orges, barbarians, and elf archers quickly followed the instructions, but the Beastmen hesitated for a moment. After a moment’s discussion, they followed Yang Ling’s instructions under the orders of the fox elder, tearing off their clothes to cover their ears, then clenching their teeth as they dug under the sand.</p> <p>The group had just dived into the sand when Yang Ling rushed to activate the first Dolphin Sonar Wizard Amulet. It released a loud, powerful, extremely high-pitched screech, spreading far and wide.</p> <p>In that instant, everyone felt their eardrums shake, as if a ball of heavy mercury had entered their ears. Waves of piercing pain attacked their brains, as if they had been hit by a hammer.</p> <p>The people felt waves of discomfort, while the Heavenly Fox that was the target of the attack was caught off guard. As it let out a scream, the sky turned pitch dark, while the unmoving Twin-headed Horse Spiders flickered strangely, their colors quickly turning dull. Weblike cracks appeared on their bodies.</p> <p>“Hmph, die!”</p> <p>Feeling the reduction in pressure and how his mental energy had gained a significant distance, Yang Ling was elated. He had found another method of attacking his opponent. Letting out a cold grunt, Yang Ling quickly activated one Dolphin Sonar Wizard Amulet after another, while using his mental energy to focus his attacks on a single point, clenching his teeth as he went all out.</p> <p>Under the full brunt of Yang Ling’s attacks, the Heavenly Fox had to retreat. Waves of fearful screams came from the sky as the cracks on the bodies of the Twin-headed Horse Spiders became increasingly larger. In fact, their entire unmoving bodies started to shake. Faintly, Yang Ling could once again see the Essence Crystal-like flame orb.</p> <p>Success or failure depends on this attack!</p> <p>Letting out a low grunt, Yang Ling instantly activated the remainder of his Dolphin Sonar Wizard Amulets. In that instant, the Beastmen who were covering their ears and hiding under the sand let out a unified grunt, while the Heavenly Fox who took the brunt of the attack let out a pathetic cry.</p> <p>Suffering from the heavy trauma, the mental energy of the Heavenly Fox decreased dramatically. This way, Yang Ling’s massive mental energy seemed to have entered uncharted land, slamming heavily into the Essence Crystal-like ball of fire.</p> <p>A pathetic wail came from the sky, its pitch shrill and piercing, as if it were feeling pain straight from the bones. It seemed as though it was a pathetic wail originating straight from the soul. After a manic wind blew past, the Twin-headed Horse Spiders that were covered in cracks flickered as they disappeared into thin air. Following that, a crisp sound rang out as the vast desert scattered.</p> <p>After rubbing their eyes, the group instantly noticed that they had returned to the cave. Nothing had changed from before other than the few corpses of the Bullmen and Ogres not far away. It was as if whatever had happened just now was only a nightmare!</p> <p>“Hmph, where else are you going to run off to?”</p> <p>The group felt as though they had just been in a nightmare, not noticing anything different, but Yang Ling had quickly located the Nine-tailed Heavenly Fox. It had squirmed into a dark corner and was preparing to sneak away quietly. He took out a sharp dagger from within his Space Ring and formed the hand gestures for the Earth Evasion technique, instantly appearing before it!</p> <p>“Sir, please wait!”</p> <p>Seeing that the heavily injured Heavenly Fox was unable to dodge and was about to die in Yang Ling’s hands, the fox elder shouted out in worry. Over the past thousand years, there had been no traces of a Heavenly Fox in the Tailun Continent. Even though this Heavenly Fox had subjected the group to much pain, the fox elder was unable to accept that a Heavenly Fox would die before his eyes.</p> <p>Wait?</p> <p>With the request of the fox elder, Yang Ling noticed that the Heavenly Fox was bleeding from the mouth and having difficulty walking. Then Yang Ling remembered its strange ability. He moved his dagger gently across his index finger, then pressed it tightly to the fox’s forehead.</p> <p>In that instant, mysterious symbols appeared on the body of the puppy-sized Heavenly Fox. But unlike the past, it took more than ten times longer than it usually did, and the mysterious symbols sometimes formed a packed forest, sometimes a vast galaxy, and at others an ancient temple…</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was feeling exhausted, his energy almost depleted, the Heavenly Fox was enveloped by a ball of silver light and finally disappeared without a trace, automatically getting recalled to the mysterious space containing the Wizard’s Pagoda.</p> <p>“Sir, ah, what exactly happened?” The fox elder was incredibly worried, seeing the legendary Heavenly Fox disappear into thin air.</p> <p>It was rumored that a few thousand years ago, the last Heavenly Fox had said that they had found a new continent overseas before it vanished. It said that there were no wars, no disease, no greedy and cruel humans, and that they would bring their entire clan over. They would then return and bring all of the Beastmen over when the time was right.</p> <p>Unfortunately, thousands of years had passed in the blink of an eye, and there was no longer any news or traces of the Heavenly Foxes!</p> <p>Some said that they had moved to a faraway plane and were unable to return; others said that they suffered surprise attacks from powerful fighters from the Church before they left and were exterminated. There were also some that said that they were carefree and had no trouble in the world overseas, and they had long forgotten the suffering Beastmen on the Tailun Continent!</p> <p>The Heavenly Foxes were not at Sage level, but they were powerful fighters that were rare within the Beastmen. If there was a tribe of Heavenly Foxes on the Tailun Continent, the Beastmen might not have landed in such a plight today.</p> <p>No matter what, the fox elder could not accept that the Heavenly Fox would disappear before his eyes in an instant when it had just appeared!</p> <p>Originally, Yang Ling was prepared to summon the Heavenly Fox he had tamed, but seeing the worried fox elder, he had a thought and changed his mind at the last minute. He put on a mysterious air and said, “Elder, could the Heavenly Fox have been taken away by the so called Demon God of Hell?”</p> <p>The most important thing now was to deal with the monster in the cave. He did not wish to cause trouble over the Heavenly Fox and affect the relationship between himself and the Beastmen. Furthermore, he did not understand how a small Heavenly Fox like that would be able to take out Sage level fighters and force the powerful Church to sign a ceasefire agreement with them.</p> <p>Even though the abilities of the Heavenly Fox were unique, almost managing to kill the group by trapping them within the Magical Illusory Spell Formation, he did not feel that the Heavenly Fox was powerful enough to be described as unparalleled. He could not understand why the Beastmen would place such high hopes on a puppy-like creature.</p> <p>Taken away by the Demon God of Hell?</p> <p>After his shock, the face of the fox elder turned pale. But seeing Yang Ling sitting cross-legged on the ground, recalling how he had dripped a drop of his blood on the body of the Heavenly Fox, then thinking about his identity as a Summoner, he felt as though something was off!</p>",
  "Chapter 134: Natural Allure": "<p>The more the fox elder thought about it, the more he felt that something was off. In the desert, the Twin-headed Horse Spiders had disappeared into thin air, but that was just because they were illusions. There was no way that the Heavenly Fox would instantly disappear for no rhyme or reason. Furthermore, the Demon God of Hell was but a fleeting legend. Even if there were a demon like that, surely it wouldn’t have coincidentally abducted the heavily injured Heavenly Fox!</p> <p>The only possibility was that Yang Ling had tampered with something!</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, the fox elder said in a roundabout way, “Sir, the Heavenly Fox race is very important to us Beastmen. Do you think that you could…”</p> <p>Seeing the fox elder looking at him nervously, Yang Ling knew that he could no longer hide it from this old fox. He deliberated for a moment, and instead of saying anything, he simply summoned the Heavenly Fox he had just tamed.</p> <p>In the end, the summoning produced shocking results!</p> <p>After a red glow flashed past, a lady suddenly appeared within the cave. She had long hair and bare legs, revealing a large area of fair skin. She was covered from head to toe with a fatal allure!</p> <p>“Yuna pays her respects to her master!”</p> <p>Just as the group was in shock, the teenage lady gently bowed before Yang Ling. In that instant, Yang Ling caught a fragrance wafting toward him.</p> <p>Master? Could this be that puppy-sized Heavenly Fox?</p> <p>Looking at the alluring skin of the lady’s chest, her elegant curves, and the small fox’s tail above her buttocks, Yang Ling let out a disbelieving smile as he shook his head. He did not expect to summon a beauty after taming a Heavenly Fox!</p> <p>He had not expected to unintentionally tame a female servant, a female servant filled with a fatal breath-taking allure!</p> <p>Yang Ling was shocked, while the Beastmen took the longest time to come to their senses. This was especially so for the fox elder. He was petrified when he saw the Heavenly Fox kneeling before Yang Ling.</p> <p>He had not expected the Nine-tailed Heavenly Fox to instantly evolve to take a human form, nor did he expect that the sacred Heavenly Fox would call Yang Ling her master!</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling slowly stand up, then looking at the Heavenly Fox still kneeling on the floor, the fox elder swallowed with difficulty. He had felt that something was off when Yang Ling said that the Heavenly Fox had been abducted by the Demon God of Hell. To think that he had guessed correctly!</p> <p>“Your name is Yuna?”</p> <p>Even though he had obtained her memories just like he did when he tamed his other Magical Beasts, Yang Ling still made it a point to ask. Faced with such a beautiful specimen, he was unable to associate her with the rest of the fang-baring Magical Beasts for the time being.</p> <p>“That’s right, Master. I am Yuna from the race of the Heavenly Foxes!” The beautiful teenage lady said as she lifted her head, her dark eyes carrying a tear, invoking pity.</p> <p>“You devil, you dare to corrupt our sacred Heavenly Fox!”</p> <p>When he started to realize what was going on, a violent Bullman charged toward Yang Ling without consideration. He moved fast, and neither the fox elder or the ox chief had time to stop him. The barbarians and Ogres that were standing in the outer circle also could not aid Yang Ling in time.</p> <p>But just as the Bullman was about to launch his attack, without waiting for Yang Ling to act, the beautiful Yuna stood in front of him, duty bound. She instantly cast a petrifying spell by merely moving a finger, turning the impulsive Bullman into a stone statue. The Bullman was unable to move even his eyes, much less any other parts of his body.</p> <p>Seeing the agitated Beastmen, then looking at the silent Yang Ling behind her, the teenage girl Yuna let out a melancholic sigh, then slowly started explaining things.</p> <p>It turned out that just as the historical records of the fox tribe had said, most of the Heavenly Foxes had moved abroad through an ancient Magical Spell Formation. Yuna’s family, however, had been living in a distant glacier when the Heavenly Foxes began leaving the Tailun Continent. By the time Yuna’s ancestors had arrived at the Taildon Valley, where the Magical Spell Formation for traveling was located, the Heavenly Fox that had been responsible for operating the spell had already left.</p> <p>Without a Heavenly Fox to receive them, there was no way that Yuna’s ancestors could have activated the Magical Spell Formation. They were alone and helpless. But the crisis was only beginning!</p> <p>Just as Yuna’s ancestors were about to leave the Taildon Valley and return to the distant glacier, a terrifying mutated Spider Monster suddenly charged in.</p> <p>The Spider Monster was immensely strong, with both incredible physical power and Magical Energy that was strong beyond imagination. In order to protect the slower juniors in the tribe, the only Heavenly Fox that had taken a human form began a life and death battle with the spider.</p> <p>After the fierce battle, even though the Heavenly Fox that had a human form managed to inflict injuries on the terrifying Spider Monster, he also had to pay a heavy price. He was taking his last breaths, and all they had left were the little Heavenly Foxes with little fighting prowess.</p> <p>Just as the Spider Monster was unleashing its bestial instincts and preparing to exterminate the Heavenly Fox tribe attempting to escape the Taildon Valley, another surprise happened!</p> <p>In the process of running fearfully for their lives, a little Heavenly Fox unintentionally hit a small protruding rock. In that instant, all of the rocks within the cave started releasing a strong Seven-colored Light. Following which, a massive Magical Spell Formation appeared within the cavern!</p> <p>After the transformation, the Heavenly Foxes noticed that a ring of Seven-colored Light had appeared at the exit of the cave, and they could not run through it no matter how hard they tried. At the same time, the exit of the cavern started emanating a white fog. The slower Spider Monster would howl in pain every time it came into contact with the fog, and it could not escape no matter what. Just like that, both parties became trapped within the cave.</p> <p>But the crisis was not over for the Heavenly Foxes!</p> <p>After its body had recovered, even though the Spider Monster still couldn’t get out, it came up with a vicious plan. It used its powerful mental ability to continuously and directly attack the souls of the Heavenly Foxes. As they hadn’t evolved to take on a human form, the young Heavenly Foxes did not have any resistance to the attacks, and so they were tortured for a long time.</p> <p>More terrifyingly, the Spider Monster used its massive mental energy to summon a group of powerful spiders in front of the cavern. It not only instructed them to attack the young Heavenly Foxes, it also discovered a secret. The white fog at the exit of the cavern dealt heavy damage to the Spider Monster, but it didn’t have much of an effect on the spiders it summoned.</p> <p>This way, despite not being able to charge out, the Spider Monster could still summon a large number of spiders within the cavern and launch waves upon waves of attacks on the young Heavenly Foxes. The Heavenly Foxes that had been lucky to survive were once again faced with a crisis that threatened to exterminate their tribe!</p> <p>In order to survive, the Heavenly Foxes had no choice but to reach a compromise with the cruel Spider Monster. They had to send a Heavenly Fox that was about to evolve to take a human form into the cavern to serve the disgusting Spider Monster once every few hundred years. This was the reason why the race of Heavenly Foxes still did not have a Heavenly Fox with a human form, despite the passage of a few thousand years. Thus, they had no way of battling the powerful Spider Monster.</p> <p>After understanding what was going on, Yang Ling took off his jacket and draped it gently over the teary Yuna. As he had tamed her, he could clearly see her memories and emotions at any point in time, and he thus felt more deeply Yuna’s grief and sorrow. At this moment, he could no longer think of her as a Magical Beast!</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, let’s charge in and kill the detestable Spider Monster!”</p> <p>“That’s right, charge in and chop it into pieces!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>After learning about the misfortune of Yuna and the rest, the Beastmen were furious, quickly changing their target. Some of the restless Bullmen even roared as they lifted their giant war halberds. If not for the ox chief stopping them, they might have charged in already.</p> <p>After calming down, the fox elder had no choice but to admit that Yuna had already become a creature that Yang Ling could summon. According to the rules of the Summoning Contract, if Yang Ling died, Yuna wouldn’t survive either. The fox elder had to accept the truth. Furthermore, Yang Ling had a massive influence, and his abilities were unbelievably strong. Having a falling out with him would not be wise.</p> <p>“According to my observations, the white fog in the cavern suddenly turned duller over the last few days. The Spider Monster might be able to escape at any time!” Rubbing the tears off her face, Yuna continued, “Now, we have two choices. We can either charge in and kill the Spider Monster, or we leave quickly and get as far away from here as possible!”</p> <p>Even though she was raring to obliterate the Spider Monster deep within the cave, Yuna’s judgment was not clouded. As she spoke, she secretly summoned the members of her tribe that were in hiding. Soon, five puppy-like Heavenly Foxes raced out from the tunnel on the right. Other than one that had evolved six tails, the rest all had five tails.</p> <p>The Spider Monster was too powerful. Yuna knew that she had just evolved to achieve a human form, and she had no time to master many of the high level spells. Charging in rashly would only be inviting her own doom. Furthermore, even if they were going to fight to the death with the monster, she should at the very least settle the rest of the little Heavenly Foxes first.</p> <p>Run as far as possible?</p> <p>Yang Ling didn’t know exactly what abilities a Heavenly Fox with a human form had, but the fox elder was different. According to the historical records, evolving to achieve a human form was a dividing line in the abilities of a Heavenly Fox. After successful evolution, not only would their Magical Energy increase by several multiples, they could also gradually master several powerful abilities. If they trained themselves to a certain degree, it was not impossible for them to face off against a human Sage level fighter.</p> <p>Seeing how Yuna’s expression changed when she spoke of the Spider Monster, he could not imagine how powerful the Spider Monster deep within the cave must be. Unless he had no choice, he would definitely not be willing to cross swords with such a monster. But the Beastmen had proliferated in the Ladak Mountain Rage for thousands of years now. Where would they move to at such short notice?</p> <p>After looking at the Medusa leader and ox chief, no further words had to be spoken before the fox elder understood their concerns.</p> <p>If the Spider Monster escaped from its constraints and summoned a large number of spiders, the entire Ladak Mountain Range might soon become a massive spider hive. Then, the Beastmen who had lived here for thousands of years would be the first to suffer.</p> <p>Yang Ling had promised to treat the Beastmen fairly, but his territory was only a couple hundred miles away from the Taildon Valley. If the Spider Monster escaped, Yang Ling might no even be able to take care of himself. How would he be able to protect the Beastmen that were willing to enter his camp?</p> <p>If this was the summer, they might be able to hide in the Terras Forest that spanned tens of thousands of miles, or perhaps move to the large wasteland outside the Aila Mountain Pass. But with the snow falling from the sky, moving their entire tribe was basically an unimaginable task. Their clansmen might starve to death or freeze on the journey before they even had the chance to be killed by the Spider Monster.</p> <p>The Beastmen could not do anything, and Yang Ling could not find a good idea in such a short span of time!</p> <p>Through Yuna’s memories, he knew something of how terrifying the Spider Monster deep within the cave really was. If this monster managed to leave the cavern, then the safety of Wissen Town would face an unprecedented challenge.</p> <p>Faced with a monster who was powerful beyond imagination, the low level Magical Beasts and Swordsmen were definitely not a match, no matter their numbers. If he was not careful, the effort he had spent in Wissen Town might be destroyed in an instant!</p> <p>Seeing Yuna cradling a small Heavenly Fox, the fox elder said, “Yuna, does the Spider Monster deep within the cave not have any weaknesses?”</p> <p>“Yes. Every month, when the moon is at its roundest, the Magical Spell Formation within the cavern releases a large amount of white fog. Then, the Spider Monster is at its weakest in physical ability, Magical Energy, and even mental energy,” Yuna said furiously, telling everyone the secret that her clansmen had obtained with much difficulty over the millennia.</p>",
  "Chapter 135: Just Who Is the Fox?": "<p>The Spider Monster not only had powerful abilities, it could also summon countless spiders to do battle for it. If it managed to escape its imprisonment, the entire Taildon Valley, or even the entire Ladak Mountain Range would quickly become its territory. The Beastmen who had proliferated here for thousands of years were alone and helpless, with nowhere to go. They might once again be faced with the threat of extinction.</p> <p>The Beastmen understood the Spider Monster’s weakness. They sought to ensure their future survival in the Ladak Mountain Range, and they wished to avenge the Heavenly Foxes. They decided to take a gamble. There were still about three days until the full moon. After they exited the cave, they took the time to discuss the next phase of their plan, committing all their forces to preparing for the battle.</p> <p>The Ox Chief decided to send out a total of five hundred elite Bullmen warriors, and the Fox Elder was prepared to send out twenty Spellcasters and a thousand Dogmen warriors. Even the Medusas who did not have large numbers also sent out about three hundred brave warriors left in their tribe.</p> <p>“Sir, might I ask how many troops you can gather from your territory?” After waiting for some time and seeing that Yang Ling wasn’t declaring a stance, the Fox Elder had no choice but to ask him directly. For the survival and future of the tribe, he was prepared to go all out. Of course, he needed Yang Ling’s full support.</p> <p>“Elder, I am sorry, but faced with a powerful enemy like the Spider Monster, I have no choice but to prioritize the safety of the people in my territory.” After a moment’s deliberation, Yang Ling pretended to be put on the spot, and shook his head. He continued, “I have to return to Wissen Town immediately to set up defenses. At the very most, I can only leave behind a hundred warriors to assist you!”</p> <p>Knowing that there was no way out for the Beastmen, Yang Ling decided to take a step back as a means of advancing. For the safety of Wissen Town and the rich resources in the Taildon Valley, he had to eliminate the powerful Spider Monster; but it was also indispensable that he take this opportunity to fight for greater benefits and gather all of the Beastmen within the Ladak Mountain Range into his territory.</p> <p>The appearance of the Spider Monster was an unprecedented challenge, but it was also a rare opportunity!</p> <p>He believed that as long as he seized the opportunity, he might be able to get the scattered Beastmen tribes to incorporate themselves into his territory in one fell swoop. He would also be able to obtain enough manpower and various supplies quickly.</p> <p>Leave behind at most one hundred warriors to assist us?</p> <p>Seeing Yang Ling’s serious expression, the Fox Elder’s heart felt icy cold. Faced with the powerful Spider Monster, they would not have any chance of victory if they did not have Yang Ling’s full support.</p> <p>After a moment’s deliberation, the Medusa leader said, “Sir, if the Spider Monster was to escape from its imprisonment and summon many spiders to occupy the entirety of the Ladak Mountain Range, I would think that Wissen Town would not be able to survive either!”</p> <p>Hearing that Yang Ling was prepared to recall his army, the Beastmen fell into discussion. Some sat on the ground depressed, and some teared up secretly, worried about the future of their clansmen. Some even glared fiercely at Yang Ling who was sitting cross legged on the ground. They wanted to draw their blades and force him to mobilize his troops. Only the Medusa leader maintained her usual calm.</p> <p>“That’s right. If the Ladak Mountain Range were to be occupied by the Spider Monster, then Wissen Town would not be spared!” Yang Ling admitted, much to the surprise of everyone present. He then continued slowly, “But as a leader, I have to be responsible for the commoners in my territory. I have to think of the worst case scenario even before the battle starts!”</p> <p>As Yang Ling spoke, the Fox Elder seemed to come to terms with something.</p> <p>After a pause, seeing the Beastmen listening intently around him, Yang Ling continued, “I have a majestic castle in Wissen Town. I believe that the spiders would not be able to infiltrate it no matter their numbers if I have a team of elites guarding the castle. The rations I have in my castle are enough to feed everyone in the town for a full year!”</p> <p>The group slipped into commotion. Even though they had heard that one did not have to worry about food and clothing in Wissen Town, no one could have expected Yang Ling to have such a large amount of rations!</p> <p>An elite army, a majestic castle, coupled with sufficient rations…</p> <p>The Beastmen now understood why Yang Ling was so reluctant to fight. But their hearts became heavier after the shock. As a leader, Yang Ling had sufficient resources to tackle the crisis. But what could the Beastmen who had been oppressed by the humans do?</p> <p>The Beastmen had heavy hearts, all of them sighing. Only Goode understood Yang Ling’s intentions. There were indeed a good number of rations left in the Wissen Castle, but it was definitely not large enough to fit everyone in the town for a full year. It was clear that to Goode that Yang Ling had other intentions.</p> <p>After swallowing with difficulty, the Fox Elder still felt wronged. “Sir, even if you are able to defend against the horde of spiders with the tall castle walls, what are you going to use to defend against the powerful Spider Monster? Aren’t you afraid that just the Spider Monster alone would be able to break your castle door?”</p> <p>“Elder, to tell you the truth, I have spent much of my efforts on the castle. Even a Sage level might not be able to break into the castle within a short period of time, much less the Spider Monster!” Yang Ling gave a mysterious smile, then continued. “Furthermore, I have built a pier at the estuary of the Donau River. If I truly cannot hold on any longer, we could retreat by boat and return to my family’s territory.”</p> <p>Yang Ling spoke as he picked up a small, sharp rock. He drew a simplified map of Wissen Town. He drew out the sections like the pier and farms even though construction for these areas had not even been carried out yet. He drew a large piece of territory for the Beastmen, much to the amazement of the tactician Goode. Goode admitted to himself that he was not as shrewd as Yang Ling.</p> <p>“For the future of your tribe, you Beastmen are willing to go all out, unafraid of death. I admire this about you greatly!” Seeing the Beastmen deep in thought around him, Yang Ling then continued, “But you have not spared a thought for the old and injured in your tribe. If you were to fail, or the tribesmen that you had left behind to defend your tribe encountered a group of bandits or Magical Beasts that were out seeking food, what would they do?”</p> <p>After bringing over all of the warriors from the tribe, the rest of the tribesmen would definitely die if they met with any accidents!</p> <p>Even though the Fox Elder, Ox Chief, and Medusa leader had once considered a similar problem, they felt even more uneasy now that Yang Ling had reminded them.</p> <p>The cold harsh winter meant that tribes who were accustomed to snatching the food of others as well as starving Magical Beasts would take the risk and attack every tribe they came across. Even if they triumphed over the terrifying Spider Monster, their remaining tribesmen could meet with accidents. It would not do to lose them all.</p> <p>“After bringing over all of the brave warriors from the tribes, it is best that we gather all of the old and weak from several tribes and defend them all together!” Looking at the Fox Elder, the Medusa leader, and the rest, Yang Ling continued sincerely, “Of course, if you don’t mind the trouble, you could perhaps move the tribesmen who are not going to battle into Wissen Town temporarily.”</p> <p>After a pause, Yang Ling continued, “I cannot guarantee anything else, but I can at least make sure that their basic needs and personal safety are looked after. Even if you were defeated in the battle here at the Taildon Valley, and the Spider Army escaped from its imprisonment, I would have enough time to get them to the boats and move them somewhere else to avert disaster.”</p> <p>The Beastmen were made up of many races. There were not only the powerful Bullmen and Medusas, there was also the fox race that produced many Spellcasters. It was also rumored that there were several smaller tribes with various abilities, each with their own use.</p> <p>Furthermore, because of the intentional attacks and pressures from various parties, all of the Beastmen existed in scattered tribes, unable to form an independent faction. If Yang Ling could find a way to absorb them under his rule one by one, then the abilities of Wissen Town would improve by leaps and bounds. He would not only be able to obtain a large amount of cheap manpower in a short span of time, he would also obtain many talents of various kinds.</p> <p>No matter what, Yang Ling was not going to miss out on this opportunity to strengthen himself. He believed that as long as he could move the old and injured clansmen of the Beastmen into Wissen Town, then it would not be long before the few Beastmen tribes before him would submit to his rule!</p> <p>Because of the precarious situation, coupled with Yang Ling’s effortful invitation and temptation, the Beastmen decided to move their clansmen into Wissen Town after a moment’s discussion. This was so they could head into battle without worry and put all their effort into dealing with the Spider Monster deep within the cave. They did not know that they had unintentionally gotten onto Yang Ling’s carriage one step at a time!</p> <p>Without the worry in the back of their minds, the Beastmen felt their morale boosted, and they grouped quickly together. The Fox Elder took out his precious Black Pulp Melon, the Bullmen put on the heavy armor that their predecessors had left for them and carried their heavy totem poles. As for the Medusas, they brought all of the snake venom that they had accumulated over the decades to the Taildon Valley.</p> <p>The poison techniques of the Medusas were as renowned as their blade techniques. Their poison-coated twin blades were a trauma that the humans and Orcs could never forget. It was rumored that even the most elite Knights of Holy Light from the Church had been unable to scatter the formation of a group of Medusas holding their poison-coated twin blades.</p> <p>Even though the Medusas were powerful, their numbers were unfortunately roughly the same as the Bullmen, or even less. That was the reason they were unable to lead the Beastmen to a true victory and set up a powerful independent Beastmen empire despite all of the great wars.</p> <p>In order to fight in close combat, the Beastmen decided to set up an outpost right outside the cave. With Yang Ling’s help, the land outside of the cave soon became littered with tents. The Beastmen did not have to sleep on top of the thick snow like they had before.</p> <p>After getting people to move the rest of the clansmen to Wissen Town and removing the worry in the back of their minds, the group once again gathered together to discuss the next step of their plan.</p> <p>“Three days. Time is too tight!” The Fox Elder let out a sigh. “If we had a dozen days, we could not only gather the rest of the Beastmen tribes in the Ladak Mountain Range to do battle with us, we could even gather the scattered Beastmen in the large wilderness outside the Aila Mountain Pass to aid us in battle!”</p> <p>“No, Elder, there’s no need for us to wait three days before we attack!” After taking a sip of rum, Yang Ling said softly, “Even though the abilities of the Spider Monster would decrease greatly after three days, it is far from enough. We have to attack immediately!”</p> <p>Hearing Yang Ling say this, even the Heavenly Fox Yuna was confused, much less the Fox Elder, Medusa leader, and the rest. In that instant, no one understood Yang Ling’s intentions.</p> <p>“It is simple; when faced with the Spider Monster whose abilities are imperceptible and deep, we have to try our best to exhaust its abilities. Send brave warriors to enter the fray in waves and launch continuous attacks. Even if they are unable to directly heavily injure the Spider Monster, they will at the very least be able to destroy many of the spiders that it summons. Force it to continuously summon spiders to aid it in battle, indirectly exhausting its stamina, Magical Energy, and mental energy!”</p> <p>According to the explanation of the Heavenly Fox Yuna, there was a white fog at the exit of the hall, and there was no way that the Spider Monster could charge out. If that was the case, the group would be able to attack if they advanced and defend when they retreated as long as they occupied the exit of the hall. They could have the army form several groups and take turns entering the fray to attack, continuously exhausting the abilities of the other party.</p> <p>Yang Ling knew that his plan had already half succeeded after he got the Beastmen to willingly move their elderly, women, and children into Wissen Town. Following this, as long as he planned it well, he might be able to successfully complete his entire plan without having to wait too long.</p> <p>Then, he would no longer have to personally lead an army to clear the insurgents. Instead, he could devote more time and energy into training, as well as free up more time to work on a plan for the rapid development of Wissen Town.</p>",
  "Chapter 136: Rotational Battle": "<p>After some deliberation, the group all agreed with Yang Ling’s opinion. Without wasting time, they immediately split the warriors within the valley into four teams, preparing to rotate between them as they did battle.</p> <p>After smothering their weapons with the snake venom brought over by the Medusas, the first team started to take action. Ogres, Bullmen, barbarians, and Medusas were responsible for close combat, while the Elf archers and Dogmen were tasked with long ranged attacks. They charged in, killing all that was in their path, and secured the area deep within the cave, outside the hall where the white fog billowed.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Seeing the large group of warriors that had charged in, the Spider Monster within the hall let out a loud roar, continuously summoning spiders to aid it in battle. Wave after wave, the spiders launched fierce, frenzied attacks on the group outside the hall.</p> <p>Even though they could not see the Spider Monster, the group was still incredibly nervous after hearing its sky-shaking roar and seeing the horde of spiders that were swarming them like the tide. Luckily, under the leadership of the Fox Elder, they managed to push back the attacks of the other party with difficulty, slowly solidifying their position.</p> <p>Each team of warriors was paired with at least five Spellcasters. Their main mission was to join hands and cast a magical protective barrier, defending the group against the poisonous attacks of the Giant Crab Spiders.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, the Gnomes couldn’t be classified as Spellcasters even though they could use magic spells, as they were only relying on their Magical Spell Formations. But in terms of the speed in which they could cast spells, they did not pale in comparison to the experienced Foxmen Spellcasters, much to the shock of the Fox Elder.</p> <p>Under the protection of the protective barrier, the group intentionally fell back to the entrance of the hall, maintaining a safe distance between themselves and the Spider Monster that could not approach the white fog. They also did this to lure the ordinary spiders toward them, like moths to a flame.</p> <p>After the Dogmen, Elf archers, and Spellcasters dealt with the Giant Crab Spiders that could spew venom, the Bullmen, Ogres, barbarians, and Medusas swarmed forward, manically dispatching the sieging Twin-headed Horse Spiders.</p> <p>The snake venom refined by the Medusas was powerful indeed. Even though they had only applied a thin layer of the poison on their weapons, mere contact would cause the spiders to turn numb immediately, free to be killed.</p> <p>Just like that, the Fox Elder, Ox Chief, Medusa leader, and Goode took turns leading the warriors into battle, continuously exhausting the abilities of the Spider Monster.</p> <p>Even though they could not severely injure the Spider Monster that was hiding behind the ordinary spiders due to the thick fog, nor did they catch a glimpse of its true appearance, they did indeed manage to exhaust its abilities. It had not been too obvious at the start, but after two days, the roars of the Spider Monster became noticeably weaker, and the gaps between its attacks increased. The number of spiders it summoned also decreased as time went by.</p> <p>Two days later, almost all of the warriors from the tribe had arrived. The original four groups were split into eight teams, attacking in rotation. They could not only continuously exhaust the abilities of the Spider Monster, they could also guarantee that the warriors got enough rest, so as to prepare for the final battle.</p> <p>Slowly, the Spider Monster became more and more exhausted, and the number of spiders swarming out decreased. The group finally saw a hope of victory!</p> <p>Over these few days, Goode, the Fox Elder, and the rest had taken turns to enter the fray, while the Heavenly Fox Yuna and Yang Ling sat quietly at the side to train.</p> <p>Ever since she evolved to take a human form, Yuna had made breakthroughs rapidly, both in terms of Magical Energy and mental energy. She now had enough of a resistance against the Dolphin Sonar Wizard Amulet, and her abilities were much more powerful than they used to be!</p> <p>Furthermore, through the research of the records left behind by her clansmen, her Petrifying Spell also improved by leaps and bounds. Originally, she had only been able to petrify a Bullman for a few minutes, but after two days of training, she was able to render a ferocious Bullman unable to move for a full hour.</p> <p>Yang Ling also gained much after silently training for two days.</p> <p>The Wizard Core in his body grew from the size of a grain of rice to the size of a peanut, officially stabilizing him at the level of Earth Wizard. He now had a massive amount of Wizard Power and mental energy. Previously, he would feel waves of piercing pain in his head when he heard the roar of the Spider Monster which carried with it a Soul Attack. Now, even though he would feel a little discomfort, the attack was not too much of an obstacle for him.</p> <p>With the improvements of his mental energy, he realized that the abilities of the mid-low level Magical Beasts such as the Horned Bee Beasts, Evil Eyes, and Tarantulas were all boosted significantly. In the past, even if they were outside the cave, they would experience chaotic thoughts, some even spitting blood and dying on the spot when they heard the roar of the Spider Monster. Now, even though they were inside the hall deep within the cave, they could last a few hours under the furious roars of the Spider Monster.</p> <p>After repeatedly confirming that the roars of the Spider Monster could no longer severely damage his own soul or those of his Magical Beast army, he was now even more confident about this attack. As long as he summoned his Magical Beast army at the critical time and launched a fierce offensive, Yang Ling believed that he would definitely be able to severely injure the Spider Monster with the army’s fierce attacks and impeccable coordination.</p> <p>As there were many Bullmen and Dogmen present, Yang Ling wasn’t willing, nor did he have the need to summon his Magical Beast army to aid in battle. There was no need for him to expose his trump card to exhaust the abilities of the Spider Monster.</p> <p>Compared to the Ogres, barbarians, and Elf archers, Yang Ling was more unwilling to let his Magical Beast army suffer heavy injuries or deaths. After all, no matter the circumstance, the Magical Beast army would definitely not betray him. The evolved Horned Bee Beasts, Evil Eyes, and Red-haired Tarantulas were the basis for his standing in this world.</p> <p>Three days passed in a flash. The group had finished their preparations before the full moon!</p> <p>To the Spider Monster whose abilities were deep beyond comprehension, the attacks of ordinary warriors were basically ineffective. Thus, under Yang Ling’s command, the group formed a true commando squad.</p> <p>The Ox Chief, Medusa leader, and Twin-headed Ogre Braska were responsible for close combat and attracting the attention of the Spider Army. The Fox Elder would lead a dozen of the most powerful warriors to protect Goode and Yuna, and these warriors were also responsible for long range attacks. Yang Ling would lie in ambush and look for an opportunity to deal a fatal blow.</p> <p>After the days of continuous battles, the cave was covered in blood, the corpses of spiders littered everywhere. In fact, they could even see the exposed Essence Crystals of the spiders. These low level Essence Crystals might be worthless to the Beastmen, but they were treasure to Yang Ling.</p> <p>After ordering Argus and his men to collect the Essence Crystals of the spiders and the blood that had not dried up, Yang Ling quickly followed the Fox Elder and the rest of his group. Today, he intentionally changed into a white shirt that blended into the white fog. Even though the Spider Monster had exhausted a large amount of its energy over the three days of battle, Yang Ling did not dare be careless.</p> <p>Through the memories of Yuna, Yang Ling knew a little about the Heavenly Fox that had battled the Spider Monster. That Heavenly Fox hadn’t been as powerful as a Sage level fighter, but it was definitely stronger than a Sword Saint or a Magical Tutor. In other words, the abilities of the Spider Monster back then were already far superior to an ordinary Sword Saint or Magical Tutor. After thousands of years, no one knew how far its abilities had grown!</p> <p>A moment’s carelessness might cause the army to be exterminated. They could not afford to be reckless!</p> <p>The hall deep within the cave was built with table-sized, rectangular blocks of stone, its interior black. The stones were strange, releasing a bone piercing chill. Even the Fox Elder, who was familiar with the historical records, had never seen stones like this, much less Yang Ling who had only arrived in this world not long ago.</p> <p>The hall was large. It looked like a monastery, or a so-called divine temple of this world. Looking from outside, Yang Ling felt that it was about the size of the lecture hall in his college, able to fit three to four thousand people.</p> <p>As there was a white fog in the air, they could not see the situation deep within the hall. No one knew where the Spider Monster was hiding. Out of caution, the group stood carefully at the entrance of the hall, no one daring to charge in recklessly.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Perhaps the Spider Monster it had exhausted a good portion of its energy, or perhaps it had understood the intention behind the rotational battle. Either way, the Spider Monster did not summon any more spiders to do battle despite its repeated roars. Its furious roaring reverberated around the hall, sometimes at the left and others at the right. No one could pinpoint its exact location at that instant.</p> <p>“Braska, if things don’t go as planned, make sure to retreat in time!”</p> <p>After instructing the rash Twin-headed Ogre, Yang Ling summoned his Unicorn to protect himself, then sat down cross-legged and slowly closed his eyes. Even though he had never seen this hall in his life, he for some reason had a sense of familiarity.</p> <p>That feeling was as if he had come back to a place that he had been to before, or returned to a place that he had lived in when he was young!</p> <p>Could this be a relic left behind by an Ancient Wizard?</p> <p>Thinking back to the Wizard Formation at the entrance of the cave, Yang Ling had a thought. He released a fine shred of mental energy, carefully investigating the secrets of this hall. According to what Yuna had said, the Spider Monster was unable to escape, but it still paid to be careful.</p> <p>He soon discovered a secret after his mental energy extended out following the side of the wall.</p> <p>Within the hall, both the ground and the walls were carved with mysterious symbols, releasing streaks of strange energy. It was different from spirit energy or life force. If this energy was breathed in, it would immediately seep through one’s muscles, its icy cold penetrating the bones!</p> <p>Out of curiosity, Yang Lng tried to inhale a few streaks of this strange energy, but he soon suffered for it! His muscles contracted greatly. In that instant, he felt as though his blood was about to freeze. He consumed a few Magical Beast Blood Orbs, and with some difficulty, he managed to dispel the chill that threatened to freeze even his brain matter.</p> <p>Even though he was almost frozen solid, it was not to say that there was no benefit!</p> <p>Calming down, Yang Ling noticed that the strange energy had caused his muscles and bones to become finer. His skin had also become finer and more sensitive. It was as if that ice cold energy had greatly strengthened his constitution.</p> <p>The white fog outside the hall was also very weird. The Beastmen did not feel discomfort when breathing it in, feeling that it was no different from air, while the Elf archers experienced a great benefit. After consuming it for a few days, they all had a considerable improvement in terms of vision and strength.</p> <p>The Ogres were a little worse off. After breathing in the white fog, they felt discomfort all over their bodies, and little blisters even formed on their skin. It was as if the white fog harbored an unknown energy that had varying effects to the different people who breathed it in, or even touched it.</p> <p>Breathing in a few mouthfuls of the white fog as a test, Yang Ling felt his body release streaks of chilly energy. The energy circulated around his body once before slowly being absorbed by the spinning Wizard Core. At the start, he felt that this white fog was similar to the white fog released by the Wizard’s Pagoda, but after close observation, he realized that there was a larger difference.</p> <p>The white fog within the Wizard’s Pagoda seemed to be able to encourage the evolution of the human body and Magical Beasts, and it could strengthen mental energy. But the white fog within the hall seemed to be able to boost the Wizard Power within the body. The effects of the two were direct opposites of each other.</p> <p>With the moon becoming rounder, the Magical Spell Formation outside the hall slowly released a large amount of white fog, slowly enveloping the entire hall.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Breathing in the ever present white fog, the Spider Monster deep within the hall let out loud roars. But different from the past, its voice had a little quiver, sometimes even letting out a few pathetic howls, as if it had been injured by the white fog.</p> <p>Slowly, as the white fog became thicker, the cries of the Spider Monster became longer and longer, more and more pathetic. It felt like pain straight into the bones, or a cry straight from the soul, as if it had received a fatal attack.</p> <p>Perhaps because of the struggles of the Spider Monster under immense pain, there were agitated sounds of collision coming from deep within the hall, sometimes to the right, and at others to the left. As there was a thick fog around them, no one could tell exactly where it was.</p> <p>But one thing was for sure! Just like the Heavenly Fox Yuna had said, the Spider Monster would be gravely injured and become drastically weaker when it inhaled a large amount of the white fog! Otherwise, it would definitely not let out such a painful, pathetic cry.</p> <p>The final battle was about to begin!</p>",
  "Chapter 137: Human-headed Spider Demon": "<p>The white fog billowed in the hall, limiting visibility. But with the Heavenly Fox Yuna’s guidance, the group was well prepared.</p> <p>After absorbing a large amount of sulfur, the Black Pulp Tree not only grew rapidly, it also bore Black Pulp Fruit that would explode upon contact. Its branches could be ignited quickly.</p> <p>After searching for many years, the Foxmen discovered a secret. A bowl-sized mud ball made from mud, sulfur, branches, and leaves from Black Pulp Trees could remain ignited for a full twelve hours. Despite releasing a vile stench, it was an ideal tool for illuminating a place, much better than the average flame torch.</p> <p>After understanding the situation within the hall, the Fox Elder arranged for his clansmen to make a few thousand mud balls. In the past, because they had not managed to find enough sulfur, the tribe had been unable to use a large amount of these practical mud balls. But as long as they managed to kill the Spider Monster and excavate the Taildon Valley sulfur mine on a large scale, they would have more than enough high quality sulfur.</p> <p>“On your marks, go!”</p> <p>With the Fox Elder’s command, the Dogmen tied the ignited mud balls onto their harpoons then tossed them out with strength.</p> <p>Molotov cocktails?</p> <p>Seeing the ignited mud balls, Yang Ling was somewhat surprised, not expecting the Beastmen to possess such an art. Originally, he had been frustrated that the white fog was obscuring their vision. He hadn’t expected the Fox Elder to solve the problem completely in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>In the eyes of an ordinary person, the mud balls were only a tool used for illumination, but Yang Ling had quickly thought of many other applications for them.</p> <p>After making the exquisite mud balls, he could use them as lights, turning Wissen Town into a nightless city. He could form teams of merchants to sell these to bustling human cities, guaranteeing him a profit and bringing him an endless stream of income.</p> <p>After recruiting expert artisans, he could also remodel these mud balls into Molotov cocktails. He believed that these would definitely be a nightmare for his enemies, be it on offense or defense. Coupled with the powerful Black Pulp Melon, he could even make them into exploding grenades, which would have destructive capabilities far beyond anyone’s imagination.</p> <p>Yang Ling had many thoughts, while the Dogmen kept themselves busy throwing out waves of harpoons. Soon, the hall was covered with burning mud balls.</p> <p>Every burning mud ball illuminated the ten step area around it. After the Dogmen threw out a few waves of harpoons, other than a few limited corners, everything within the hall could be seen clearly. Soon, the group noticed the Spider Monster’s position and true appearance.</p> <p>Under the fiery red flame, Yang Ling saw a ferocious, massive creature scrunched deep within the hall.</p> <p>It had eight legs, each the thickness of a barrel, large and powerful. Each leg was split into eight sections, each section thicker than the last and covered with thumb-sized black hair. At the end of every leg were claws about five and a half inches long, gleaming with cold light.</p> <p>The Spider Monster’s body was massive. According to preliminary observation, it was about the size of a heavy truck, its body covered with dense scales. Its spine protruded out of its body, looking like the backbone of a huge fish from far away, or a giant sharp sword.</p> <p>What scared the group was that the Spider Monster had the enlarged head of a human. Its head was no different from a human’s save for its few exposed fangs. From far away, if one did not see its lower body, they would think that it was a giant crouching on the ground!</p> <p>Looking at the ferocious, strange Spider Monster, the group felt their scalps turn numb as they lost their color in shock. Yang Ling was no exception, subconsciously taking a few gasps of air.</p> <p>Just what is this monster?</p> <p>After swallowing hard, Yang Ling quickly took out the sharp dagger from his Space Ring, then took in a deep breath, trying his best to calm himself down.</p> <p>Shocking, this is too shocking!</p> <p>Even though they had prepared themselves beforehand, no one could have expected the Spider Monster to look like this. On the Tailun Continent, there were Orcs with the heads of bulls, Medusas who had human torsos and snake tails, but no one had seen a monster with a human head and the body of a spider. Thinking for some time, the Fox Elder was convinced that there was no such monster in the historical records.</p> <p>“Oh, a Human-form Heavenly Fox? I was wondering why there was a familiar ripple two days ago. To think that a small fox has managed to evolve to gain a human form, hehe!” Smiling coldly, the Spider Monster looked at the Heavenly Fox Yuna with greed. “I have not tasted a Human-form Heavenly Fox in so long. I used to be called Abbas then. A hundred years, or five hundred years? Hehe, you came just in time to fill my stomach.”</p> <p>A Spider Monster that can speak?</p> <p>Looking at the strange Spider Monster, hearing its piercing, raspy voice, the group was shocked once again. A monster with the head of a human and the body of a spider had already chilled their hearts, but they did not expect this monster to be able to speak!</p> <p>After taking in a few deep breaths, the group no longer hesitated, deciding to take action at once. The Ox Chief lifted his giant battle halberd and took the lead, while the Twin-headed Ogre Braska and Medusa leader followed closely behind him. At the end were the Spellcasters like the Fox Elder, Goode, and Heavenly Fox Yuna, protected by the warriors.</p> <p>“Hehe, you are simply asking for death!”</p> <p>Letting out a cold smile, the Spider Monster that called itself Abbas pounced forward, arriving before the Ox Chief in the blink of an eye. It then sent its claw crashing down.</p> <p>He was too fast!</p> <p>No one expected the massive Spider Monster to be so incredibly quick, and the Ox Chief was no exception. He instinctively jumped to the side. Even though he narrowly managed to avoid the crisis, his body became covered in cold sweat due to the shock.</p> <p>Seeing the black figure pursue him like a shadow, he swung his giant battle halberd. It seemed to hit a sturdy metal, completely incapable of damaging the other party’s sharp, hard claws.</p> <p>Missing his first attack, the Spider Monster was fast as lightning, and once again launched a fierce attack. With a few flicks, it successively tore the sturdy hide on the Ox Chief’s body into pieces, bringing with it a few streaks of blood.</p> <p>After a dull thud, the Ox Chief turned pale, rolling away as he pressed on his wounds, narrowly avoiding the crisis. Then, just as he was about to climb up, he took a hurried look behind him, only to realize that the Spider Monster had closed in on him, its fangs bared!</p> <p>“Ah…”</p> <p>Seeing the Ox Chief unable to dodge in time, the group standing inside the hall shouted out. A few fierce Bullmen charged forward without consideration, hoping that they could save their chief. They wanted so desperately to grow two more legs. Unfortunately, they were at least a full hundred steps away from the battle and would be unable to rush over even if they grew wings!</p> <p>At the critical moment, the Twin-headed Ogre Braska arrived in time!</p> <p>Letting out a roar, the Twin-headed Ogre slipped into a Bloodthirsty Frenzy, the muscles on his body towering high, filled with an explosive power. It crashed down with its club, the impact landing on the body of the Spider Monster with a thud.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Suffering the brunt of the attack, the Spider Monster that was preparing to kill the Ox Chief was furious. It took a sharp turn backward, opening its mouth to spew out a scorching black flame. Even though the Twin-headed Ogre managed to avoid the attack in time, his eyebrows were incinerated in an instant. He nearly became a pile of charcoal.</p> <p>“Oh god, Heavenly Purple Flames, that is a high level fire element monster. Quick, quick stop it!”</p> <p>Seeing the Spider Monster spew out purple flames, the Fox Elder lost his color in shock. He raised his hands and released an icicle, preventing it from continuing its attack on the Twin-headed Ogre who was still recovering from his shock.</p> <p>Seeing the dire situation, the group all took action!</p> <p>The Medusa leader flailed her tail, quickly moving to the Spider Monster’s back and slicing four times at the same spot of the monster’s rearmost right leg, bringing with her attacks a rain of blood. In that instant, the snake venom on the blades seeped into the monster’s body through the wound.</p> <p>After her successful attack, the Medusa leader flailed her tail and retreated several meters, her movements quick. She moved continuously, sometimes to the left and sometimes to the right, searching for a suitable opportunity. The Spider Monster’s abilities were deep, beyond comprehension. Perhaps the snake poison that was fatal to an average person might not have too much of an effect on it. They had to find a way to directly deal heavy damage to its body.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>In its intense pain, the Spider Monster broke into a fury. But just as it was about to pounce forward and tear the Medusa leader to pieces, the Heavenly Fox Yuna finally took action, releasing the Petrifying Spell that she had been preparing for a long time.</p> <p>Caught off guard, the Spider Monster was rendered unable to move, just like a stone statue. Even though its mouth was opened wide, it was unable to release the Heavenly Purple Flame that was in its mouth. The flame sizzled within its maw.</p> <p>Seeing the Spider Monster unable to move, Yang Ling, who had been sitting cross legged on the ground, finally found a suitable opportunity. He formed a hand gesture and teleported to its side using his Earth Evasion. Thrusting forward with his dagger infused with Wizard Power, he stabbed the Spider Monster in the ribs, plunging the dagger all the way in until only the handle was left visible.</p> <p>At the same time, the rest of the group took action!</p> <p>The Medusas reacted the fastest, pouncing forward, once again slicing the rearmost right leg of the Spider Monster four times, each attack further exposing the flesh. The Twin-headed Ogre let out a violent roar, bring his club down directly on the head of the Spider Monster. Even the injured Ox Chief was unwilling to pass up on this opportunity, bringing his halberd fiercely down on the neck of the Spider Monster!</p> <p>“Quick, retreat quickly!”</p> <p>Originally, Yang Ling was prepared to stab the Spider Monster another time at its heart, but seeing a cold gleam in the other party’s eyes, he knew that the effects of the Petrifying Spell were beginning to vanish. In his shock, he quickly gave the order to retreat. He teleported to the hall’s entrance where the white fog billowed.</p> <p>With Yang Ling’s order, the group did not dare extend the battle, and retreated quickly. Seeing the Ox Chief still bleeding freely, running away slowly while pressing on his wounds, the Twin-headed Ogre Braska lifted him up, clenching his teeth as he ran.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Licking the fresh blood on its body, the Spider Monster was furious, letting out enraged roars. It pounced forward upon a nervous, slower Bullman who had been looking around in fear as he was running, and tore the Bullman in two. It then chewed ferociously, swallowing him in front of the group.</p> <p>“All of you, you can all die!”</p> <p>The Spider Monster spat out the Bullman’s hair, licked its lips, and charged forward once again. It made its way around the slower Bullmen and aimed straight for the Twin-headed Ogre Braska who was running and carrying the Ox Chief.</p> <p>The Spider Monster is just too fast!</p> <p>In the eyes of an ordinary person, all they could see was a string of afterimages. They felt as though the Spider Monster had arrived behind the Twin-headed Ogre right after it had finished its sentence. It seemed even faster than the teleportation of a Spellcaster!</p>",
  "Chapter 138: Summoner of Beast Blood": "<p>The Spider Monster extended its claws as it pounced toward the retreating Twin-headed Ogre and Ox Chief. All who saw lost their voices in shock. No one, not the Medusa leader or the Fox Elder or the Heavenly Fox Yuna were able to rush to their aid in time.</p> <p>At the critical moment, Yang Ling, who had been sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, teleported into battle once again!</p> <p>After locking in on the Spider Monster with his mental energy, Yang Ling could sense its every action clearly even though his eyes remained closed. He attacked once again, knowing the dangerous situation the Twin-headed Ogre and Ox Chief were in.</p> <p>After licking the flesh and blood from its mouth, the Spider Monster let out a cruel laugh. But just as it was prepared to tear the Twin-headed Ogre and Ox Chief to pieces, a ripple suddenly appeared in the air on its left. It instinctively felt an intense sense of danger.</p> <p>In its unease, the Spider Monster had no choice but to give up on the prey before its eyes. It dodged to the right, narrowly avoiding Yang Ling’s sharp dagger.</p> <p>Yang Ling retreated, teleporting back to the fog-covered entrance of the hall with blinding speed. It was enough that he saved the Twin-headed Ogre and Ox Chief for now. It was still not the time to go all out against the Spider Monster.</p> <p>After being forced to retreat by Yang Ling, the Spider Monster cautiously stopped in its tracks. Seeing Yang Ling teleport to the entrance of the hall in the blink of an eye, keenly observing the ripples of Wizard Power in his body, its agitation increased.</p> <p>“Hehe, five thousand years I’ve waited, until another Ancient Wizard has finally appeared, hehe!” the Spider Monster said, eyeing Yang Ling in excitement. It slowly advanced, one step at a time, its eyes blood red.</p> <p>It could feel a wave of unique energy ripples within Yang Ling. That obscure, mysterious feeling was similar to the characteristics of the fabled Ancient Wizard. If it gained the secrets of the Ancient Summoner, it might be able to escape from its restraints. It might also free itself from this half-human, half-spider state!</p> <p>Abbas, five thousand years ago, powerful summoning abilities…</p> <p>The seemingly casual remark sounded significant to the Fox Elder. Pondering the ferocious Spider Monster, the Fox Elder suddenly recalled an ancient legend.</p> <p>Five thousand years ago, when the Ancient Summoners had already been gone for more than a thousand years, a powerful Summoner by the name of Abbas had appeared amongst the humans. He could summon vast numbers of Magical Beasts to do battle, and he became a renowned expert under the Church. Even though he was not a Sage-level fighter, his abilities were far superior to a Sword Saint or Holy Magical Tutor in a large scale battle.</p> <p>That period of time was when the Beastmen were suffering from the heaviest oppression. Many of the Beastmen had been massacred by the Church in the name of cult extermination. Among them, Abbas had the highest number of kills, leading his Magical Beast army and massacring many Beastmen tribes. He was called the Summoner of Beast Blood. Basically, almost all of the Beastmen tribes that luckily survived had his notorious name in their tribal records.</p> <p>Could this Spider Monster that could speak human words have some connection with the Summoner of Beast Blood from five thousand years ago?</p> <p>Looking at the ferocious Spider Monster, the Fox Elder became more suspicious of his own thoughts. He muttered, “Could it be that you are the Summoner of Beast Blood Abbas from five thousand years ago?”</p> <p>Summoner of Beast Blood?</p> <p>Hearing the Fox Elder say this, the Spider Monster paused, then let out a loud maniacal laugh. “Five thousand years have passed! To think that there is still someone that remembers the name of Abbas, the Summoner of Beast Blood, hehe!”</p> <p>The Spider Monster laughed harshly, recalling many events of its past.</p> <p>Back then, he was ordered to lead an army to attack a Beastman tribe. Unexpectedly, he fell for an ambush set up by high level Orc warriors and Orc Soul Priests. He had carelessly allowed the Chuch to use him as bait for the Sage-level Orc King. In his carelessness, he had been sent by the Church to act as bait, attracting to him the sage level Orc King.</p> <p>After the fierce battle, even though he was lucky enough to escape, he became inflicted with the vicious curse of the Orc Soul Priests and slowly became a half human half spider Spider Monster. When he traveled with difficulty back to the Church, hoping that he would be able to obtain the Pope’s help, he instead invited the so-called purification persecution from the Church.</p> <p>Having been renounced and under the pursuit of the Church’s experts, he had no choice but to flee.</p> <p>A few years prior, he had seen a Church historical record. It was said that there were once powerful Ancient Wizards on the Tailun Continent. They split into two factions after the Great Battle of the Gods and Demons, becoming the Ancient Summoners and Tree Shepherds that had appeared for a short span of time.</p> <p>It was rumored that the Ancient Wizards could communicate with and control the souls of the living things in this world. Other than the Pope, perhaps only they could help him recover his original body. Thus, he looked all over the world for traces of the Ancient Wizards. But not only did he roam for many years looking for one, he eventually became trapped in the hall for thousands of years.</p> <p>The Spider Monster was momentarily dazed, recalling the events of the past. Yang Ling, who had been secretly observing him, finally found another chance to attack. But this time, the ones who attacked were the Dogmen warriors that had been engaged in preparations for a long time.</p> <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p> <p>Under Yang Ling’s command, the ferocious Dogmen threw the poison-laced harpoons. The harpoons landed like rain on the body of the dazed Spider Monster. The clanging of metal colliding with metal rang out. Even though most of the harpoons were deflected by the tight array of scales on the monster’s body, several of them plunged deep into its soft stomach.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Yanking the harpoons from its body, the Spider Monster Abbas was furious. It roared as it advanced without consideration, wanting to swallow Yang Ling whole. As long as it consumed his memories, it might be able to directly obtain the secrets of the Ancient Wizard and escape this imprisonment. It might also be able to change its mutated body.</p> <p>Fifty steps, forty steps, thirty steps…</p> <p>The closer to the entrance of the hall, the thicker the white fog, and the more damage it inflicted on the Spider Monster. Soon, under the corrosion of the white fog, its body became covered with thumb-sized pus-filled blisters, rapidly expanding. When the blisters exploded, they released bright red pools of blood. Then another blister would form on the wound, which would explode once again… The cycle repeated over and over again!</p> <p>Despite suffering heavy injuries, the Spider Monster darted forward in its frenzy, approaching the group!</p> <p>Seeing the Spider Monster charge forward, bearing with the damage it took from the white fog, Yang Ling sprang into action. He waved his hand and the barbarians, armed with heavy crossbows, immediately stepped forward. In that instant, the heavy crossbows that could pierce even the black armor of the Banto soldiers rained on the Spider Monster’s body. For added effect, each of the arrows was smothered with the fatal snake poison.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Even though many of the heavy arrows were deflected by the tightly knit scales, the Spider Monster still got hit from time to time at such a close distance. Slowly, the snake poison accumulated in its body. Its reactions gradually slowed. The white fog’s effects contributed too, slowing the monster increasingly.</p> <p>“Go, restrain it, don’t let it retreat!” Yang Ling ordered calmly, as he saw the Spider Monster begin to contemplate its escape.</p> <p>Letting out a savage roar, the Twin-headed Ogre Braska slipped into a Bloodthirsty Frenzy, charging out and attacking the Spider Monster as it tried to retreat. The Medusa leader also did not dare be tardy, flailing her tail and darting toward the monster with four curved blades in hand.</p> <p>The Ox Chief was feeling better after Goode treated and bandaged his injuries. Seeing the dire situation the Spider Monster was in, he also clenched his teeth and charged forward.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Fox Elder led a few of his clansmen and launched a rising wall of fire, completely blocking the Spider Monster’s path of retreat.</p> <p>Under the effects of the Twin-headed Ogre’s Bloodthirsty Ring of Light, the Ox Chief and Medusa leader also quickly slipped into a frenzy, their speed and power increasing manyfold.</p> <p>Under the effects of the Ox Chief’s Endurance Ring of Light, a ring of green light appeared not only around the feet of the Twin-headed Ogre and Medusa leader, but also around the Fox Elder, Goode, and the rest. Their Magical Energy pulsed, their stamina rich, as if their entire bodies were filled with energy.</p> <p>Just like that, the group worked together with one another, their coordination improving as they fought!</p> <p>When the Spider Monster surged forward, the group retreated quickly, hiding in the foggy entrance of the hall; when the Spider Monster attempted to retreat, Spellcasters like Goode and the Fox Elder launched bolts of rising walls of fire, blocking its retreat completely, while others seized the opportunity to launch a relentless pursuit.</p> <p>The Twin-headed Ogre’s heavy attacks, the impact wave and War Trample of the Ox Chief, the Medusa leader’s successive attacks, and the wall of fire and icicles conjured by the Fox Elder and Goode…</p> <p>The Spider Monster, whose abilities were decreased by the corrosive white fog, could not withstand the attacks. Even though its scales were hard and sturdy, it was unable to deflect the heavy crossbows and sharp harpoons at such a close distance. The Spider Monster had to be extremely cautious of the Heavenly Fox’s Petrifying Spell and Yang Ling’s sneaky surprise attacks, and it was unable to charge out of the embattlement no matter how strong its defense was. It was trapped in the small area where the white fog billowed.</p> <p>Under the combined attacks of the group and the corrosion of the white fog, the Spider Monster soon became bloodied and covered in wounds. With the accumulation of the snake poison in its body, its reactions became increasingly slower, giving the Twin-headed Ogre and Medusas more chances to land their attacks.</p> <p>The Heavenly Fox Yuna suppressed her urge to take action immediately, searching calculatedly for an opportunity to deal a fatal blow to the Spider Monster at the critical moment. To an ordinary person, her Magical Illusory Spell Formation was mysterious and powerful, but against the Spider Monster, who had immense mental energy, she might not be strong enough. Thus, she had to be patient and search for a suitable opportunity.</p> <p>The Heavenly Fox Yuna waited for an opportunity, and so did Yang Ling!</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged on the ground, he had his mental energy locked onto the surrounded Spider Monster, and he was searching for its weakness carefully. A warrior or Magical Beast would have a weakness no matter how powerful they were. He believed that the Spider Monster would not be able to escape his fatal blow when its stamina, Magical Energy, and mental energy had decreased to a certain degree. Then, its defense would be open, and its reactions would be dull.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>Having been cut successively by the Medusa leader, almost slicing open its heel, the Spider Monster became furious, slipping into complete hysteria. It spat out an obscure incantation, summoning a horde of ferocious Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders.</p> <p>“Haha, die, die all of you!”</p> <p>In its fury, the Spider Monster paid no regard to the attacks behind it and roared as it sprang forward, grabbing the Medusa leader who had been unable to retreat in time. It inflicted a few deep and long wounds on her body, then opened its mouth, ready to release a scorching hot Heavenly Purple Fire!</p>",
  "Chapter 139: Devoured": "<p> </p> <p>The temperature of the Spider Monster’s Purple Heavenly Fire was extremely high. Even the rocks would burn when touched by the flames. The Twin-headed Ogre had accidentally brushed past the Heavenly Fire, and had his moustache, eyebrows, and hair almost completely burned off by a stray ember. Now that the Medusa leader was pinned down by the Spider Monster, what would happen to her if she suffered the full brunt of the Heavenly Fire attack?</p> <p>In that instant, seeing the heavily injured Medusa leader, then looking at the ferocious Spider Monster and the faint flicker of the Purple Heavenly Fire, the group lost their color in shock. Some gave their best effort and threw out their harpoons; some raised the heavy crossbows and fired a few rounds, but unfortunately the countless Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders blocked the attacks for the Spider Monster, swarming around it.</p> <p>No one believed they would be able to save the Medusa leader, and they all closed their eyes to avoid the ghastly scene. At that moment, the Heavenly Fox Yuna and Yang Ling took action once again!</p> <p>A silver glint flashed past, and the Spider Monster once again was paralyzed by the Heavenly Fox Yuna’s Petrifying Spell, unable to release the Purple Heavenly Fire brewing in its mouth. Yang Ling teleported right in front of the creature without a trace, and stabbed his dagger down toward its head. Then he picked up the Medusa leader and retreated.</p> <p>An opportunity like this does not come twice!</p> <p>Seeing the Spider Monster paralyzed once again, the group did not waste their chance.</p> <p>The barbarians and Dogmen who had gotten into formation gave their best in their attacks, their poison coated harpoons and catapults raining down onto the Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders, clearing off a large area of them in one go!</p> <p>Under the command of the Gnome Elder, the Gnome Spellcasters joined hands and cast a shield barrier, protecting the group from the poisonous attacks of the Giant Crab Spider. The Spellcasters, including Goode and the Fox Elder, released walls of raging fire, incinerating the spider horde!</p> <p>The Twin-headed Ogre Braska roared and smashed down on the Spider Monster’s head before retreating quickly, narrowly avoiding the Giant Crab Spiders. The Ox Chief let out a powerful impact wave, slicing the Spider Monster in its soft belly like a sharp blade, inflicting a wound a meter long…</p> <p>In that instant, even the Spider Monster suffered from the heavy attacks, its body covered in blood, its intestines oozing out. The ordinary Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders fared worse. Of all of its injuries, the head injury inflicted by Yang Ling’s blade was the most serious. Fresh blood flowed everywhere. In fact, even its white brain matter was seeping out of the wound!</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>In its intense pain, the Spider Monster trembled and recovered its ability to move. Its furious roars reverberated around the hall, each roar louder than the last. The roars attacked the souls of group directly like a tide!</p> <p>The people trembled, feeling as if their brains had been hit by hammers. Some felt dizzy, their vision blurred; some had difficulty breathing, as if they were suffocating, a formless hand tightly clasped around their necks; some even bled from the mouth, slumping to the ground.</p> <p>Yang Ling felt that something was off the moment the Spider Monster lifted its head. He covered his ears and tried his best to circulate the protective Wizard Power in his body. Even so, he still felt his blood churn in his body and a buzz in his head, as if he had smashed his head into a brick wall. Luckily, he had advanced to the level of Earth Wizard in time, and his mental energy had greatly improved. Otherwise, one of those soundwaves would have been enough to turn him into an idiot.</p> <p>The greater the mental energy, the more sensitive one was to a Soul Attack, and the Heavenly Fox Yuna was no exception. Even though she had tried her best to defend herself against the howls of the Spider Monster, she still bled from her mouth, her mental energy and Magical Energy exhausted.</p> <p>The group suffered from the heavy impact, but the Spider Monster was not too well off either!</p> <p>Under the white fog’s corrosion, its mental energy and Magical Energy had decreased drastically. Summoning the huge wave of Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders had further depleted a third of its remaining energies.</p> <p>The Soul Attacks the Spider Monster released with its deafening howls continued to deplete its remaining mental energy, rendering it yet more susceptible to the surrounding fog. Blisters grew continuously all over its body, exploding and then regrowing, then exploding… It was losing its Blood Essence in waves!</p> <p>The lower its mental energy, the more susceptible it was to the white fog. In the blink of an eye, the Spider Monster had become covered in fresh blood. Under the corrosion of the white fog, its white bones were even exposed in some parts of its body, making it look exceptionally fearsome!</p> <p>“Hehehe, die, die!”</p> <p>Perhaps it was unleashing its bestial qualities, or perhaps it had now lost its mind after being stabbed in the head by Yang Ling. This time, the heavily injured Spider Monster did not bother retreating. Instead, it chose to advance, darting forward with a roar in an attempt to finish off the group in one fell swoop.</p> <p>Skitter, skitter, skitter…</p> <p>Under the command of the Spider Monster, the Giant Crab Spiders launched their poisonous attacks, even in the face of the raging flames and arrows raining down all around them, totally unafraid of death. They attacked the gnome Spellcasters’ protective barrier, tearing apart the Beastmen that had not made it into the barrier in time.</p> <p>If the Giant Crab Spiders were a high pressured water gun, then the Twin-headed Horse Spiders were like bulldozers! Under the Spider Monster’s command, they rabidly crashed into the protective barrier in front of them, as if a bull was battering it down!</p> <p>The protective barrier creaked incessantly under the attacks of the Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders, as if it were going to crumble at any moment. But under the effortful counterattack of the group, the spiders also paid a heavy price, their numbers dropping steadily as they fell one wave after the next.</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>The Spider Monster disregarded the group’s harpoons and catapults, charging fiercely, and it rammed into the protective barrier, once, twice… It unleashed all the power it had in its body. The protective barrier shook. Even the ground trembled.</p> <p>Facing the crazed Spider Monster, Yang Ling was silent, quietly waiting for the final killing blow. Even though the Spider Monster looked extremely ferocious, it was in reality on its last leg. It might not be able to hold its own under the thick white fog for too much longer, even if Yang Ling did not attack it himself!</p> <p>Soon after, the protective barrier scattered under the Spider Monster’s heavy attacks. But, without waiting for it to charge over, Yang Ling appeared in front of it, fast as lightning.</p> <p>“Hehehe, die!”</p> <p>Just as Yang Ling was about to use an attack he had used before, the Spider Monster, who had adopted a charging posture, suddenly opened its mouth and bit down onto Yang Ling’s left shoulder, and lifted him off the ground. It then retreated, fast as the wind. The rest of the Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders defended its back, blocking the Twin-headed Ogre and Goode who were prepared to reinforce Yang Ling.</p> <p>The Spider Monster was gleeful after having successfully bitten Yang Ling. If it devoured Yang Ling’s memories, it would be able to directly obtain the secrets of the Ancient Wizard. It believed its intuition. Even if Yang Ling was not a true Ancient Wizard, he would definitely contain the training method of an Ancient Wizard; otherwise, there was no way that his body would contain that mysterious ripple. In order to obtain the secrets of the Ancient Wizard, it was willing to pay any price!</p> <p>I fell into a trap?</p> <p>Yang Ling watched the Spider Monster retreating rapidly, its bloodthirsty red eyes rolling. He swallowed with difficulty. The Spider Monster had immense strength, and Yang Ling could not free himself in that instant no matter what he tried! Seeing the other party’s sharp teeth and large, exposed throat, Yang Ling came up with an idea that made use of his circumstances.</p> <p>After retreating back to a corner where the white fog was thinner, the Spider Monster did not hesitate any longer. It was prepared to tear Yang Ling in two and then swallow him. Since it had become this half human half monster Spider Monster thanks to the curse of the Orc Soul Priests, it had gradually gained a few strange abilities. One of those included swallowing the memories of its prey.</p> <p>Opening its mouth wide, the Spider Monster prepared to tear Yang Ling in two. Instead, it felt a pain in its chin, exactly where Yang Ling’s dagger had just found purchase. Yang Ling kicked, and the Monster found itself swallowing Yang Ling whole!</p> <p>The Spider Monster was about the size of a truck, the insides of its body filled with red organs and fresh blood. Of course, it also had a considerable amount of coursing digestive fluids. Scanning his surroundings, Yang Ling could see limbs that had not yet been digested completely. There were the claws of Giant Crab Spiders, the limbs of the Twin-headed Horse Spiders… It was incredibly disgusting.</p> <p>Yang Ling tried his best to pulse the Wizard Power in his body, his body releasing a dull red glow to protect himself against the digestive fluids in the Spider Monster’s belly. Grounding himself, he summoned his army of Horned Bee Beasts, instructing them to tear the place apart as they wished!</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beast horde stung the Spider Monster’s organs, ripping into its body with wild abandon. They tore open its digestive tract, wrenched open its stomach, swallowed its heart…</p> <p>Roar…</p> <p>The Spider Monster rolled around in intense pain, slamming itself into walls like a headless fly in an attempt to squeeze Yang Ling and the Horned Bee Beasts out. Unfortunately, it was all for naught!</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts continued their attacks, and the Spider Monster trembled in pain. It felt like a million ants were devouring its soul. Every inch of its skin and every single one of its nerves radiated with waves of intense pain. Every muscle in its body convulsed uncontrollably!</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts caused such intense pain, as they tore the Spider Monster’s insides apart, but the Spider Monster only experienced life and death pain when Yang Ling summoned the spider army!</p> <p>The Horned Bee Beasts tore apart a piece of flesh at a time, each mouthful like a needle sting. But the Tarantulas took a bite at the flesh, then pulled on it, then took another bite for extra measure!</p> <p>With the Horned Bee Beasts and spider army tearing it apart, the powerful Spider Monster collapsed soon after. It broke down completely!</p> <p>No one could tolerate that intense pain. Even a mutated spider could not bear the cruel torture of being sliced apart by a million blades all at once.</p> <p>In just an hour, the Summoner of Beast Blood Abbas, that had been unthinkably powerful a few thousand years ago, the Abbas that had once massacred cities across tens of thousand of miles, the expert from the Church whose name would bring fear to all enemies, laid motionless on the ground, completely dead.</p> <p>After killing off the remaining Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders, and looking on the Spider Monster that had died brutally, they thought back to Yang Ling who had sacrificed himself, and the group cried. The forest elves that had rushed over after receiving the news had tears covering their faces, kneeling on the ground helplessly.</p> <p>Without Yang Ling’s help in the past, their tribe would have long ago been felled by Ymir. Without Yang Ling’s generosity, their tribe would have no way of surviving the slow, harsh winter. The elves did not know how to break this cruel news to Sofia when she returned from the altar of the Goddess of Nature.</p> <p>Reeling helplessly, the Heavenly Fox Yuna slumped to the ground. But just as she began to cry, she began to feel a familiar, friendly ripple come from inside the Spider Monster’s still, broken body!</p>",
  "Chapter 140: A Different Wizard Mantra": "<p>Could it be that Master…</p> <p>The Heavenly Fox Yuna, steeped in doubt, suddenly realized something. She ran toward the Spider Monster’s corpse without consideration for her own safety. Behind her, the Twin-headed Ogre also seemed to have sensed something, and he followed close behind her.</p> <p>Rustle, rustle…</p> <p>As the group watched, confused, the Spider Monster’s body trembled gently, giving off waves of a strange sound. It sounded a little like Giant Crab Spiders spitting venom, or some wild beast tearing meat from its prey. Below the billowing white fog, in the palace covered in blood and corpses, the sounds were exceptionally frightening.</p> <p>“Be careful!”</p> <p>The Fox Elder, wearing a grave expression, called out to the Heavenly Fox Yuna and the Twin-headed Ogre, hoping to stop them from running to the Spider Monster’s brutalized corpse. It was rumored that the Summoner of Beast Blood Abbas was the incarnation of an evil demon and had several strange abilities. No one could guarantee that no accidents would occur if one carelessly approached its body.</p> <p>“Elder, Master is still alive! Let us get over there!” exclaimed the Heavenly Fox Yuna to the Fox Elder who stood in her path. Her excitement grew as she felt the familiar ripple strengthen. She was more certain than ever that Yang Ling was alive. She wanted desperately to slice open the Spider Monster’s corpse and release Yang Ling.</p> <p>While the Heavenly Fox Yuna explained to the Fox Elder, the Twin-headed Ogre opted to push through the Dogmen blocking his path and stride toward the corpse. Compared to Yuna, who had an exceptional mental energy, he did not feel any familiar ripples. But his instincts said that Yang Ling was still alive.</p> <p>“I’ll tear anyone who blocks my path in two!” yelled the Twin-headed Ogre, noticing both Dogmen and Bullmen gearing up to stop him.</p> <p>Bellowing, he once again slipped into a Bloodthirsty Frenzy despite the possibility of him being consumed by it. It was only safe for him to enter the frenzy three times in a day, or there was a high risk that the spell might consume him. But he had decided to risk it all to save Yang Ling. Brandishing his club, he would smash anyone who dared to try to stop him.</p> <p>Observing the Twin-headed Ogre become frenzied again, and observing the giant club in his hands, both the Dogmen and Bullmen paused. No one dared step forward to stop him.</p> <p>The Spider Monster’s corpse was trembling even harder, as if every muscle in its body was shivering. At the same time, the strange sound was getting louder and more clear, as if some monster was about to emerge from the corpse!</p> <p>“Get into formation, quick!”</p> <p>The Fox Elder shook his head, frustrated. He ordered the rest of the people to prepare for a monster to emerge from the Spider Monster’s corpse, not knowing what to expect.</p> <p>Rustle, rustle…</p> <p>Just as the Beastmen were nocking their arrows, on high alert, a sharp black horn emerged. Following that, a fist-sized Horned Bee Beast covered in blood emerged from the body.</p> <p>Rustle, rustle…</p> <p>With the sound getting clearer and clearer, multiple small holes bloomed all over the Spider Monster’s corpse. A bloodied Horned Bee Beast emerged from each hole. The small holes widened bit by bit, tearing apart as Tarantulas followed the Horned Bee Beasts, baring their fangs. Each and every one of them was covered in blood!</p> <p>Yang Ling emerged from the bloodied corpse with dagger in hand after the calf-sized Tarantula King dug its way out. No one could be sure if Yang Ling was injured, or if all of the gore that covered him belonged to the vanquished foe.</p> <p>“Oh Yiblis, I didn’t get bitten to death, but I nearly suffocated!” Taking a deep breath of air, Yang Ling sat down on the ground.</p> <p>After summoning his Horned Bee Beasts and spiders, he had grabbed his dagger and charged around inside the Spider Monster’s body, protected by his Wizard Power. He stabbed, sliced, hacked and cut, using every technique that he knew.</p> <p>Other than causing destruction, he found and dug out the Spider Monster’s Essence Core. The Spider Monster was very powerful, far more powerful than the Nine-headed Snake Monster Yang Ling had fought before. It was probably a high-level stage nine Magical Beast. If not for the white fog exhausting many of its abilities, his group would not have had any chance of obtaining victory.</p> <p>In addition to its Essence Crystal, Yang Ling had also found several strange items within the Spider Monster. There was a steel box about the size of a cell phone, a badge carved with images of various Magical Beasts, a shiny Space Ring… in fact, there was even a mottled magical staff. It looked like the Spider Monster had once consumed a number of intelligent life forms, devouring the treasures they carried.</p> <p>“Sir, are you alright?” Goode walked over quickly, recovering from his shock.</p> <p>Goode had felt as though his heart had been sliced to pieces by a blade after the Spider Monster swallowed Yang Ling, blaming himself for being unable to save him in time. He had unleashed his fury on the Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders. He never expected that Yang Ling would survive being consumed, and that he would use the opportunity to finish off the powerful Spider Monster from within.</p> <p>“Hehe, the weather is cold and I have not had a shower for some time now. I accidentally stank the Spider Monster to death. It is my fault, my fault!” Yang Ling said as he took off his bloodstained outer jacket. He then took a clean jacket out from the Space Ring and continued, “Goode, order Argus to lead a team here to clean out the battlefield, the sooner the better. There’s nothing but treasures here!”</p> <p>There’s nothing but treasures here?</p> <p>The Fox Elder was confused. He watched Yang Ling collecting the Spider Monster’s corpse. Around them were the scattered corpses of Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders. He could not see anything that looked like treasure. He did acknowledge to himself that it was a great treasure by itself to have vanquished the terrifying Spider Monster with such few casualties.</p> <p>Killing the Spider Monster meant that he no longer had to worry about his tribe being attacked by spider armies. Killing the Spider Monster not only avenged the Heavenly Fox race; it also meant that they could successfully conduct a large scale development on the sulfur mine in the valley and from there, accelerate the growth of their Black Pulp Trees.</p> <p>The sulfur mine in the Taildon Valley was massive and easy to excavate. Even though they only had twenty percent of whatever they excavated, it was more than enough for the Beastmen! They only needed the sulfur to cultivate the Black Pulp Trees and make a few mud balls for illumination. They did not need to earn a large amount of crystal coins like Yang Ling.</p> <p>To the aborigines scattered around the Ladak Mountain Range, the most precious item was not crystal coins, but rations, weapons, and armor, and the Beastmen were no exception.</p> <p>Goode left quickly after receiving his order. The Fox Elder did not understand Yang Ling’s intentions, but he knew that the corpses of the Giant Crab Spiders and Twin-headed Horse Spiders, and even their fresh blood, had various uses. While he was with Yang Ling, Goode began to understand the other man. He was clear in his heart, even if he did not speak of it.</p> <p>After circling the hall and realizing that there were no obvious treasures, Yang Ling sat cross legged in a corner, prepared to rest for some time within the hall. Of course, as a safety precaution, he summoned all of his Magical Beasts like the Withered Tree Warriors and Unicorn, in case a monster suddenly charged out from the Magical Spell Formation in the hall.</p> <p>The Earth Evasion spell was very useful, having proven itself in his multiple successful surprise attacks on the Spider Monster. Unfortunately, it took a lot of Wizard Power to use that technique. The Wizard Power expended was proportional to the distance of his teleportation. While he was inside the Spider Monster, he had been running on sheer willpower. Even though it would be safer to rest outside the cave, he was honestly too tired to move.</p> <p>After consuming a few Magical Beast Blood Essences, Yang Ling closed his eyes to rest. Even though there was a sufficient amount of energy within the hall, Yang Ling did not dare absorb it carelessly. If he was at his peak, he could have slowly investigated the energies, but since he was fatigued, it would be dangerous to act recklessly. He did not wish to be frozen into a popsicle by the billowing white fog.</p> <p>Could the entire cave be a relic left behind by an Ancient Wizard?</p> <p>Thinking back to the mysterious Wizard Formation in the stone forest outside the cave, and considering the immensely powerful Starlight Wizard Mantra, Yang Ling began his deliberation. According to the Spider Monster Abbas’ explanation, it had always been searching for traces of an Ancient Wizard. It was clear that it did not barge into this cave by coincidence. Perhaps it had discovered some secret long ago!</p> <p>How unfortunate, thought Yang Ling. It would have been great if he could have tamed the Spider Monster!</p> <p>Yang Ling smiled bitterly and shook his head. The Spider Monster’s unfathomably deep abilities and power meant it was amazing that he had escaped with his life. There was no way he could have tamed the Monster.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Spider Monster had a massive amount of mental energy. Merely a few roars from it could directly attack its enemies’ souls. He still did not have the ability to tame it given his current abilities. In fact, it might even backfire on him and cause him to be consumed by his own Wizard Powers.</p> <p>According to the explanation on the stele in the Wizard’s Pagoda, it was risky to try to tame a fierce beast that was at a higher level than oneself, especially when it came to taming creatures that had a higher mental energy. A moment’s carelessness could cause him to be consumed by the spell. He would at least mess up his mind, turn immediately into an idiot, or worse, vomit blood and die on the spot.</p> <p>After resting for a moment and feeling that he had regained a portion of his Wizard Power and stamina, Yang Ling retrieved the metal box that he had picked up from inside the Spider Monster. He could feel a familiar ripple coming from within. Even though the ripples were faint, they were definitely there.</p> <p>The metal box was light, its surface carved with the images of various Magical Beasts. A cursory look seemed to suggest that it was like the images on the Wizard’s Pagoda. But closer observation seemed to suggest a difference!</p> <p>After knocking on it and tossing it around a bit, yet being unable to open the box, Yang Ling had a thought. He bit his index finger and pressed it onto the metal box. Mysterious symbols appeared on the box’s surface, and it shone with a red light. It then clicked open, revealing a thin piece of vellum.</p> <p>Could this be another cultivating spell by the Tree Shepherds?</p> <p>Seeing the vellum, Yang Ling thought of the beast hide Sofia had gifted him, on which the Psychic Mantra was recorded. It was about the same size, and roughly the same material. In fact, even its contents were written in the same language…</p> <p>Temper the Blood Essence of Magical Beasts, gather the essence of all living things, strengthen the body and soul…</p> <p>After silently reading the words, Yang Ling got excited. It turned out that it was not a Psychic Spell recorded there, but a unique Wizard Mantra. It was used to strengthen the body by absorbing various energies.</p> <p>The Wizard Mantra on the stele taught him to come into contact with the origin of power in this world by training the soul. This new Wizard Mantra recorded on the vellum taught how to continuously refine the body and encounter the power source in this world by strengthening his physical body. They were two different means to the same end!</p>",
  "Chapter 141: Ancient Restriction": "<p>After committing the Wizard Mantra for honing the body to memory and making sure that he could recite it without any problems, Yang Ling searched the hall again, ensuring that he checked every nook and cranny.</p> <p>The box was carved with mysterious symbols that seemed to match the symbols seen elsewhere in the hall, so Yang Ling was fairly sure the Spider Monster acquired the box in the hall, and not elsewhere. Maybe there was other treasure for Yang Ling to find if he looked closely.</p> <p>As the sky darkened, the fog in the hall lightened, gradually subsiding. Perhaps some of the corners of the hall might still be a little dark to an average person, but to Yang Ling and his enhanced vision, it was not too difficult for him. He could see everything inside the hall even without the burning mud balls.</p> <p>Other than the few Magical Spell Formations, and a lone table meant for offerings, the hall was empty. The table was mottled and made from a hardy purple sandalwood. It was covered in a layer of tree oils, similar to paint, and gave off the scent of sandalwood.</p> <p>Behind the table were two giant footprints, as if a giant statue had been placed there many years ago, leaving behind two deep traces on the hard stone slab.</p> <p>At the center of the table was a long depression. Yang Ling tried and found that it fit the metal box perfectly. It looked like his guess had been correct that the Spider Monster had found the metal box in the hall and swallowed it whole when it discovered the box would not open. To think that it was him that found it in the end. It truly was fate!</p> <p>In front of the table was a giant Five Pronged Starlight Spell Formation. According to the Heavenly Fox Yuna’s explanation, this should be the Spell Formation that had sent the Heavenly Foxes abroad back then. The Magical Teleportation Formation could not be activated, despite the group’s combined best efforts. Perhaps years of neglect or a lack of power was responsible for the Formation’s stillness.</p> <p>“If we could activate this Magical Teleportation Formation, we might perhaps be able to find traces of the other Heavenly Foxes. How unfortunate!” The Fox Elder sighed in frustration.</p> <p>If he could activate the mysterious Teleportation Formation, he might be able to receive the Heavenly Foxes’ support. He might even manage to transport his clan abroad to a new continent, just like in the legends.</p> <p>Heavenly Fox Yuna also sighed in frustration. Her attempts to help had not awakened the Formation either. Compared to the Fox Elder, she had hoped even more that she could activate the Magical Teleportation Formation. On the other side of the Teleportation Formation were her clansmen, everything she had been looking forward to. Where the Heavenly Foxes had gone, there was no human greed, no endless wars. It was paradise for the Beastmen, the holy land for her race.</p> <p>“Being unable to open it now does not mean that there will be no way to activate it in the future! I believe that one day, we will be able to activate this Magical Spell Formation!” Yang Ling smiled encouragingly at the Heavenly Fox Yuna and the Fox Elder, and then continued searching the hall. He was personally more interested in the hall itself. He had a feeling that it hid many secrets of an Ancient Wizard.</p> <p>The hall’s wide door was covered in many images. In an average person’s eyes, this was a mysterious, ancient Magical Spell Formation. But Yang Ling recognized it as a high level Wizard Formation. Someone had added an obscure Killing Formation and an Illusory Formation to the foundation of a Spirit Gathering Spell Formation, which created the hall’s persistent white fog.</p> <p>This Wizard Formation caused the Spider Monster to become trapped inside the hall. The spell became stronger with every full moon, stunting the Spider Monster’s growth and preventing its advancement, thereby ensuring its long term incarceration. It also prevented the Spider Monster from ever attaining Sage-level.</p> <p>Other than the mysterious symbols, there were also images of priests grovelling on the floor and praying carved onto the ground. It might have been more accurate to call the hall an ancient, divine temple.</p> <p>Could this be a divine temple at which the Ancient Wizard prayed?</p> <p>Yang Ling considered the images carved into the ground, and the giant footprints behind the offering table, and thought that it fit. He couldn’t imagine why someone would move the deity’s statue away, but it was clear to him that the Ancient Wizards might have lived in the temple some hundreds of years ago. Perhaps that was also the reason why the Spider Monster, that had looked for tracks of the Ancient Wizards everywhere, would come into that place despite the white fog’s danger.</p> <p>Could the Ancient Wizards have all moved to the new continent behind the Magical Teleportation Formation, just like the Heavenly Foxes did?</p> <p>Yang Ling wondered. Perhaps the Ancient Summoners had created a Teleportation Formation in the divine temple after having found a new continent abroad, then performed a mass migration. Sometime after that, the Heavenly Foxes discovered this secret and moved their entire tribe away too.</p> <p>When Yuna’s forefathers arrived late and coincidentally got blocked by the Spider Monster that inhabited the temple, the fierce battle unintentionally activated the Wizard Formations at the entrance of the divine temple and outside the cave. From then on, the two Wizard Formations circulated automatically, making it such that outsiders would not be able to enter and those inside would not be able to exit!</p> <p>As Yang Ling was deep in thought, Argus led in a large group of warriors and was cleaning up the bloody battlefield quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>They collected the useful corpses and Blood Essence of the spiders and buried those they had no use for. Finally, a few of the Spellcasters cleaned up the last traces of blood using water element magic spells. With so much manpower, they managed to clean out the place in just over an hour, the metallic stench of blood in the air finally subsiding.</p> <p>After exploring the place countless times and confirming that there weren’t any treasures, the group turned to leave, heading out of the cave to rest, while Yang Ling stayed behind under his Magical Beast army’s protection.</p> <p>As far as the group was concerned, there were no other items inside the temple worth harping over, other than the inactive Teleportation Formation. But in Yang Ling’s eyes, the Wizard Formation at the entrance of the divine temple, the white fog that did not scatter, and the symbols left on the ground were all treasures of which he could never have enough.</p> <p>He sat down cross legged, and silently recited the Body Honing Wizard Mantra he had found on the vellum. Pulsing, his Wizard Core pushed his Wizard Power, causing it to circulate around his body.</p> <p>At the start, he did not notice anything changing, as if the Body Honing Wizard Mantra was not effective. But with the Wizard Power circulated faster and faster within his body, and he began to feel heat released wherever the Wizard Power had passed.</p> <p>Soon, as the temperature rose, the Wizard Power seeped into every inch of his muscles, into every inch of his bones. At the same time, his body was slowly absorbing the white fog within the divine temple, every pore in his body expanding.</p> <p>The faster his Wizard Power circulated, the more of the white fog he absorbed. The boiling hot Wizard Power caused his muscles to expand, while the icy cold white fog contracted them. One hot and the other cold, the energies created a cycle.</p> <p>Some time later, Yang Ling felt the symbols in the divine temple become clearer. His mental energy spread outward like a spider’s web, slowly touching the images carved onto the ground, walls, and roof. Then, the images clearly appeared within his mind.</p> <p>Could this be a so-called restriction?</p> <p>There were many symbols in the divine temple. Even though he was unable to understand them right away, Yang Ling understood that there were several mysterious Wizard Formations within the divine temple, each one layered onto the last.</p> <p>Originally, he had thought that there was only the Wizard Formation at the entrance of the divine temple other than the Teleportation Formation before the offering table. But after he freed his mind and touched the vast wizard symbols, he realized how wrong he had been!</p> <p>On the surface, the wizard symbols and images seemed to share no connection with each other, but as Yang Ling came to understand, all of the wizard symbols were bound tightly together with energy, forming a many layered Wizard Formation. According to the explanation on the stele, this was beyond the classification of a Wizard Formation; instead it was a restriction set up by a high level Wizard.</p> <p>According to the stele, Wizard Techniques were split into seven levels. The level of Blood Wizard was preparation for the beginner stage, and Spirit Wizards were equivalent to apprentices. Only when one cultivated their abilities to the level of Earth Wizard did they truly step into the beginning stages.</p> <p>Even when one had cultivated their abilities to the level of Earth Wizard and formed the Wizard Core, the training had only just begun. They could gain understanding of several mysterious spells only after they cultivated their abilities to the level of Heaven Wizard, Divine Wizard, or Soul Wizard. Amongst those, one would come into preliminary contact with restrictions only at the later stages of Heaven Wizard. It would be risky to try to forcefully cultivate this technique.</p> <p>“So that’s the case; it’s no wonder that it could release this strange white fog. It is no wonder that even the terrifying Spider Monster would be trapped here alive for thousands of years!”</p> <p>Yang Ling stood up cautiously, not daring to forcefully investigate the secrets of this divine temple. He was afraid that he might activate a deeper restriction if he was not careful.</p> <p>Yang Ling recalled his protective Magical Beasts and left the cave quickly. Then he took a deep breath and began testing out his moves. He soon realized that he was able to pierce through the light armor the barbarians wore with his fist, and at full thrust, he was even slightly stronger than the Horned Bee Beasts.</p> <p>It looked like the Body Honing Wizard Mantra on the vellum was powerful indeed. His constitution had improved dramatically in just a few hours! Yang Ling was confident that he would be able to escape successfully with his Tree Eyes ability even if he was unable to retaliate if he encountered a Heaven-ranked Assassin in the forest.</p> <p>The teleportation-like Earth Evasion technique, top notch speed, immense strength, and full stamina all allowed him to have a certain level of self defense even without Magical Beasts aiding him in battle. He was much more powerful than a Blood Wizard that could only tame Magical Beasts and had no further offensive capabilities.</p> <p>After eating their fill, the group started discussing the next step of their plans with excitement.</p> <p>“Sir, after this, we have to conduct a large scale development of the sulfur mine as soon as possible!” Pulling his white beard, the Fox Elder shared his opinion.</p> <p>Taking in a mouthful of warm alcohol, the Ox Chief corroborated the Fox Elder’s suggestion and added, “That’s right, with enough sulfur, we can accelerate the cultivation of the Black Pulp Trees and create more mud balls!”</p> <p>The Ox Chief was largely fine after the fierce battle due to the timely treatment. Only the Medusa leader was still weak, having sustained severe injuries. If Yang Ling had not fed her a few Magical Beast Blood Essences in time, she might not have survived.</p> <p>“Excavating a mine requires a lot of manpower. We need resources like tools and rations. We cannot rush these things!” Deliberating for a moment, Yang Ling continued, “In order to excavate the sulfur mine over a long period of time, we will also need to build a decent mountain fortress to facilitate our control over the Taildon Valley. We might as well build a city in the nearby mountains while we are preparing our resources!”</p> <p>The sulfur mine, underground crystal vein, ancient divine temple, and the mysterious ancient entrapment…</p> <p>After understanding the worth of the Taildon Valley, Yang Ling began deliberating how he could control the valley securely. Of course, it would be even better if he could rally the Bullmen, Foxmen and Medusas scattered around the Ladak Mountain Range under his rule, so as to obtain much cheap labor and many warriors.</p>"
