  "Chapter 1: The Betrayal of Human Beings": "<p>In Eastern China’s Sea City…</p> <p>Sea City used to be one of the economically developed cities which had huge populations. But at present, it had degraded into a wasteland of dilapidation, without a trace of human habitation, and only a swarm of slow-moving zombies lumbering through the city.</p> <p>At the moment, a scene was at play inside a closed room of a building in this deserted city…</p> <p>The room had no windows and only a door, which was locked as well. There was no furniture save for a bed. It used to be a secret resting room in the CEO’s office of a large company.</p> <p>From the ought-to-be empty room came some small sounds which could cause faces to blush and hearts to beat faster. On the bed inside the room, an act of forced sex was happening. However, nobody could have imagined that the one suffering this unspeakable act was a man, lying on the bed and unable to move.</p> <p>An hour later, a woman walked out of the room, her face filled with satisfaction. Although she wasn’t ugly, her makeup was too heavy. Her lips were red as blood, and her face was caked in a layer of white foundation. The thick eyeshadow had obscured the original shape of her eyes. Her thick, long eyelashes fluttered down, lightly covering her eyes.</p> <p>She had a body that could make men obsessed and women jealous. She was tall, with curves in all the right places—fullness in the chest, a soft, wasp waist, with a gently rounded hip, underneath which was a pair of beautiful legs, which were straight, slim, and long.</p> <p>There was an office space outside the room. The three people who had been keeping watch there all turned to look at the woman as she came out, hints of contempt hidden in their eyes.</p> <p>“Time to go,” said the woman while beaming with satisfaction.</p> <p>While speaking, she drew out a gun and walked out of the office ahead of the others. She kept her back warily against the wall while moving toward the stairs. The three didn’t say anything, just pulled out their own guns and followed her out. But behind her, they silently exchanged glances loaded with an intent to murder.</p> <p>Back in the room with no windows, a man lay flat on the bed, unable to move. He had a very handsome face, though it was heavily flushed at that moment. His nose was straight, and his thin lips were pressed together into a straight line. His long and narrow eyes contained a strong murderous intent, and were turning red while staring at the ceiling. His face was twisted with a mixture of wrath and homicidal intent, and his teeth were clenched tightly.</p> <p>If he had found Ling Ling’s location, how could he ever have just meekly let that woman do such a thing to him?</p> <p>…</p> <p>But before long, the woman, whose face was a mask of heavy makeup, was knocked unconscious and thrown into a swarm of zombies. The zombies slowly slunk toward her before pouncing, biting, and tearing.</p> <p>She woke up with an excruciating, tearing pain, her screams splitting the air around her, “Ah! Ling Yong! Liu Hongshi! Liang Caiyan! You won’t get away! Ah… Ah… I’ll hunt you, and I’ll find you… even as a zombie! Ah… Hahaha… Do you think I wasn’t prepared for this? The little girl isn’t there… Ah…”</p> <p>A twisted and savage smile appeared on her face while she was screaming. However, her heart-tearing screeches gradually faded, heard by nobody but the zombies.</p> <p>However, just as she was about to be torn into pieces by the zombies, a strong wave of energy suddenly erupted from her brain, propelling the zombies away from her body.</p> <p>After picking themselves up, all the zombies froze. They were confusedly rooted to their spots for a while before swaying away, and none of them noticed this ‘fresh food’ ever again.</p> <p>…</p> <p>A day later, a squad of soldiers showed up from the opposite direction and moved toward the other side of the city while firing their weapons at the zombies. This was the only path to be taken, with dense woods and parks on both sides. In this apocalyptic world, human beings would rather face zombies than the mutated creatures in those places.</p> <p>For this reason, all wooded areas had slowly been designated as forbidden areas.</p> <p>Lu Tianyu, who had been dead for a day, lay stiffly on the ground. She had this twisted expression in her face, as though she was still suffering the immense pain. Her body and limbs had become shreds of flesh and skin, barely recognizable as human.</p> <p>Her body was besmeared with blood, though she fortunately hadn’t been completely torn into pieces. She lay silently on the ground with a ghastly pale face, her gray eyes staring at the sky.</p> <p>Pale gray eyes… it was a characteristic of zombies.</p> <p>Suddenly, these pale and lifeless eyes moved. A living person would be scared literally to death if they saw this, because this was the early sign of the transition from human to zombie.</p> <p>Her eyes moved again… and again. All of a sudden, those pale gray eyes turned black. Not just the pupils, but even the whites of those eyes turned black in this instant. Slight changes had begun happening to her body in the meanwhile—her fingernails had started growing, turning sharp and hard, and she no longer smelled like something that had rotted.</p> <p>She moved slightly, then stiffly sat up on the ground, looking around blankly. About ten seconds later, she tried to stand up, quickly realizing that her body seemed to be not so under control.</p> <p>She tried for a few times, but couldn’t get up because her knees were stiff. She looked around for something to hold onto, but there was nothing nearby.</p> <p>At last, Lin Qiao had no choice but to try bending her knees. She spent quite a while to finally struggle to her feet, but once upright, she discovered something even more terrifying.</p> <p>She stared at her hands, stunned.</p> <p>There were purple-black dried blood stains under her black and sharp nails. Her arms were filthy, and all the skin and flesh had been chewed up, with only the pale white bones remaining. The skin on the back of her hands was bluish pale, also stained with black dried blood.</p> <p>Her entire body was stiff, and limbs were lacking coordination, so she felt off-balance.</p> <p>She was dumbstruck as she stared at her hands and then her body. She closed her eyes, unable to believe what she was seeing. She then reopened her eyes but found no change in this ravaged body of hers, which was barely in human shape.</p> <p>She raised her head and howled at the sky, ‘What the hell!’</p> <p>However, all that came out of her mouth was “Roarrrrrrrrrr!”</p> <p>Maybe her growl was too alien, that the zombies nearby who had been busily attacking the squad of human soldiers all halted simultaneously and then turned to look at her. The soldiers who had been defending against the zombies paused briefly as well, then like the zombies, turned to look at her.</p> <p>Human beings— <em>This zombie’s voice is so weird?</em></p> <p>Zombies— <em>What is this zombie shouting about?</em></p> <p>But soon, these human beings and zombies had forgotten about this weird zombie and continued fighting.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her hollowed stomach, dumbfounded.</p> <p>Damn it! What the hell was this? Who could tell her what on earth had happened? Was she dreaming?</p> <p>She raised her head and looked around, abruptly seeing two groups of people not far away. <em>‘Why does the outermost group look so much like the zombies from the movies?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>She looked around, and what came into her vision were the ruins of war. She saw dilapidated buildings and completely broken windows, with nothing left in the window frames. The scenes by the road were just as dismaying, and the traffic was paralyzed, and broken cars were abandoned either by the side of the road or right in the middle. Some of the streetlights had tilted, and some had fallen to the ground. Rubble and dust were scattered all around, and the looks of the trees had become fairly strange as well.</p>",
  "Chapter 2: Came Back to Life as A Zombie": "<p>Chapter 2 – Resurrected As A Zombie</p> <p>This strange environment made Lin Qiao feel out of her wits. She looked around in confusion while weighing this new reality. She must be dreaming! She must definitely be dreaming!</p> <p>She looked down at her stomach once again.</p> <p>Her stomach had been ripped from her body, so why was she still conscious? And, what was that strange sound she just made?</p> <p>She felt that she might be going crazy. She seemed to remember merely having a fever and taking some medicine, then falling asleep. So, how come the world had become like this by the time she woke up?</p> <p><em>‘Yes, I must be dreaming! I am dreaming! I am dreaming!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao repeated this in a bid to convince herself. She had fallen asleep after taking the medicine, and probably just hadn’t woken up yet.</p> <p>Otherwise, how could she feel nothing while her body was in this state?</p> <p>Before she could figure out anything, she suddenly sensed a dull ache in her brain. Strange memories that didn’t belong to her randomly flooded her mind, and the dull ache instantly augmented into a swelling pain that threatened to burst her head open. Her face immediately twisted in agony, then she opened her mouth wide and gave a shout.</p> <p>“Roarrrr!”</p> <p>With that, her body toppled sideways and fell to the ground.</p> <p>Within the memories, she saw an ordinary but adorable girl growing from a chubby toddler into a beautiful young lady. Every scene of the growing girl’s life, from primary school to middle school, and then to college, scrolled through Lin Qiao’s mind. This girl’s name was Lu Tianyu. She had been admitted to her dream college, and it should have been so wonderful. However, on her first day of college, the world suddenly changed.</p> <p>In the classroom, all the new students were looking curiously at each other while introducing themselves one after another. However, things started going wrong when it was the turn of a girl who had been lying motionlessly on her desk.</p> <p>No matter how loudly the other students called her, the girl wouldn’t wake up. Someone even pushed her, yet she still would not wake. The teacher had no other choice but to ask two male students to help her to the infirmary. However, right at the time when the two male students reached the door of the classroom with this unconscious girl, she suddenly opened her eyes.</p> <p>Furthermore, those eyes were pale gray in color. She didn’t say a word after opening her eyes, but abruptly turned her head two seconds later and opened her mouth wide. Baring her teeth, she bit the neck of one of the two male students who had been holding her.</p> <p>Shrill screams spread throughout the entire building,</p> <p>The others hurriedly pulled the male student away from the girl, but he had already fainted. On the other side, the girl who bit him had become so incredibly strong that even a couple of male students couldn’t hold her down. They just helplessly watched her hurt some other students by biting and scratching them.</p> <p>The same thing began happening throughout the city, attracting the attention of the government and local police. On that day, all available police and military forces were called out to deal with these strange and frightening events.</p> <p>That night, a strange hush blanketed the world, and the people woke up the next morning to find their world destroyed.</p> <p>Only thirty percent of all human beings in the world woke up as themselves, while the remaining seventy percent had all turned into slow-moving zombies with no real consciousness, just the insanely strong desire to eat human beings!</p> <p>In fact, these memories were utterly disordered, but Lin Qiao slowly managed to put all the pieces together. Even though many parts were missing, she was still able to confirm one thing…</p> <p>These memories all belonged to somebody else!</p> <p>From the memories of this girl called Lu Tianyu, Lin Qiao learned another fact-since the apocalyptic era started, five years had passed!</p> <p>The apocalyptic era began just the day after she took the medicine the last time for her fever and fell asleep.The next morning, many people woke up as senseless zombies that could do nothing but bite every living person they saw. Of course, many others woke up as normal people. And, there were still others who looked normal in appearance, but their physical quality had been drastically changed.</p> <p>The last type of people were the ones who triggered their superpowers soon after.</p> <p>By now, Lu Tianyu was twenty-three years old.</p> <p>In Lu Tianyu’s memories, she did not wake up in the apocalyptic world as a zombie or with a triggered superpower, but as an ordinary person.</p> <p>In this war-ridden and chaotic apocalyptic world, she was completely defenseless.</p> <p>Therefore, she had to bargain for survival with her body and clever schemes. Luckily, she had a beautiful face. In the apocalyptic world, the number of women had dropped so dramatically that ninety percent of the people in a base were men, while only ten percent were women. Women had become like rare animals, so she was quite popular being a beautiful woman.</p> <p>She had been good at scheming ever since she was a child. She framed people and played all kinds of dirty tricks just to survive in this dangerous, chaotic world.</p> <p>It was strange that Lin Qiao recalled many of Lu Tianyu’s memories, but not all of them. She felt that there were still a lot of things that she hadn’t recollected yet. For example, she couldn’t see anything that Lu Tianyu had done recently.</p> <p>Twenty years of strange memories filled her mind. Lin Qiao was a little confused, so much so that she nearly lost herself and forgot who she was. Was she Lin Qiao? Was she Lu Tianyu?</p> <p>Fortunately, while she was gripped by an awful headache, a coolness spread through her brain, triggering her own memories and stopping her from becoming Lu Tianyu fully.</p> <p>She touched her body and found that her clothes barely covered her body. She lowered her head and looked down at her hollowed stomach, as well as her zombie-eaten breasts.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to cry, but no tears would come out. She had confirmed one thing—she had become someone else because she had returned from death in someone else’s body! She wondered if her own body had woken up in that world-ending morning like the others. Or perhaps it had become a female zombie who knew nothing except biting every human being it saw!</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! Even a rebirth should at least put me into a living person’s body! It could be male or female, old or young! What does this broken zombie body mean? Even if I have to live in a zombie body, I should at least have one that is whole!’ </em>She screamed in her heart.</p> <p>Depressed, Lin Qiao raised her head and roared, “Roarrrrrrr!”</p> <p>The zombies around her seemed to sense her discontentment, as they all quieted down suddenly. Then, something weird happened—all of the zombies around her slowly moved away from her, and an area was soon vacated around her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao lay on the ground, looking around with a strong and strange sensation lingering in her mind.</p> <p>From Lu Tianyu’s memories, she learned about the changes and developments of the apocalyptic world, and some things that Lu Tianyu had done after the old world ended. Although these memories were incomplete, they were enough for Lin Qiao to learn that Lu Tianyu was the most disgusting and despicable woman in the entire base. She traded for precious resources in the beds of different men, and evilly caused the deaths of many innocent people. However, beautiful women were even more popular in an apocalyptic world like this than they used to be in the old world.</p> <p>Five years… five whole years had passed. All the people in the base had known that Lu Tianyu was an evil, calculative, and sl*tty woman.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao couldn’t understand why she hadn’t woken up that morning when the old world ended instead of five years later. Why did it take her five years?</p> <p>What about her family? Her comrades? Were they still alive?</p> <p>No, she couldn’t be like this! She needed to find her mother, brother, sister-in-law, sister, and others! She needed to know how they had been all this while, and whether they had turned into zombies or superpowered ones!</p>",
  "Chapter 3: Stolen Clothe": "<p>Chapter 3 – Stolen Clothes</p> <p>“Hurry… There’re too many zombies… Watch out on your left!”</p> <p>“This side is blocked… There’s no way through…”</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>“Lin Yu…”</p> <p>“Don’t go over there! Lin Yu’s hand has been scratched by zombies…”</p> <p>“Don’t come over! Captain! Don’t let me turn into a zombie… Hm… Kill me now… I… Captain…”</p> <p>“Lin Yu! Lin Yu!”</p> <p>On the other side, the battle situation had now changed. The result of the battle was tipping in favor of the zombies as some human squad members had been wounded.</p> <p>“Captain… Take care of my… sis-sister… for me…”</p> <p>…</p> <p>“No! Lin Yu! You hang in there! That’s an order! What would Lin Yan do if you died?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t hear these conversations with her ears. Instead, the words just appeared in her mind. In addition to these, she had also been hearing other voices, some of which were repeating two words over and over.</p> <p><em>‘So hungry… So hungry… So hungry…’</em></p> <p>These voices were like tiny hammers that had been ceaselessly pounding her brain. Because of them, Lin Qiao suffered a splitting headache once again. She bared her teeth in pain, slowly twisting her body to struggle.</p> <p>“Captain… you go! I have got your back! I’ll save a bullet for myself! You go now!” Lin Yu gripped his gun with both hands and blew a zombie’s head off with a bullet each as he shouted at Captain Li Zheng.</p> <p>However, Li Zheng wasn’t swayed. “No! Lin Yu, we must return with the same number of people as we came out with. I can’t leave you here alone!” He insisted.</p> <p>Lin Yu shouted hysterically, “Captain! There are too many zombies! We can’t all leave! Someone has to stay and cover the rear. I’m already infected by the virus! I’ll become a zombie whether I make it back or not! Let me do this!”</p> <p>For some reason, Lin Qiao felt a jolt of recognition when she heard the name ‘Lin Yu’. However, the piercing pain in her head stopped her from thinking clearly, making her tumble on the ground while screaming and pounding her head with her hands.</p> <p>“Roar…”</p> <p>Waves of pain distorted her perception of the surrounding environment. By the time she recovered, another day had passed away.</p> <p>She lied on the ground while gazing at the sky. She had no idea how long she had lain there. The only sensation available to her right now was hunger. She was so starving!</p> <p>However, when she covered her stomach with her hands, her stiff hands only found a hole.</p> <p>She was speechless.</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! I don’t even have a stomach! How could I still be hungry?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to stand up, but she immediately realized that her body would not obey this command.</p> <p>Why wouldn’t her knees bend? How was she supposed to stand up like this?</p> <p>After struggling on the ground for a while, Lin Qiao finally got up.</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! The life of a zombie is so hard!’ </em>She was starving, but what could she do? She wanted to eat so, so badly! Even though she wanted to find her family, she needed to fill her ‘stomach’ to give herself the strength to look for them!</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her nose, sniffed around and sensed a faint, sweet aroma.</p> <p>She lowered her head to look at her stomach and chest, then raised her stiff arms, trying for some time to bend her finger joints and pull at her ragged clothes.</p> <p><em>‘Hmm, these rags can’t cover my body.’</em></p> <p>It seemed that she needed to find some decent clothes to cover herself with first.</p> <p>She was now a zombie. How was she supposed to live her life hereafter? What should she do when she was hungry? Eat human beings? That wouldn’t be possible! But, would she starve to death if she didn’t eat human beings? She could always replace human beings with other living things, right?</p> <p>Lin Qiao moved her feet and tried to walk forward, but she found that her extra heavy legs were as stiff as her arms. Thus, it was extremely hard for her to walk normally.</p> <p>She could only move slowly toward a shopping mall step by step.</p> <p>In this apocalyptic world which had been deserted for five years already, Lin Qiao had no idea why didn’t she wake up until now, neither did she know if her family survived the destruction of the old world, or if they were even alive right now.</p> <p>She should at least go back to her hometown and try finding them. However, finding a way back seemed to be a little difficult under the current circumstances! The internet had been paralyzed in the city, and telecommunication was already impossible. The ruins lay everywhere, making Lin Qiao feel awfully disturbed. She watched the zombies shamble all over the place, and even wondered if she should feel lucky for becoming a conscious zombie. After all, it would be much more convenient for her to move around like this.</p> <p>To go back to her hometown, she needed to find a car first. She could only go back once she had transportation. However, at this moment, finding some clothes was a more pressing matter. However, even after putting in quite a lot of effort in searching through the entire shopping mall, she failed to find any wearable clothes, or even suitable fabric!</p> <p>Even more annoyingly, the search had exhausted her highly disabled body.<em>‘Strange! Why would zombies feel tired?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat by the front entrance of the shopping mall while struggling with this question. She raised her head and glanced at the sky, finding that it was noon already. She then glanced across the zombies lumbering around and suddenly had an idea.</p> <p>She could borrow clothes from those zombies, couldn’t she?</p> <p>With this thought, she fixed her eyes on a female zombie in a long dress and stood up immediately, walking toward it.</p> <p>“Roar… Roar… oar!”</p> <p>What she had said was, ‘You! Stop!’.</p> <p>The female zombie stopped moving and turned her already-broken neck while tilting her pale face at an impossible angle toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Roar?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at the female zombie’s pale gray eyes with her own pure black ones and continued roaring, “Roar… roar… roarrrrrr!”</p> <p>‘Lend me your clothes,’ she said.</p> <p>“Roar?”</p> <p>Clearly, this zombie wasn’t intelligent, and was having trouble understanding her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stopped roaring, walked straight up to the female zombie, and raised a hand to rip her clothing.</p> <p>“Roar!” The female zombie suddenly went crazy and raised her zombie claws to scratch Li Qiao’s face when she saw the latter trying to rip off her clothes. Lin Qiao instinctively tilted her head and dodged the claws while slapping the female zombie’s face at the same time.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>This female zombie’s head, which was tilted on her neck, was slapped off clean by Lin Qiao and fell onto the ground.</p> <p><em>‘Hmm? Eh?? Damn it! How could it just fall off? Was it no more than a piece of skin that was holding her neck and head together before?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was astounded, gazing at her own claws. Had she grown stronger? Or, was the head falling off already?</p> <p><em>‘This zombie should have followed my words while I was being nice! How dare it attack me first?’ </em>Lin Qiao raised a foot and angrily kicked the headless zombie.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>The zombie fell onto the ground.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slowly moved toward the female zombie and tried to squat down beside it…</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! I can’t even bend my knees!’</em></p> <p>In the end, she directly sat on the ground.</p> <p>She bent down from the waist and ripped off the female zombie’s clothes. Fortunately, her fingers were still agile.</p> <p>With more than a little difficulty, she finally managed to put on the zombie’s gray, dusty dress. She then crooked her stiff hands, buttoned up the dress, and dusted it off. Finally, she looked a little more respectable now.</p> <p>At this moment, Lin Qiao again caught a whiff of the attractive aroma and followed it slowly.</p> <p>She was so hungry! She needed to find the source of that aroma and figure out if it were edible.</p> <p>After pondering briefly, Lin Qiao moved her stiff legs and followed the aroma step by step. However, her movements were agonizingly slow. She had no way to speed up, because her legs wouldn’t allow it. If she forced them, she would just end up falling face down on the ground.</p>",
  "Chapter 4: Strong Claws": "<p>These zombies were all slow in reacting, so they barely responded to Lin Qiao’s roars. Only when Lin Qiao roared a couple more times with a very strong repelling vibe did these zombies move aside. As she roared, they moved slightly, and as she roared again and again, they moved further bit by bit.</p> <p>The closer she got to the aroma, the more zombies could be seen gathered around. When she arrived at a closed warehouse, she sensed that the aroma was coming from inside. However, a swarm of zombies was sticking themselves on the door.</p> <p>One step, two steps, three steps… Without a watch, she had lost track of time, so she could only count her footsteps while walking very slowly.</p> <p>When she had walked for about five-hundred steps, she suddenly realized that the zombie crowd around her had grown quite dense. She didn’t like to be touched by these zombies, so she bared her teeth and roared at them as she walked.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar!” She roared at the zombies to try and make them go away while squeezing through the crowd. ‘Damn!’ She couldn’t get through as her limbs again refused to work according to her will.</p> <p>She felt irritated and burst into a great roar, “Roar! Roar!”</p> <p><em>‘Piss off!’ </em>She tried to say.</p> <p>After she uttered this last roar, the zombies around her all paused and then turned to look at her. Perhaps, her voice had made them feel provoked.</p> <p>“Roarrrr!” Unexpectedly, all of them roared back at Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! Do they want a fight?’ </em>Lin Qiao wondered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at these completely defaced zombies and stopped roaring. Then, she raised a hand and jabbed her claws directly into the head of a zombie beside her.</p> <p>For some reason, the movement of her hand was like a conditioned reflex and some kind of instinct once she intended to attack. By the time she realized what was happening, she found her fingers sticking straight in the zombie’s head.</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! Have my fingers somehow turned into steel or stone? How can these fingers penetrate a zombie’s head?’ </em>Lin Qiao pulled out her fingers and raised them in front of her, staring at them in shock.</p> <p>“Roarrrr!” The other zombies all began drawing back as if they had received some kind of danger signal when they saw Lin Qiao piercing a zombie’s head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at her fingers. To reconfirm, she reached out her left arm and gripped a zombie on her left side, which had just taken two steps backward. Amidst the zombie’s howls, she raised her right hand and fiercely stabbed her fingers into its head.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>As expected, she penetrated the zombie’s skull easily. Then, she put forth her strength with her arms and fingers.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>The zombie’s head was split into two pieces, which then fell onto the ground.</p> <p>Following a silvery noise, Lin Qiao lowered her head and saw a fingertip-sized, white-colored, prismatic crystal piece fall out of the zombie’s head. She glanced at this crystal piece with surprise, wondering if she should squat down to pick it up.</p> <p>She hesitated because her knees wouldn’t bend at all! Fortunately, her waist was a little more flexible now, and allowed her to stoop down.</p> <p>She tried to stoop and then reach down her hands to pick up this crystal piece. She managed to stoop a little, but felt some difficulties when she bent her waist to ninety degrees. She gritted her teeth and at last managed to pick up the crystal, straightening back up and then sighing in relief.</p> <p>What she didn’t notice was that after she picked up the crystal shard, the surrounding zombies had moved even farther backward.</p> <p>She pinched the crystal piece and sensed a faint warmth coming from it. She didn’t know that if she were just an ordinary zombie, she would have been incinerated by this crystal piece without leaving even a single piece of bone.</p> <p>However, she held it with her claws and nothing happened.</p> <p>She intended to take a closer look at this tiny crystal piece while pitching it with her fingernails to find out exactly what it was. However, a beam of black light suddenly flashed across her nails and the crystal piece first turned to vapor, disappearing slowly. It had vaporized, leaving nothing but a wisp of smoke.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt nothing else but a warmth flowing through her body for a moment.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? What happened?’ </em>She stared at her black fingernails in bewilderment. She observed them on both sides for quite a while, but failed to find an answer. So, she gave up trying.</p> <p>She turned her head again toward the door, from where the aroma was coming. At this moment, she suddenly found that the area was already vacated. Moments earlier, this place had been crowded with zombies. But now, all the zombies had retreated back seven to eight meters away from her.</p> <p>She glanced at these zombies with confusion, then slowly walked toward the door. She raised both hands to push the door, but was unable to even budge it.</p> <p>The door was made from aluminum alloy. She scratched the door with her fingernails and caused a squeaking noise, then raised her hands while wondering if her claw was stronger or the door.</p> <p>Glancing at the door lock, she realized that she would have to do things in a smarter way if she couldn’t break the door.</p> <p>She walked over and bent down, then began studying the door lock.</p> <p>A zombie was studying a door lock… If a living person were to see this, it would make them raise their eyebrows or even have their eyeglasses falling off.</p> <p>Lin Qiao dug into the keyhole and scratched, but still failed to unlock the door. As a result, she got angry and violently poked her fingers into the crack of this tightly closed door.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>She actually penetrated the door!</p> <p><em>‘Even that worked?’</em></p> <p>She moved her fingers in the crack and put forth her strength to push the door aside. However, nothing happened until she held her breath and pulled the door with all her might. The door was distorted a bit due to her strength, showing a small slit which allowed her to reach her hands in and unlock the door from the inside.</p> <p>Once the door opened, the aroma filled up her nostrils as she pushed the door open and walked inside. Although it was all dark inside, she found that she could see everything clearly.</p> <p>She looked at the source of the aroma. However, the moment she saw it clearly, her face darkened.</p> <p>And that was because it was a person!</p> <p>It was a person lying on the ground, but she couldn’t tell if the former was alive or not.</p> <p>She walked over while realizing that the aroma being emitted from this person was like that of grilled pork, making her feel exceptionally hungry!</p> <p>She stooped down beside this person like an old man. She felt that she was drooling and her claws had reached out to this human being while she was sensing this person’s aroma.</p> <p>However, just as her claws were about to pierce into this man’s head, she suddenly realized what she was doing and immediately withdrew her claws.</p> <p>Damn it! Was she eating people now?</p> <p>She straightened up, but then stooped again to poke this man’s face with her nails. She could sense a faint warmth being transmitted through those nails.</p> <p>She drew back her claws and looked at this man with shock.</p> <p>He was not dead!</p> <p>However, from what she could see, he had been infected with the virus already, hadn’t he?</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at his face. His skin hadn’t changed much, but his lips had already turned blue.</p> <p>While Lin Qiao was wondering what to do with this man who was about to turn into a zombie, she was suddenly inflicted with a headache so sharp that she felt that her brain was exploding.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>She raised her head and screamed in pain. She opened her dark eyes as wide as she could and bared her sharp teeth. It seemed that her pair of canine teeth had grown especially long.</p> <p>In the next second, Lin Qiao’s body tilted sideways and she fell onto the man’s body.</p> <p>All of a sudden, a wave of green light flashed across her vision, then both of them disappeared. The warehouse was left empty, without the slightest trace of any living things.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s head still ached dully when she woke up, only to be dumbfounded once she opened her eyes.</p> <p><em>‘What the hell? What is this place? Why am I in a strange place every time I wake up and open my eyes?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao widely opened her black eyes and hurriedly lowered her head to check her body. However, she discovered with disappointment that her broken body hadn’t changed, neither had her dress.</p> <p>However…</p>",
  "Chapter 5: An Inexplicable Space": "<p>Lin Qiao turned her head and found herself surrounded by refreshing greenery. The air was fresh, clean, and natural. It felt unpolluted by modern industry.</p> <p>Even though it was just grass around her, seeing this sea of lush green brightened her mood considerably.</p> <p>She struggled for a while with stiff movements, and finally stood back up before accidentally slipping and falling again.</p> <p>She felt that her mouth was gaping open and that her sharp teeth seemed to have pierced through something. She was startled when she saw it clearly, and immediately pulled out her teeth to sit up.</p> <p><em>‘Oh my!’ </em>There was a person beside her, the infected man whom she had seen earlier. She fell onto his body and… seemed to have bitten him.</p> <p>Why was this man here with her? Furthermore, what was this place? How did she get here?</p> <p>She raised her head and looked at the white sky, but saw no sun.</p> <p>She then turned her head to look around and found that along with the grassland was actually a small, glistening lake. She was delighted by the sight of the lake, as she immediately took one step and started moving toward the lake.</p> <p>It had been midsummer the last time she had woken up. Even though she couldn’t feel the heat anymore since becoming a zombie, she could not stand her broken and dirty body.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao didn’t notice the strange change which had come over the face of the dying man who had the virus spreading all over his body. His pale skin had slowly returned to its normal color, and the blueness was fading from his lips. Obviously, this meant that the virus was leaving his body. Although at a very slow rate, it would gradually disappear over time.</p> <p>In fact, at that moment, the virus was disappearing fastest from his chest that had been accidentally bitten by Lin Qiao just then.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew nothing about any of this as she excitedly walked toward the small lake. The lake looked quite nearby, but it still seemed to take forever for her to get there.</p> <p>She lay face down by the lake and cupped her claws together to drink a few mouthfuls from it. Then, she took off her dress which had taken her some serious effort to put on. Looking at this devastated body, she could only imagine how cruelly Lu Tianyu had been attacked, and how much pain she had suffered before she died.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took off her ragged clothes and pants, then stooped down and washed them in the lake. It took a long time to clean these clothes and pants. She was a bit of a neat-freak, so she felt extremely uncomfortable on seeing this body of hers.</p> <p>As she stooped down further, her intestines fell out of her body.</p> <p>After that, she sat in the lake and cleaned her intestines with her hands before tucking them back into her belly. Then, she cleaned her ragged clothes once more and wrapped her stomach with them.</p> <p>As an OCD patient, she spent a long while to wrap herself and finally make herself look as clean and tidy as possible.</p> <p>She felt absolutely nothing while doing all this, although she knew it must look extremely weird for anyone else.</p> <p>After wrapping her belly, she began washing her arms and legs which were badly mutilated, covered in blood, and missing chunks of flesh in some parts.</p> <p>While doing so, Lin Qiao didn’t feel the energy that was slowly percolating into her blood through her wounds soaked by the lake water. This energy was causing her black, clotted blood to begin flowing again while her wounds had been healing themselves. No new flesh had grown back, but the wounds were scabbing over faster than before, and the virus had disappeared completely from her body by this point.</p> <p>She was still in the form of a zombie though, with a pale face and sharp teeth jutting out of her mouth.</p> <p>She didn’t notice any of these changes, just as she didn’t notice what had happened to the man. At this moment, she suddenly began to feel sleepy while bathing. Before she realized anything, she closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p> <p>Subsequently, she slept for three whole days.</p> <p>When she finally woke up, she found herself still soaking in the water. She moved slightly and turned around, crawling back to the bank.</p> <p>At this point, she suddenly realized that her legs had become quite agile.</p> <p>She stood by the lakeside, raised a foot, and put it back down. Then, she raised it again and put it down again… After that, she kicked out with a foot! Her legs were actually as flexible as those of healthy human beings!</p> <p>She opened her pure black eyes wide and looked at her hands, then glanced at her legs. She shook all her limbs, then bent her waist in different directions.</p> <p>She looked just the same as before, but felt much better.</p> <p>With delight, she suddenly closed her hand and tried punching out, actually managing to do it! Her punch lacked some strength, but it was swift enough.</p> <p>She wondered if her voice had recovered or not.</p> <p>She pondered over this for a while and then opened her mouth to say ‘Hello’.</p> <p>“Roar, roar!”</p> <p>A drop of sweat oozed out of her forehead when she heard her own roars. Her voice didn’t seem to have recovered.</p> <p>She sighed as she raised her head, then looked around and saw the man again. She didn’t know for how long she had lain in the water, but the man hadn’t woken up.</p> <p>She walked over to him and found that she could squat quite easily. His aroma had become so much stronger than earlier that it made her feel starving. She scratched his neck with her black nails, then raised her head to look at the sky with confusion.</p> <p>What on earth was this place? How did they get here? How could she get out?<em>‘Get out…’</em></p> <p>A bright light flashed across her eyes once she began to think about how to leave. Next, she lost her balance and fell onto the ground.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! what the hell?’ </em>By the time Lin Qiao could react, she was surrounded by complete darkness.</p> <p><em>‘What… What happened?’ </em>She had been underneath a white sky moments ago, so how could she suddenly fall into darkness?</p> <p>Fortunately, she still had sharp eyes and could see clearly even in the darkness. However, what she saw was like a black and white photo. She looked around, and just as she expected, the man was there as well.</p> <p><em>‘Wait! This place looks a little familiar.’</em></p> <p>She raised her head again and looked around, then recognized where she was. Wasn’t this the warehouse where she had broken the door, gone inside, and found this man? Why was she here again? Where were the grassland and the small lake? Where did they go?</p> <p>She stood up and turned around to take a peek outside the door. The outside was empty, with no zombies or anything else.</p> <p>She didn’t understand her situation. She had been in a different place just then, so how could she suddenly be back here?</p> <p>She replayed what had just happened, wondering which detail went wrong that had brought her back here.</p> <p>Right! Earlier in that place, she had been thinking about how she had gotten there, and how she could leave. Then, she ended up back in here.</p> <p><em>‘ ‘Out’? Yes! Did this mean ‘out’?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao had a vague sensation, so she raised her hand and touched her forehead.</p> <p>Could she go back in?</p> <p>As soon as this thought flashed through her mind, another bright light dazzled her eyes. When she came back to her senses, she saw the green grassland and that same small lake before her once again.</p> <p>This place really turned out to be some mysterious space! Did this mean that she was a superpowered one too? Did she have the space power?</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought about this unsurely as she touched her forehead with her sharp nails again. This time, she definitely felt something there between her eyebrows, something that seemed to be connected with this space.</p> <p>Was her superpower nucleus right inside her forehead? Lin Qiao tried to come up with another thought.</p>",
  "Chapter 6: Lin Yu’s Awakening": "<p><em>‘Out! I want to get out of here…’</em></p> <p>As a result, a white light flashed across Lin Qiao’s eyes. Before she realized what was happening, she was already back in the dark warehouse.</p> <p>It was truly a mysterious space! Realizing this, she started to get excited. She actually had a mysterious space! She could hardly believe it.</p> <p><em>‘I want to get in!’</em></p> <p>She muttered the words silently to herself once again, and as expected, she reappeared in that space.</p> <p>“Roarrrr!” She screamed with joy, although the sound that came out of her was certainly not pleasant to hear. She immediately shut her mouth and didn’t dare to make another sound as she was shocked by her own voice.</p> <p>She was starving now, but no food existed in this space, and all she could see were grasses and a lake in here. She couldn’t feed on grasses, could she?</p> <p>She walked toward the lake and gazed into the clear lake water. When she took a bath earlier in this lake, she had noticed that there were no living fishes in the lake.</p> <p>She thought for a while, then again said ‘out’ silently. A moment later, she was back in the warehouse once again.</p> <p>She was starving, but obviously couldn’t eat the man. So, she had no choice but to find some other food source. She was worried that this man would be eaten by the other zombies if she left him here. <em>‘Should I wake him up?’</em></p> <p>However, this man was turning into a zombie, wasn’t he? He would probably die soon, and then his body would stiffen. After that, he would turn into a zombie, stand back up, and lumber around like the others.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at this man. He surely couldn’t survive anyway, and would turn into a zombie soon. She struggled with her conscience for a while, but in the end, she just walked out.</p> <p><em>‘Forget it! I should just leave him here and take care of myself first.’ </em>She thought.</p> <p>She was a zombie now, and didn’t know what to do! She had learned from Lu Tianyu’s memories that certain kinds of people were capable of hunting zombies in this post-apocalyptic world.</p> <p>Those were the superpowered people.</p> <p>In the past five years, human beings had survived a huge disaster, and had gotten used to this new lifestyle soon after. They slowly adapted, and eventually, a small number of superpowered people emerged.</p> <p>The awakening of superpowers was so difficult that only one in ten thousand people could usually awaken a superpower. After five years, a great diversity of superpowers now existed in this new world.</p> <p>Lu Tianyu’s squad once had over a hundred people, but the number had gradually dwindled during the escape because of three superpowered people. Those three didn’t protect everyone because they believed that they had no obligation to do so. Being superpowered, they very much enjoyed their feeling of superiority, as the ordinary ones depended on them and admired them.</p> <p>In this apocalyptic world where people died every day, survival was the top priority! Therefore, the weak, ordinary people were simply ants to be trodden under the feet of these superpowered ones.</p> <p>Later on, some powerful superpowered people and military people who were already strong as ordinary human beings built a few bases. As more and more superpowered people emerged in the bases and grew stronger and stronger, the bases expanded in scale, and the residents started to carry out zombie-hunting missions. At the bases, people traded for food, which was the scarcest supply in this post-apocalyptic world, with zombie heads. Human beings developed, but zombies didn’t. Five years had passed, and these bases run by human beings grew larger and larger. Although the zombies were never eradicated, they were still witless, soul-less, and lacking mobility.</p> <p>If the situation continued, a great number of these zombies would probably be killed in a couple of decades.</p> <p>Not long after Lin Qiao left the warehouse, the man lying on the ground moved his eyelids and opened his eyes.</p> <p>Lin Yu sat up in confusion and found that he was surrounded by darkness, and could see nothing clearly except blurry shades of the evening outside the door.</p> <p>He sat there for a while in a daze, then slowly stood up and walked outside.</p> <p>What had happened to him? He remembered that he had locked himself in a warehouse. He felt his muscles becoming stiffer and stiffer, his skin stretching tight, and he knew then that he was turning into a zombie.</p> <p>Later on, his entire body stiffened, his limbs were too heavy to be lifted, and his eyelids were so heavy that he was unable to keep them open. At last, he couldn’t help but fall asleep. Back then, he realized that he might never be able to wake back up.</p> <p>When people next saw him, they would see nobody but a conscienceless zombie. Someone could shoot him in the forehead at any time, and then, he would not even exist as a zombie.</p> <p><em>‘But… But… What is happening? Have I died and become a ghost? Like a real ghost?’</em></p> <p>Lin Yu put his hand into his mouth and bit it.</p> <p>“Ouch! This hurts!” He had bitten too hard, howled in pain as a result. He couldn’t help but cover this hand with the other and leap around in pain.</p> <p><em>‘What happened? Didn’t I die?’ </em>After calming down, Lin Yu looked at his body, stunned at what he saw. He realized that his body wasn’t stiff anymore. He could feel his muscles relax as he walked outside.</p> <p>He thought of something suddenly and reached a hand down to his waist, then pulled out a military dagger, popped the blade, and cut the back of his hand with it.</p> <p>“Hmm?”</p> <p>The blade left a bleeding slash on his skin. He couldn’t see it in the dark night, so he put the wound near his mouth and licked it.</p> <p>Metallic, salty, and a little sweet… It was the taste of blood!</p> <p>He was a little confused. He had indeed been infected by the zombie virus, which he remembered clearly. He also remembered that his body had already begun to stiffen before he passed out. So, how come all those feelings were gone now?</p> <p>He was just like a healthy human being now, and even his blood was fresh.</p> <p>…</p> <p>While Lin Yu was examining the shocking changes in his body, Lin Qiao was already far away.</p> <p>She was starving!</p> <p>She raised her head and gazed at the starry sky. The stars were still there, but the moon was missing. It seemed that it was either the beginning or the end of the month on the Lunar calendar right now.</p> <p>Under the starlight, her vision became clearer.</p> <p>She needed to find some food!</p> <p>However, she didn’t know what she could eat. She was a zombie now, and what did zombies eat except human beings? It seemed that human food was no longer edible to her already!</p> <p>It was late, but Lin Qiao was still able to see everything clearly. She gave this some thought, then realized that she had no other choice but to walk around and see what she could find.</p> <p>Besides, she needed to find her family. She didn’t know if they were still alive, living in some corner of this world.</p> <p>She looked around for direction. She had learned where she currently was from Lu Tianyu’s memories, and knew that her hometown was located in the South, which had turned into the South Cloud Island Base. Lu Tianyu and her squad were heading to the Huaxia City Great Base, which was in the opposite direction. Therefore, to head South, she would need to turn around and to walk in the opposite way.</p> <p><em>‘Where should I go?’</em></p> <p>South Island was located in a seaside city in the South, and was more than a thousand kilometers away from Sea City in Eastern China. She didn’t have a map or a car, but If she wanted to go to South Cloud Island, she would need both of these things.</p> <p>However, she was a zombie now, so where could she find these two things? She thought about this for a moment, then decided to head to Huaxia City first, as it was the nearest city from here. She would have a chance to meet human beings around a human base, and once she met humans, she would be able to figure out a way to get a car and a map.</p> <p>Night time was filled with zombies strolling slowly through its depths and looking quite scary. Even though Lin Qiao was now a zombie herself, she was still apprehensive at the sight of these zombies swaying back and forth in the night.</p> <p><em>‘Just keep looking at them and you’ll get used to them! Just keep looking at them and you’ll get used to them! Just keep looking and you’ll get used to them!’</em></p> <p>Hypnotizing herself with these thoughts, she began heading North.</p>",
  "Chapter 7: The Aroma of Food": "<p>The only good thing about the nighttime was that it was much cooler without the scorching sun of the daytime.</p> <p>By now, Lin Qiao was walking in a more natural and much faster way. The stiff-legged feeling from before had completely disappeared.</p> <p>What had happened? Why was she so much more flexible now?</p> <p>She kept thinking about this while walking. Suddenly, her nose twitched as a trace of a strange aroma wafted toward her from an unknown source,</p> <p><em>‘Eh? This aroma! It has to be something edible!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao instinctively had this thought as she caught the aroma. This had to be the sweet smell of food. She raised her head to sniff it carefully, and found that it came from the woods on the left-hand side.</p> <p>She turned around and followed the aroma, walking into the woods comprising of the oddly shaped trees.</p> <p>The woods were completely dark, but that didn’t bother her as she now had an owl-like night vision and was able to see everything clearly.</p> <p>Her eyes were sharp, as was her sense of smell. It seemed that becoming a zombie wasn’t so bad after all.</p> <p>The closer she got to the woods, the stronger the aroma became. She had also detected some other faint aromas, but she didn’t give up on the one that she had caught in the first place. She moved through the woods, pushing aside the branches and vines with her hands to create a path where there was none.</p> <p>Some vines and leaves with thorns scratched her skin, but she felt nothing.</p> <p>She continued on into the woods, sensing the source of the aroma getting closer and closer.</p> <p><em>‘Almost there! Something edible! It’s something edible for zombies! It isn’t a human though, is it?’ </em>She prayed in her heart, promising herself that if the aroma belonged to a human, she would bite her own flesh off and eat that instead!</p> <p>She halted when reached a large tree and stared at the trunk near the roots. There was a hole in the tree trunk, which was where the aroma was coming from.</p> <p><em>‘It isn’t a human being! Thank god!’</em></p> <p>The hole was small, just the size of a human head. She squatted and lowered her head to look inside.</p> <p>Squeak!</p> <p>All of a sudden, a fist-sized figure darted out of the hole at lightning speed and flew directly at her face.</p> <p>There was no time for her to lift her arm and defend herself from it.</p> <p><em>‘Holy smokes! What the hell is that?’ </em>Feeling spooked, Lin Qiao unconsciously bared her sharp teeth and instinctively backed away while fiercely biting at the black creature.</p> <p>Squeak!</p> <p>A horrible shriek came from Lin Qiao’s mouth.</p> <p>To be exact, the shriek came from the thing in her mouth.</p> <p>She felt an intensely struggling lump of fur between her teeth. Sweet blood had been flowing from that thing into her mouth as her sharp teeth had bitten into it!</p> <p>Sure enough, the thing became limp after a short struggle.</p> <p>She raised her hand and removed the thing from her mouth to take a look at it, only to be struck speechless.</p> <p>Damn it! It was a very chubby mutant mouse.</p> <p>Lin Qiao dangled this dying mouse before her eyes to get a better look at it.</p> <p>After its mutation, this mouse hadn’t grown in shape, but its two front teeth were especially sharp and long, sticking out of its mouth on each side. This mouse’s fur was also much longer than that of normal ones.</p> <p>Lin Qiao licked the blood on her mouth. To her surprise, she actually felt no awful feelings. The blood in her mouth was fishy, sweet, and… acceptable.</p> <p>She smiled while holding the mouse by its tail.</p> <p>If this mutant mouse was edible, could she eat other animals as well? As to whether there would be any adverse effects, she would know only after finishing up this mouse.</p> <p>Squeak!</p> <p>At that moment, some strange noises were heard from inside the hole in the tree. Judging by the noise, Lin Qiao figured that those could be some baby mice.</p> <p>She put a hand inside the hole, and as expected, found a few tiny things which were extremely soft and smooth. When she saw the five to six furless baby mice on her palm, she suddenly had an idea. These baby mice weren’t even big enough to fill the gaps between her teeth, so she wondered if she could keep them in her space.</p> <p>With this thought, she concentrated and said one word inside her head.</p> <p>进去.</p> <p><em>‘In.’</em></p> <p>In the next second, she found herself on the lush grassland, with the large mouse in one hand and the baby mice in the other.</p> <p>She wanted to keep these baby mice, but she had already killed the adult mouse. She glanced at the adult mouse and then at the six baby mice.</p> <p>What should she feed them with? There was nothing here in this space but grass and lake water.</p> <p>She put the adult mouse aside, squatted down, and conveniently picked a handful of grass leaves. She then wadded them up with one hand before putting them on the ground and shaping them into a small nest. After that, she placed the baby mice inside the nest.</p> <p><em>‘Oh well, I’ll leave them here for now. I’ll just eat them if they can’t survive.’</em></p> <p>She turned around to look at the adult mouse, wondering how she would eat it as she had no tool to build a fire. Besides, she didn’t know if zombies needed their food to be cooked or not. What if cooked food gave her diarrhea? If that happened, would she keep on eating raw meat?</p> <p>She directly left the space with the adult mouse clutched in her hand.</p> <p>Looking around, she saw nothing but trees. She had walked a great distance from any human settlement, and couldn’t find anything to start a fire with in this wilderness.</p> <p>And unfortunately, she didn’t have a fire superpower.</p> <p>At last, she made up her mind while staring at the dead mouse, then lifted her claws and began to skin it with them.</p> <p>She didn’t feel much about eating mice, because she had once spent half a month in a forest during devil training. In the whole fifteen days, she survived by eating only what she could find in the forest. Back then, mice could be counted as a gourmet meal, as she and her teammates also dined on snakes, frogs, worms, and other creatures… However at that time, she and her teammates had one advantage, which was having a fire.</p> <p>But now…</p> <p>She sighed as she skillfully opened up the adult mouse. The mouse had a thin membrane under its skin, along which, Lin Qiao finished skinning the mouse quite easily without causing a bleed.</p> <p>She sharply twisted the mouse’s head off and threw it away, then gently sliced open the mouse from its chest all the way to below its belly button with her nail. After that, she dug out the intestines without breaking them, threw them away, and then scooped out the liver.</p> <p>She sniffed at it, and unexpectedly, she sensed no unpleasant smell. She then stuck out her tongue gave it an experimental lick, finding it to be soft and a little warm.</p> <p>She took a deep breath, then put the raw mouse liver into her mouth. She was a little too scared to chew it, so she held it in her mouth for a while. Surprisingly, it seemed a little sweet! She couldn’t help but bite into it.</p> <p>The texture of the mouse liver was soft and tender, and it was unexpectedly tasty, with no strong scent of blood or any other off-putting flavor. It was so sweet and soft that she only needed to chew a few times before finishing it off.</p> <p>After having her first taste of raw food, she felt less stressed about the whole thing. So, she put the mouse meat directly into her mouth and began to chew. In the end, she even chewed up the bones and swallowed them as well.</p> <p>At that moment, she suddenly thought of her stomach and hurriedly lifted her dress to look at her belly which was wrapped in cloth strips. She hesitated, not sure if she should unwrap the cloth to check whether her stomach was still inside her body or not!</p> <p>Earlier on, she hadn’t paid much attention except noting that only her intestines were exposed, and not the other organs.</p> <p>But now, she actually began to worry. If her stomach was gone, would the food that she just ate simply fall out?</p> <p>She touched her stomach and felt that it was still torn open though there was no discomfort. She thought about this and that strange sensation overcame her once again. When she had woken up, she saw that the stomach of this body had been ripped apart already. And yet somehow, she still felt hunger!</p> <p>This was the only feeling that zombies had, wasn’t it?</p>",
  "Chapter 8: The Evildoing Woman": "<p>The mouse meat had satiated her hunger slightly, but she was still hungry! She wanted more meat!</p> <p>While thinking, she sniffed the air once again. Some faint aroma came from afar, clearly indicating the presence of an edible source!</p> <p>She kept sniffing and couldn’t help but follow the aroma. She again squirmed through the woods, making her way out to reach an overgrown grassland. The grasses were tall, about a meter in height and reaching her thighs.</p> <p>She followed the aroma and noticed that it grew stronger and stronger after she reached this grassland. Yet, when she walked to a certain spot, the aroma disappeared. She looked down at the ground, feeling a strange certainty that the source of the aroma was underneath her feet.</p> <p>She squatted and looked down at the grassroots, finding a spot that had no grass growing over it.</p> <p>She raked the area with her claws and found the earth to be soft. There seemed to be a hole down there, possibly a rabbit hole.</p> <p>Without thinking, she began digging quickly with both her hands. She found that her new nails were especially useful as digging tools. These nails were even able to penetrate zombie skulls, so they surely encountered no resistance from mere earth.</p> <p>She wielded both her arms and dug very quickly! Soon enough, she had created a large hole which was connected to a tunnel as she kept digging through it.</p> <p>In just a few minutes, she had already dug half a meter deep into the ground. While she was digging, a gray figure suddenly sprinted out of the tunnel.</p> <p>Fortunately, Lin Qiao’s reactions were fast enough, plus she was already prepared. When the gray creature raced out, she thrust out her hand and clenched her fingers, catching hold of a fluffy animal.</p> <p>She lifted it up and took a look. <em>‘Wow! Such a big rabbit!’ </em>The size of this rabbit was no longer the same as that of ordinary rabbits. This rabbit in her hand was twice as big as regular rabbits, almost as big as a young Chinese rural dog.</p> <p>After seeing this gray rabbit, a thought flashed across Lin Qiao’s mind, <em>‘Now, this is a full meal!’</em></p> <p>The rabbit in her hand was quite fierce. It kicked its legs with a surprising strength and wielded its front paws wildly, intensely struggling and twisting its body to try and free itself from her grip.</p> <p>Her fingernails had already sunk into the rabbit’s skin as she seized the furry pelt on its back. The rabbit struggled so vigorously that Lin Qiao couldn’t help but bare her teeth, open her mouth, and bite its neck.</p> <p>About half an hour later, Lin Qiao wiped her mouth and looked at the clean rabbit fur in her hand.</p> <p>She wondered if she could collect the rabbit fur in her space.</p> <p>As she thought about this, she looked at the fur in her hand and said one word in her head.</p> <p><em>‘Collect!’</em></p> <p>As soon as she finished thinking the word, the furry pelt disappeared from her hand, vanishing into thin air.</p> <p><em>‘In!’</em></p> <p>After thinking that, she too disappeared without a trace, reappearing on the grassland a short while later.</p> <p>The reason she went inside the space was to check whether the rabbit fur was truly in there. As she expected, this space could collect things for her as well. To collect something, she didn’t need to take it in herself and only needed to touch it.</p> <p>Standing in the hole on the grassland, she was preparing to turn away and leave this place when she heard some noise from the rabbit hole that made her pause.</p> <p><em>‘Are there baby rabbits inside?’</em></p> <p>With this thought, she couldn’t help but squat again and put her hand inside the hole. A sudden stinging pain on her finger made her pull her hand back, and then she saw a fist-sized grey rabbit dangling from her finger.</p> <p>The baby rabbit was biting her finger and kicking its legs. Lin Qiao caught it with her finger as if she was fishing, feeling a little speechless.</p> <p>She then grabbed the rabbit with her other hand.</p> <p><em>‘Collect!’</em></p> <p>And just like that, the baby rabbit was stored in her space as well.</p> <p>She then put her hand back into the hole and continued rummaging, but found nothing even after spending a few minutes hunting through the hole.</p> <p>She sighed while standing up and raised her head to look at the sky, then turned around and walked back.</p> <p>Maybe because she was full now, some more fragments of Lu Tianyu’s incomplete memories popped up in her mind. While she was recollecting these disjointed memories, a throbbing headache hit her again. However this time, the pain wasn’t as bad as before.</p> <p>In these memories, a large group of soldiers had shown up in a field camp, Lu Tianyu being one of them. However, she was often with a little girl who was around four or five years old.</p> <p>These memories were found to be incomplete as Lin Qiao sensed the scenes in her head. At last, the scene got fixed in a room. The little girl’s limbs were tied, and her mouth was taped, her black and shiny eyes filled with fear. The one who had tied her up was none other than Lu Tianyu herself.</p> <p>Lin Qiao finally remembered this now.</p> <p>Before this, many memories had flashed through her mind, all disjointed and from a long time ago. As for Lu Tianyu’s memories of the past six months, not too many of them had emerged in Lin Qiao’s mind.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hurried back, as she didn’t know whether that little girl was still alive or not! The girl had been locked up for three or four days by now, and Lin Qiao was worried that she might have had starved to death already!</p> <p>Thinking about this, Lin Qiao felt a deep contempt for Lu Tianyu. That woman was so selfish, unscrupulous, evil, and brutal that she had even hurt a child! She deserved to be bitten to death by zombies!</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the dark night, a zombie was running swiftly down the road in a baggy dress.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ran very fast because she was so worried about the child. However, the child’s location was too far from her current location. Her limbs weren’t as stiff as zombie limbs anymore, but still, they couldn’t allow her to run fast enough.</p> <p>As she was running, she realized that she didn’t feel tired at all! That was another benefit of being a zombie.</p> <p>Her heart had stopped beating. She didn’t breathe, and couldn’t feel anything when she was running. She ran and ran, but still felt nothing after running five miles, as if she was not the one who had ran all this while.</p> <p>However, she did feel waves of dull ache in her head during the run. She endured the pain while worrying about the child, with some images flashing across her mind from time to time.</p> <p>In those images, she saw a naked handsome man underneath her with red, raging eyes, strong chest muscles, and a snow-white skin like that of a girl. However, it was a man indeed…</p> <p>Another scene flashed across her mind, comprising of two men and a woman. It seemed they often carried out missions together, and all three of them had superpowers. The middle-aged man had lustful eyes, the woman looked frosty as ice, and the young man was fierce-looking.</p> <p>At last, the scene froze again. The fierce-looking man was facing Lu Tianyu with his fists clenched and the woman was throwing out sharp ice crystals that pierced her shoulders while the middle-aged man was talking coldly. Lu Tianyu screamed one last time just before she died.</p> <p>As she was recalling all of this, Lin Qiao wondered if this could be counted as karma. Lu Tuanyu had gotten many people killed before, and in the end, she was killed by her own teammates.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was a zombie, so nothing came out to stop her while she was running in the darkness. When running, she was also trying to piece the badly disjointed memories together in her head.</p> <p>To sum everything up, Lu Tianyu, this sl*tty woman, had her eyes on a man. In order to have this man, she kidnapped his five-year-old child and then raped him!</p> <p>Holy heavens! This woman actually did such a thing before she died! Why couldn’t she have raped a different man? Why did she have to rape a man who seemed to be so powerful!</p> <p>Lin Qiao was just speechless as she prayed for herself, <em>‘Please don’t let me run into that man. I’ll just send his child back in secret! But, I don’t even know whether the child is still alive or not! Damn it!’</em></p> <p>…</p> <p>When Lin Qiao was running desperately toward the city, a squadron of soldiers had been resting for two whole days inside the warehouse where Lu Tianyu was killed by Liu Hongshi and the others in the city.</p>",
  "Chapter 9: Enemy Suddenly Appeared": "<p>On the roof platform of the warehouse, a man who was over six feet tall and wearing camouflage military clothing stood on the edge, lifting his head and looking at the dark sky.</p> <p>At this time, another tall man in camouflage military clothing walked up. Turning his head to look around, he walked toward the man standing on the platform.</p> <p>“I knew you were here. I know you’re worried about Ling Ling, but you haven’t rested for days. You should go down and rest for a while. Don’t burn yourself out before you find her!” The tall man sighed and said.</p> <p>“Long, I don’t even know if Ling Ling is still alive! How can I possibly sleep? It was all my fault. I was careless, and I actually let that woman take Ling Ling away.” Wu Chengyue’s handsome face had a gloomy look on it. His beautiful eyes were bloodshot and filled with anxiety, regret, pain, as well as an extremely strong desire to kill.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong patted his shoulder and said, “Don’t worry! The seed that Yue planted in Ling Ling’s body isn’t dead, which means she is still alive. We will try harder to find her, and we will get her back for sure.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s expression changed as a stony murderous intent shrouded his face. The veins stood out on his forehead one after another as he said through gritted teeth, “I will kill that woman! If anything happens to Ling Ling, I will rip that woman to pieces!”</p> <p>In this apocalyptic world, horrors like rape and gang rape often happened to women. After all, women were too rare, and some men would always resort to taking women by force when they had no way to vent their desires. Besides, in this world, power was the absolute principle, as well as the only law of this world. People relied on their brute strength to speak for themselves here.</p> <p>However, he was raped by a woman…</p> <p>The more Wu Chengyue thought about this, the stronger his desire to kill became.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he didn’t know that the woman he wanted to rip to pieces had already been eaten by zombies, and that another soul had taken over her body, coming back to life as a zombie.</p> <p>“That woman won’t get far. As long as she is still in this city, we’ll find her,” said Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>At the same time, on the other side of the city, Lin Qiao was searching through the memories in her head while heading to the place where the little girl was hidden by the previous owner of the body.</p> <p>Soon, she came upon a dilapidated cold storage facility. She put her face against the door to feel what was inside, but could sense nothing.</p> <p>This cold storage was used for freezing meat. Due to the lack of electricity, it had been abandoned since the apocalyptic era began. However, this building was especially sturdy, such that those ordinary zombies wouldn’t be able to break through its thick iron door.</p> <p>Furthermore, it was airtight. The compartments inside had all been opened and the inner space was not small, but Lin Qiao was still worried that the little girl might have already died from suffocation. After all, many days had passed since the latter was hidden there.</p> <p>Standing in front of the cold storage, she looked at the door lock and knitted her zombie eyebrows together as she lowered her head and began to fumble in her own pockets. She went through all her pockets, but found no keys. So, how could she open the door?</p> <p>What should she do? She couldn’t open the door without keys!</p> <p>She became a little anxious as she made a few circles on the spot, ignoring the other zombies which were stumbling past.</p> <p>These zombies looked very scary at night, but once one got used to their looks, one would find that there was nothing to be afraid of, especially when they weren’t dangerous to oneself anymore.</p> <p>Lin Qiao made two circles, then looked at her dark claws, which held a cold luster, and back at the thick door. She wondered if she could force it open with her claws. Would she break her claws against the door?</p> <p>No average person could open this door without a key, but, she wasn’t an average person anymore, was she?</p> <p>She raised her hand and tried to insert the tips of her claws into the thin door slit, but they wouldn’t fit!</p> <p>She scratched and scratched, twisting her fingers… Finally, she managed to catch the door seam with her claws, but was unable to put forth her strength.</p> <p>After struggling for a while, she squatted on the ground, fretfully scratching her head with her claws in frustration.</p> <p>What could she do? She couldn’t open the door, and the building didn’t have windows or any other openings.</p> <p>Right at that moment, she suddenly sensed a message within her head.</p> <p>“Here, this way! We must find the child before they do!”</p> <p>This was a clear message, and its goal was definitive.</p> <p><em>‘People are coming!’ </em>Lin Qiao immediately stood up and darted into a dark room through an open door on the side, hiding in there.</p> <p>Soon, she heard some voices.</p> <p>“Has that woman been here?”</p> <p>“I happened to see her walking this way. I can’t say for sure if she has hidden the kid here or not.”</p> <p>“We’ve searched through so many places. Where the hell did the b*tch hide the child?”</p> <p>“Has she killed the child?”</p> <p>“No! I have received a message which said that the kid is not dead yet. Can’t you see Wu Chengyue is still trying to find her?”</p> <p>“But…”</p> <p>“No ‘buts’. Let’s first find out if any place in this area could hide a person.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao hid in the darkness while staring at the three people with her dark eyes, which bore no resemblance to the eyes of normal people.</p> <p>It was them, the three superpowered people who had gotten Lu Tianyu killed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched the three people dodge the zombies which had been constantly approaching them. Meanwhile, they appeared to be looking for something.</p> <p>She didn’t expect that these people would want the little girl as well, and she had no way to find out what they needed the little girl for. These three didn’t look like good people anyway.</p> <p>They made her feel unsafe. She knew that any one of them was stronger than her, and that she would have no chance of beating any of them. That was the reason why she had hidden so quietly.</p> <p>She watched the three get closer and closer to the cold storage where the kid was locked.</p> <p>“Eh? This is a cold storage unit!” Liang Caiyan said while pointing at the cold storage that Lin Qiao had been standing in front of moments before.</p> <p>With his eyes flashing, Lin Yong said, “This cold storage unit is perfect for hiding people. Zombies can’t break in.”</p> <p>“Could that woman have hidden the child here?” Liu Hongshi asked.</p> <p>The three exchanged a look, feeling that it was highly probable.</p> <p>“Let’s get in there and find out,” said Lin Yong.</p> <p>As he was speaking, he raised his palm, and a tongue of flame shot out of it a second later. He then turned his palm around and pressed the flame onto the door lock area.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched them quietly. The two relatively younger people stood with their backs to the door of the cold storage, facing the zombies outside. They killed every zombie that approached them in order to stop the other zombies from doing the same. Meanwhile, the middle-aged man behind them was doing something to the door lock.</p> <p>A whole ten minutes had passed by. As these three people lingered in the area, they began to attract more and more zombies, which were now crowding toward them.</p> <p>“Roar… Roar… Roar… Roar…” The zombies bared their teeth and wielded their claws as they pounced on the three, but ended up either being stabbed by Liang Caiyan’s sharp ice crystals, or having their heads blown off by Liu Hongshi’s steel cudgel.</p> <p>However, as more and more zombies gathered in the area, the two gradually became overwhelmed. Just as they couldn’t help but intend to ask Lin Yong if it was done, the latter took a step backward.</p> <p>On the thick door before him, the door lock was twisted and bent out of shape oddly, as if it had been melted at a high temperature.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Lin Yong aimed and smashed a heavy punch at the twisted door lock. With that, the door cracked and a slit appeared.</p> <p>Lin Qiao cursed silently in her head on seeing that the three had opened the door. She couldn’t let them take the child, because she had felt their evil intentions toward the child. The child might even die at their hands.</p> <p>However, she was no match for them at the moment. What could she do?</p> <p>Looking at the zombies that had surrounded the door of the cold storage, she suddenly had only one thought in her mind.</p> <p>If only these zombies would charge savagely at the three! <em>‘Charge! All charge!’</em>she shouted in her head.</p>",
  "Chapter 10: Riotous Zombies": "<p>Lin Qiao failed to notice that as soon as she had this thought, the crowd of zombies became agitated, transitioning from moving stiffly to rushing forward crazily with an agile speed. They opened their mouth wide, baring their teeth and extending their hands in front while fiercely swarming forward.</p> <p>The surrounding zombies which had been slowly approaching all thrust their feet against the ground and rushed at the three like crazy.</p> <p>“What happened? Why are these zombies going crazy all of a sudden?” The two who had been defending the group were already busy warding off the increasing number of the zombies, when all the zombies on the scene suddenly went mad, violently pouncing on them.</p> <p>The two were immediately overwhelmed and their defense instantly fell apart as they quickly lost their advantage.</p> <p>Lin Yong had sensed the abnormal movements of the zombies once he broke the door lock. Before he pushed the door open, he turned around to check the situation behind him. At that instant, all he saw was the mad expressions of the surrounding zombies, startling him greatly. He then hurriedly turned around to launch attacks and defend against the approaching zombies.</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened her zombie eyes wide, feeling a little strange when watching the changes happening outside.</p> <p>Why were these zombies suddenly going mad?</p> <p>However, as she watched the trio being attacked by more and more zombies, an idea flashed across her mind. She walked out of the dark room, joined the group of zombies, and rushed at the trio.</p> <p>At first, there were barely two-hundred zombies in this area, but for some unknown reason, endless zombies suddenly showed up nearby. Baring their claws and teeth, they all charged at the three with abandon while their number kept increasing steadily.</p> <p>“What happened? What has happened? Why are these zombies rioting?” Lin Yong asked in confusion while wielding his arms and sending out streaks of flame to singe the zombies which were pouncing on him.</p> <p>Liu Hongshi was getting anxious as well. Facing more and more zombies, a layer of sweat oozed out of his face. “I don’t know! They suddenly went mad,” he yelled back.</p> <p>The three tried their best to defend themselves against the zombies, but none of their superpowers were high-leveled. As the number of zombies increased, it got more and more difficult to repel them.</p> <p>At last, Liu Hongshi said a little fretfully, “It’s not working. There’re more and more zombies coming. We’re going to get exhausted. Let’s leave for now. If this continues, we’ll be surrounded and eaten by zombies eventually.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao had already quickly made her way around the wall from the edge of the zombie mob.</p> <p>She saw that the three had no choice but to give up on the cold storage as more and more zombies approached them. They fought their way through the zombie mob and left the area temporarily.</p> <p>With that, the zombie crowd also followed them away from the door of the cold storage.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the door and raised a claw to push it.</p> <p>The two lingering zombies near the door turned back their heads after Lin Qiao pushed the door open, oddly staring at the door before Lin Qiao’s face with their pale gray eyes, as though something had attracted them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s nose was many times more sensitive than the noses of these average brainless zombies. Therefore, she had sensed a tempting aroma quite a while ago.</p> <p>She felt that the zombies around her wanted to approach the door as well.</p> <p>“Roar!” Lin Qiao growled angrily at them as a strong spiritual force was sent from her mind to repel these zombies.</p> <p>“Roar… Roar… Ow-whoo…” After being forced back by her growls, the surrounding zombies turned around immediately and limped away.</p> <p>Having seen the situation, Lin Qiao paused briefly. She didn’t give these zombies another thought as she just wanted to check on the child.</p> <p>As soon as she caught the aroma, she had the confirmation that there was a living person inside, even though the aroma was very faint.</p> <p>She pushed the door open, walked inside, and then closed the door behind her. The cold storage was so dark on the inside that ordinary people wouldn’t be able to see their own hands in front of their faces. However, Lin Qiao could clearly see everything in this place.</p> <p>This cold storage unit had many compartments. She followed the aroma to one compartment, and as she had expected, she spotted something in a corner.</p> <p>Hurriedly making her way to the corner, she smelt this faint aroma that made her feel hungry and also made her desire to eat raw meat resurge.</p> <p>She wanted to eat! She wanted to eat meat, to drink blood!</p> <p>These thoughts muddled her brain for a second, but she soon realized what had happened.</p> <p>While suppressing her hunger with her willpower, she moved to the corner and squatted down, gently pulling away the blanket which had something wrapped in it using her nails.</p> <p>The blanket was unwrapped, exposing an adorable face. The pair of eyes were closed tightly, and the lips were parched.</p> <p>Lin Qiao lifted the child up, spreading her fingers with her long and sharp nails and gently stroking the child’s face.</p> <p>As a zombie, she had no body temperature, but she could still feel the temperature of other things, such as the warmth of this kid’s skin.</p> <p>On touching the child, Lin Qiao felt that the former’s body temperature was a little low. Her teeth were clenched, eyes tightly closed, and her breath was shallow. Lin Qiao lowered her head and put her ear against the child’s chest, finding that her heartbeat was very slow.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that the child was dying, and she couldn’t possibly leave her here.</p> <p>She thus held up the child and hurried out of the cold storage.</p> <p>Judging by the child’s parched lips, Lin Qiao surmised that she hadn’t eaten or drunk for a few days. An adult would be dead after three days without water, let alone a five-year-old child.</p> <p>But miraculously, this child in Lin Qiao’s arms was still alive, although at her last breaths.</p> <p>From Lu Tianyu’s memories, Lin Qiao learned who this child was, and that she actually had a superpower as well. However, her power wasn’t strong enough yet, and she hadn’t learned to control it or use it to attack.</p> <p>Nevertheless, her instinctive desire for survival allowed her power to firmly protect her life-force, which was why she was still alive after days without food and water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao carried the child outside, but she was at a loss without knowing what to do. The child was unwell, and would die unless she was given some food and water soon.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked around, finding nothing but ruins. How could any water possibly be found here?</p> <p>Suddenly, she thought of the small, clear lake in her mysterious space. She looked at the child in her arms, then abruptly raised her head and growled again.</p> <p>“Roarrrr!”</p> <p><em>‘Back off!’ </em>she said.</p> <p>The growl was meant for the surrounding zombies who were attempting to approach them bit by bit. On hearing her threatening roar, these zombies retreated immediately.</p> <p>Lin Qiao held the child and concentrated, then firmly said a single word in her heart.</p> <p><em>‘In!’</em></p> <p>As a bright light flashed across her eyes, the dark, abandoned street before her eyes changed into a lush green grassland, although the light in this place was a little dim and misty right now.</p> <p>She quickly carried the child to the lakeside and laid her down on the ground. After that, she glanced at the grass near the lake and found an extra wide and long blade, plucking it out.</p> <p>Next, she rolled the grass blade into a funnel, with which, she scooped some water from the lake and put it gently by the child’s tightly closed mouth. Then, she clasped the child’s jaw and gently pinched it with her other hand.</p> <p>Consequently, the child’s mouth was opened, and she poured the water gently into it.</p> <p>She knew that this five-year-old child was called Ling Ling, and that she was that man’s daughter.</p>",
  "Chapter 11: Controlled Zombies": "<p>The water trickled into Ling Ling’s mouth. At first, it kept spilling out, but after Lin Qiao tried a few more times, her subconscious seemed to wake up and she slowly began to swallow the water.</p> <p>As the child had finally drunk some water, Lin Qiao exhaled a breath of relief that she had been holding in all this time.</p> <p>The child took a few more sips, after which Lin Qiao couldn’t make her drink any more water. She threw away the grass leaf, picked up the child, and walked away. Finding a dry spot on the grass, she laid the girl down along with the blanket.</p> <p>After setting the child down, she put her palm on her chest to feel her heartbeat. The child’s heartbeat was still very weak, but stable nevertheless, and without the frightening irregularity that she had felt before.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought about what to do and decided that the best course of action was to send this child back to her father. She thought of it as making amends for the bad things done by the former owner of her body. It was dangerous and inconvenient for the child to be with her anyway.</p> <p>As a zombie, she had an instinctive hunger deep down for living human beings, so she worried that she might lose control someday and eat this child.</p> <p>As the child had been found, she now needed to find the group of people and send the child back secretly without alerting them.</p> <p>It seemed to be quite simple, but the problem was that she was a zombie, and those people would attack her as soon as she approached them. Fortunately, she now looked nothing like that woman with heavy makeup. Otherwise, every single one of those people would try to kill her on sight, wouldn’t they?</p> <p>Just as Lin Qiao prepared to leave her space and try finding the child’s father, the child, who had her eyes closed and had been asleep the whole time, twitched her eyelids slightly and then slowly opened them without any warning.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was busy preparing to leave and didn’t notice that the child had woken up.</p> <p>“Ahhhhhh!” All of a sudden, a high-pitched scream gave Lin Qiao one hell of a scare, making her jump. All the fine hairs on her body stood straight up as she bared her teeth and leaped to her feet like a startled cat, looking at the source of this scream with her face alert and filled with fear.</p> <p>She saw the child already sitting up while looking at her with a face that was a picture of fear, and bright eyes that were filled with panic.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>On the other side, Wuyue Ling’s had a confused look in her eyes when she saw Lin Qiao react that way.</p> <p>However, in the next second, she suddenly realized that this creature standing in front of her was a zombie, a human-eating monster. Her dad had told her that these monsters liked to eat human beings, especially children!!!</p> <p>Wu Yueling became horrified right away, fixing her wide-open eyes on Lin Qiao. She wanted to scream and cry, but she hadn’t noticed that she couldn’t utter a single sound anymore, and her body had become uncontrollably stiff.</p> <p>‘She’ll eat me! She’ll definitely eat me!’ she screamed in her head.</p> <p>Once Lin Qiao recovered from her own scare, she patted her chest with her claws to calm herself without realizing that, in fact, she no longer had a heart.</p> <p>‘She scared the life out of me! This little kid almost gave me a heart attack… My god!’</p> <p>After patting her chest a few times, Lin Qiao suddenly thought of something.</p> <p>‘Damn it! Damn it! I’m a zombie! How could a child possibly scare the life out of me!’</p> <p>She raised up her head and looked at the child. The girl was staring back at her with two big wide-open eyes. Her body was stiffened, and pupils were shrinking and dilating. Lin Qiao felt that the girl would pass out immediately if she got any closer. However, before this thought had even faded from her mind, the little girl trembled by the sight of her face which was covered with wounds, then fell on the ground with her eyes rolling back.</p> <p>‘See? My face has scared her senseless… Wait, is my face really so scary?’ Lin Qiao wondered.</p> <p>She walked over to check on the child and found that her whole face had taken on a bluish tint. Apparently, she had been scared quite badly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao placed the child’s body into a comfortable position, letting her sleep comfortably in the blanket.</p> <p>Then, she stood up and turned around while saying one word silently.</p> <p>‘Out’.</p> <p>A bright flash appeared before her eyes. When she could finally see again, she found herself out of the space as expected, standing in the same spot where she had entered the space from.</p> <p>She looked at the scattered zombies around her and realized that they could somehow understand her orders. She had also been faintly sensing these zombies’ thoughts, which were comprising of just one phrase—’So hungry!’</p> <p>She too was incredibly hungry, more so than ever as she had been staying with the little girl the whole time. Smelling the girl’s enticing aroma made her want to bite the little thing so badly.</p> <p>Beyond that, she was a little confused when she thought about the rioting of zombies that happened earlier.</p> <p>At the time, she was just thinking that if only those zombies would all rush at the three, she would have a chance to lose herself in the crowd. What she didn’t expect was that the zombie mob really would charge at the three. She didn’t know for sure if they heard and understood her order, and yet, the fact that more and more zombies were attracted to that area seemed to suggest that they did.</p> <p>She turned to a wandering zombie near her, fixed her eyes on it, and murmured silently, ‘Look at me… Look at me… Look at me…’</p> <p>As expected, the male zombie that Lin Qiao was staring at stopped shuffling forward, slowly turned his head back to look at her, then turned his entire body around as his gray, half rolled up eyes stared at her in confusion.</p> <p>‘Walk over…’ Lin Qiao kept staring at him and said silently.</p> <p>Next thing she knew, the zombie began swaying toward her.</p> <p>When that happened, Lin Qiao was truly shocked because the male zombie was really able to sense her thoughts and follow her orders. Had she evolved into a high-level zombie already? Was that why she was able to control these unintelligent zombies?</p> <p>As she was thinking about this, the male zombie had swayed to where she was, then stopped and looked at her with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him, then waved him off.</p> <p>‘Go away.’</p> <p>After receiving her command, the male zombie turned around and left, still confused.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then performed the same test on another zombie and got the same result. She was now certain that she had been upgraded, although she didn’t know how many levels she had risen, neither was she clear about the zombie ranking system.</p> <p>After confirming that she was able to control other zombies, she turned around without further deliberations and searched through Lu Tianyu’s memories for the location of the building in which she had raped the man.</p> <p>After confirming the direction, she promptly headed that way.</p> <p>She didn’t know if the man would still be there, but she believed that he would be nearby. He must be searching for his daughter near that area for sure.</p> <p>It was night time now, perfect for her activities.</p> <p>She ran in that direction like a nimble shadow in the darkness of the night. She ran quite fast, but still didn’t feel tired at all. Two hours later, she came to the front of that building, but didn’t detect any human vibes or see any humans.</p> <p>She stood in an obscure corner and called a zombie over, trying to communicate mentally with it.</p> <p>‘Are there human beings in this place?’ she asked silently.</p> <p>The zombie looked at her with confusion, failing to comprehend her meaning, and seeming to have completely no idea what she was talking about.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p><em>‘Human beings?’ </em>Lin Qiao asked which ended up emitting out in the form of a growl.</p> <p>The zombie continued looking at her confusedly, giving absolutely no response.</p> <p>“Roarrrr?”</p> <p><em>‘Have you seen any human being?’ </em>she asked again.</p> <p>The zombie couldn’t look any more confused at this point.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was speechless, having no idea how to proceed forward from this point.</p>",
  "Chapter 12: Communication Between Zombies": "<p>Lin Qiao continued to roar at the zombie for a while without receiving the slightest response or reaction from the latter. She felt like she was talking to a cow, which could understand rudimentary instructions but not answer any questions.</p> <p>She had no way of communicating with this zombie at all.</p> <p>Understanding this, she sighed and gave up on asking it for directions.</p> <p><em>‘Hungry…’</em></p> <p>Suddenly, a thought popped up in Lin Qiao’s mind, seeming to come from someone other than herself.</p> <p><em>‘Hungry… Hungry… Hungry…’</em></p> <p>Her head ached slightly, as she felt similar to when she first woke up and found that she was processing a lot of information composed of thoughts belonging to someone other than herself. She remembered passing out from the pain due to such a huge amount of information flooding into her brain yesterday or the day before. But now, she merely received a small amount of information that wasn’t as strong as what she had sensed earlier, and the headache was faint as well.</p> <p>She lifted her head and looked around. <em>‘Who is crying out that they’re hungry?’</em>She wondered.</p> <p><em>‘Hungry… Hungry…’</em></p> <p>Just then, the thought emerged again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed it, and could hear it shouting ‘hungry’. Suddenly she realized that this thought was from no one else but the zombie right in front of her.</p> <p>“Roar”, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but roar at the zombie.</p> <p><em>‘Are you hungry?’ </em>she asked.</p> <p>The zombie only looked at her in confusion, then roared back at her, “Roar.”</p> <p><em>‘Hungry.’ </em>The zombie replied.</p> <p>“Roar”, Lin Qiao tried again to ask him, <em>‘Is there any human in this place?’</em></p> <p>This time, the zombie didn’t reply, but simply continued to look at her blankly just like before.</p> <p>She sighed and waved a hand at the zombie, signaling it to leave. At this moment, the zombie showed quick reflexes and left immediately.</p> <p>Lin Qiao kept looking around, thinking that she should maybe explore this place to see if she could find those people. However, as she was preparing to go, a voice suddenly burst into loud cries inside her head, startling her.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Where is this cry coming from?’</em></p> <p>She fretfully looked left and right, then front and behind, but couldn’t see anyone or sense any child crying in the vicinity.</p> <p>Wahhhhh… Wooooo…</p> <p>Another wave of the child’s cries was heard, still ringing inside her mind. This time, Lin Qiao changed her expression slightly and immediately said ‘in’ silently in her head.</p> <p>In the next moment, she disappeared from the obscure corner where she had been hiding.</p> <p>As soon as Lin Qiao entered the space, the crying in her head instantly turned into actual crying sounds.</p> <p>“Whooo… Wahhhh… Wooooo!” The child sitting on the blanket was crying on finding herself all alone in a strange place after waking up, due to which she was terrified. After she cried for a short while, a horrible-looking zombie suddenly appeared right before her eyes, which frightened her and made her shut up at once.</p> <p>The moment she saw Lin Qiao, she opened her eyes wide, staring at the latter in terror. Her body stiffened so badly that she even began to tremble.</p> <p>She wanted to cry, but couldn’t open her mouth or make any sound emerge from her throat. Gripped by pure terror, she watched this zombie whom she had seen once before walking toward her.</p> <p><em>‘She’s coming over to eat me! She’s gonna eat me! I’m going to be eaten!’ </em>The little girl was scared to death, but at least she didn’t pass out again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was lured by Wu Yueling’s aroma and couldn’t help drooling, but at the same time, she was also reading the latter’s mind. She saw that Wu Yueling was staring at her in horror with her lips pressed together and body stiff, not daring to move at all.</p> <p>Lin Qiao tried moving her foot, but saw a tremor run through Wu Yueling’s body the moment she did. Wu Yueling then quickly curled herself up, wrapped her arms around her knees, and hung her head.</p> <p><em>‘Daddy! I’m gonna be eaten! Daddy! Please come to save me! Daddy…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao had to take a small step backward when she heard the little girl screaming in her own head. She thought for a while, then turned around and left the space.</p> <p>Quite a while later, Wu Yueling realized that she seemed to be fine. Why hadn’t the zombie bitten her yet? She slowly raised her head with surprise but saw nothing in the spot where the zombie had been standing.</p> <p>Wu Yueling had been given quite a fright. She hurriedly looked around, but still couldn’t find the zombie.</p> <p><em>‘Where is the zombie? Where did it go? It was standing right there, preparing to eat me.’</em></p> <p>She looked to her left and then to her right, but found no zombie. After that, she sighed slightly in relief. And before long, she pouted, her mouth curved downward as she struggled not to cry again.</p> <p><em>‘There is no one here! It’s so scary! Where is my daddy? Why didn’t he come to find me? I want my daddy! Daddy…’</em></p> <p>After leaving her space, Lin Qiao stood quietly while looking at the sky. She didn’t know what the time was because she didn’t have a watch, but judging from the starlight, it should be around three or four o’clock in the morning.</p> <p>She looked around, suddenly noticing a very tall building. Her black eyes shone as she turned around and quietly ran toward the building’s gate under the cover of darkness. She moved as quietly as a cat which had stood up on its rear tires. Only her clothes made some slight noise while fluttering in the air.</p> <p>This building had thirty to forty floors. As there was no elevator, her only choice was to climb the stairs.</p> <p>The surrounding zombies all stepped away from her or turned around to avoid looking at her once she approached them.</p> <p>Ordinary zombies couldn’t climb stairs because their knee joints were too stiff. Only zombies which had evolved to level-one or above were able to walk and run nimbly, capable of going up and down the stairs like Lin Qiao was doing now.</p> <p>The evolutionary process of zombies was slow. The unintelligent zombies could only find food by relying on their instinctive hunger, and only a small number of evolved zombies fared slightly better than that. Due to this, Lin Qiao hadn’t seen any of the higher-level zombies in Lu Tianyu’s memories until this moment.</p> <p>At level one and two, the zombies were still unintelligent. They were merely a group of nimble and swift monsters whose only awareness was their desire to eat human beings.</p> <p>Only at levels three or above would zombies with intelligence emerge.</p> <p>To evolve to level one or two, ordinary zombies needed to consume a great amount of blood and flesh of ordinary human beings, or some blood and flesh of superpowered human beings. After that, the evolvement from level two to three was even more difficult.</p> <p>Not even one in a hundred level-two zombies could evolve to level three.</p> <p>However, as soon as Lin Qiao opened her eyes, she had directly evolved to level-three from an ordinary zombie. She even had almost reached level-four, in fact!</p> <p>She had memories and a soul, and of course, she had her intelligence.</p> <p>However, she still didn’t like climbing floors, even though she had become a zombie. She felt dizzy while climbing the stairs floor by floor, despite the fact that she couldn’t feel tired or be out of breath, or that her heart was going to explode like a living human being’s would by now.</p> <p>She felt dizzy! Dizzy!</p> <p>After climbing a dozen floors, she even felt tight in the chest.</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! Am I not a zombie? How can I possibly feel dizzy and chest tightness? Can’t I even live happily as a zombie?’</em></p> <p>She stopped on the twentieth floor, walking to the window around the side while complaining to herself.</p> <p>This was already the twentieth floor, and this height should allow her to see the things present in the area.</p>",
  "Chapter 13: The Scent in the Air": "<p>Lin Qiao walked to a window beside the stairs in the building and looked outside. In the eyes of ordinary humans, there was only darkness outside. The buildings, plants, and all the other things on the ground were just shades and shadows in the dim light.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao could see everything clearly. Zombies weren’t able to see colors, but Lin Qiao’s eyes were slightly different from those of ordinary zombies.</p> <p>Her eyes were even darker than the shades of night. She opened those eyes wide and swept her gaze across the area which could be seen from the window. However, even after searching for a while, she detected not a single light. She guessed that those people were being careful not to draw attention to themselves.</p> <p>After observing things for a little longer and still seeing nothing, her eyes sparkled as she changed her way of searching.</p> <p>She lifted her chin slightly, closed her eyes, and carefully sniffed the air again and again.</p> <p>She had come to realize that her sense of smell was now even sharper than that of dogs. As she had hoped, after spending a while sniffing the scent in the winds around the tall buildings, she sensed something special.</p> <p>Among all the scents she detected, the strongest was the rancid stench from zombie bodies. She also detected some strange scents from plantlife and mutated animals, but those were faint, diluted by other scents in the air.</p> <p>By now, she could tell the smells apart, especially those of living people and zombies. However, she didn’t yet know the reach of her sense of smell.</p> <p>She sniffed for quite a while in this tall building, detecting all kinds of smells but finding none which belonged to living human beings.</p> <p>She didn’t want to give up, so she walked about aimlessly on this floor, then ran in the other direction and found another window. She removed the window pane, then stuck her head out, and sniffed as hard as she could.</p> <p>But still, she detected no trace of living human beings while standing in this building.</p> <p>She found this a little perplexing. Wouldn’t that man send his people out to look for his daughter? Why couldn’t she detect any live human being in this area?</p> <p>Should she keep the little one if she failed to find her family?</p> <p>Lin Qiao struggled a little with this thought.</p> <p>She was a zombie now, and no matter how hungry she felt, she couldn’t seem to die. But unlike her, the little one in her space was a living human being, a five-year-old child. A human being needed to eat, especially a child. If she were not careful, the child could get sick, and that would be troublesome.</p> <p>Thinking of the little one, Lin Qiao suddenly realized that she hadn’t been sensing anything from her for some time now, and could no longer hear her cries. What if the child had had an accident? This thought flashed across Lin Qiao’s mind, and she hurriedly re-entered her space.</p> <p>A bright light flashed across her eyes and then she showed up in the space, which was still misty and had no sounds disturbing the silence.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s eyes swept across the area and found Wu Yueling’s tiny body curled up on the ground, wrapped in the small blanket.</p> <p>Her heart sank as she hurried over. Suppressing her urge to eat the child, she squatted down to observe the color on the girl’s face. Her face was very pale, as were her lips, and the rims of her eyes were dark and bluish.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to reach out and touch the girl’s forehead, but the sight of her black and shiny nails made her pause.</p> <p>Zombies’ teeth and nails all carried the zombie virus, and the virus on her dark and sharp nails must be more potent than that of ordinary zombies.</p> <p>She couldn’t directly touch the child’s skin with these nails! Therefore, she wondered if she was able to somehow retract her nails.</p> <p>She looked at her fingernails and thought about retracting them, causing a strange feeling to arise in her finger bones. She then fixed her eyes on her nails and actually saw them slowly turning white and becoming shorter. Next, she watched the sharp nails disappear from her fingers and look like the nails of ordinary humans.</p> <p>She looked at her fingers with confusion, then raised her other hand. The fingernails on her other hand were still black and sharp.</p> <p>Could…her fingernails change according to her thoughts?</p> <p>She thought about this with a degree of uncertainty, then pointed at her unchanged hand, staring at her fingertips as she whispered silently in her heart.</p> <p><em>‘Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!’</em></p> <p>As expected, her other hand slowly started looking like a hand of an ordinary human while her dark fingernails disappeared.</p> <p>After watching her fingernails change, she remained silent for a while, then tentatively touched the child’s forehead with her fingers.</p> <p>The child’s skin was cold, much colder than the normal body temperature of healthy humans.</p> <p>Lin Qiao frowned slightly and immediately withdrew her hand.</p> <p>She didn’t know if the child had been awakened by the coldness of her fingers, but after she withdrew her hand, the child’s eyelids suddenly twitched and then slowly opened.</p> <p><em>‘This isn’t good!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao’s heart skipped a beat. She shouted silently in her head and then hurriedly stood up to step aside, darting five meters away from the child while looking nervously back at her.</p> <p>That had been a completely instinctive reaction of Lin Qiao because earlier on, the child burst into screams and almost fainted on seeing her. Just now, the girl suddenly opened her eyes once again, and if she saw that Lin Qiao was standing right beside her, she would be scared to death, wouldn’t she?</p> <p>The child turned her head and began to look around blankly. And as Lin Qiao had thought, the girl became fully awake the moment she saw her. Her large, watery, but somehow lusterless eyes were fixed onto Lin Qiao’s face and grew even wider with fear.</p> <p>But this time, she didn’t scream, and just bit her lips tightly while staring at Lin Qiao without blinking.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was standing five meters away as she looked helplessly back at the girl. She had always been hopeless with children. Children at this age were the most ignorant, self-willed, and naughty creatures in the world, the hardest ones to pacify. To make matters worse, their cries were shrill to the point of being deafening!</p> <p>A wailing child was at the top of the list of the things that she couldn’t stand.</p> <p><em>‘She’s here! She’s back! She’s here to eat me… This zombie is gonna eat me… Wooo… Daddy! Daddy! Where are you? Come and save me! Come and save Ling Ling! Why won’t you come to save Ling Ling?’</em></p> <p>Just as Lin Qiao was reaching a despairing level of indecision, she suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of fear, desperation, panic, and other negative emotions. At the same time, she was able to read the mind behind it.</p> <p>These were clearly the child’s current feelings.</p> <p>But soon, these feelings became weaker and weaker.</p> <p><em>‘I’m gonna die… Daddy… I’m gonna be eaten… Daddy…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Daddy… Daddy…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Daddy…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was startled and dismayed to notice that the light in the child’s eyes was dimming.</p> <p><em>‘What should I do? What should I do?’ </em>Lin Qiao was becoming anxious, almost scratching her head in her frustration. She had already felt that the child was losing the desire to survive, truly believing that she would be eaten.</p> <p>If Lin Qiao left the space now, there was a chance that the child might recover a little. However, that wasn’t a permanent solution. The child hadn’t eaten for days, which had resulted in her body beginning to fail. Now that she had lost her desire to survive, that would only speed up the failure of her body.</p>",
  "Chapter 14: Silent Communication": "<p>Lin Qiao was stiff with worry. She didn’t know what to do, but she knew that she shouldn’t approach the child right now. All she could do was move two steps backward and try making the child react.</p> <p>What she really wanted was to carry the child to the lake and get her to drink some more water.</p> <p>She had taken a bath in that lake earlier on, and didn’t know if the virus in her body had infected the water or not. However, she remembered that the child had drunk a tiny bit of lake water when she first came in, and no adverse effects seemed to have appeared so far. This proved that the water was safe.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao stepped back, Wu Yueling’s eyes suddenly sparkled. Surprisingly, those dull eyes of hers began brightening, and the fear and desperation in them seemed to be magically fading away, albeit marginally so. Then, she looked at Lin Qiao with curiosity.</p> <p>Children could actually be very sensitive. When she saw Lin Qiao’s horrible zombie face just now, her first response was fear. However, this wasn’t the first time she had seen the latter, and was actually the second or even the third time.</p> <p>She was scared, but when she saw Lin Qiao step backward, she was suddenly reminded of a question. Why hadn’t this zombie bitten her yet?</p> <p>Although Wu Yueling was very young, she had seen zombies before, which had left her with psychological scars that were the root of her current psychological problems.</p> <p>In her memories, zombies were terrifying, and would savagely pounce and bite anyone they saw.</p> <p>Why hadn’t this zombie pounced on her? Why was this zombie standing so far away from her, as though she was too scared to approach?</p> <p>Thinking about this suddenly set off an internal struggle inside Wu Yueling’s little head. For a moment, she found that she actually wasn’t as scared as she had been before.</p> <p>She also recalled that the last time she saw this zombie, it had jumped away from her, as though it were startled by her screams.</p> <p>Wu Yueling pictured the startled Lin Qiao whose hairs were standing nearly straight up on her head.</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao was carefully observing Wu Yueling’s every move. She had noticed the change of expression on the latter’s face, and at the same time, she also had a faint sense that this child’s fear and despair had abated slightly, replaced by curiosity instead.</p> <p><em>‘The psychology of children is strange indeed!’ </em>Lin Qiao thought. But in the meantime, she silently sighed in relief as well. Now that the little one wasn’t as afraid of her, other things should be much easier.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao was reading Wu Yueling’s mind, she suddenly had an idea.</p> <p>She was able to control zombies and read their minds, so… could she convey her own thoughts to others as well? Could she let this little one know what she had been thinking? If she could…</p> <p>Once she thought of this possibility, Lin Qiao felt her heart beating faster, even though she knew that this was an illusion as her heart wasn’t beating at all. She didn’t have any heartbeat at all!</p> <p>Thinking of this, Lin Qiao decided on immediate action. She looked at Wu Yueling in the eyes, then suddenly sat cross-legged on the ground while facing her confused gaze. After that, the two of them just stared at each other.</p> <p><em>‘What is she doing? Isn’t she coming over to bite me? Isn’t she going to eat me?’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling’s sense of danger gradually faded, and she became more and more curious. When she saw that Lin Qiao made no attempt to approach her and simply sat on the ground, these thoughts instantly popped up in her mind.</p> <p>And of course, Lin Qiao could sense her thoughts.</p> <p>Children who were only a few years old were barely able to keep their thoughts hidden. In fact, Wu Yueling’s thoughts played like a movie across her face.</p> <p>The two gazed at each other for a while, after which, Lin Qiao lifted her hand slightly and waved at Yueling, as though greeting her.</p> <p>Wu Yueling sat in front of Lin Qiao, wondered what she was doing. She was obviously quite confused by the latter’s action.</p> <p>She blinked her eyes and then moved her body, finally feeling that lying like this was very uncomfortable. So, she supported her body with her arms and slowly sat up while looking at Lin Qiao alertly.</p> <p>“Hrr? Hrr?” Lin Qiao produced a low, gravelly sound from her throat in a bid to try and talk to Wu Yueling.</p> <p><em>‘Ling Ling? Ling Ling?’</em></p> <p>She concentrated her thoughts and called Wu Yueling both out loud and in her heart. However, her tongue was stiff being a zombie, which made her voice sound weird like ‘hrr, hrr’.</p> <p>Wu Yueling couldn’t do anything but look back at her with a confused expression on her face</p> <p>Lin Qiao tried a few more times, but Wu Yueling had only been looking at her, feeling strange without showing any change of expression.</p> <p>After a while, Lin Qiao sighed with disappointment.</p> <p>On hearing this sigh, the expression in Wu Yueling’s eyes slightly changed. However, this was unnoticed by Lin Qiao, who had turned around to look at the lake.</p> <p>Since she had failed to communicate by using her thoughts, she thought she would try with actions.</p> <p>After glancing at the lake, Lin Qiao had a sudden inspiration, and then she slowly stood up.</p> <p>Seeing her stand up, Wu Yueling became nervous again. But next, she soon realized that this zombie wasn’t coming near her.</p> <p><em>‘What is she doing?’ </em>Wu Yueling wondered curiously as she watched Lin Qiao walk to the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao reached the lakeside, plucked a few long grass leaves, then deftly wove them into a small, green dragonfly. She subsequently put the dragonfly down, picked up a few more leaves, and made a small funnel with them. Next, she pinched the edge of the funnel, put it into the lake, and scooped up some water.</p> <p>The lake water was as clear as before. It poured into the funnel woven by Lin Qiao, and she was delighted that it didn’t leak out.</p> <p>Lin Qiao held the water-filled funnel in one hand and the grass dragonfly in the other, then slowly walked back to Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was watching Lin Qiao with wide-eyed curiosity, as she wanted to know what the latter had been doing by the lake. However, when she saw Lin Qiao suddenly stand up and walk toward her, she was startled and instinctively drew back.</p> <p>Seeing her reaction, Lin Qiao immediately stopped walking and stood still. Moving no other part of her body except for her arms, she slowly extended the things in her hands forward.</p> <p>As she had hoped, the little one was instantly attracted by the grass dragonfly and funnel in her hands. For some reason, children were always interested in straw-woven toys like these.</p> <p>Lin Qiao lived in the countryside as a child, and her grandpa had taught her how to make grass dragonflies like this one. She had never imagined that she would be using this to cheer up a child one day.</p> <p>She showed Wu Yueling the grass dragonfly and was gratified to see that the repulsion she had seen in Wu Yueling’s eyes was now gone. After that, she raised her foot and took two more steps toward Wu Yueling.</p> <p>She caught the child’s attention once she moved, but this time, the child didn’t seem to be as nervous as before. Wu Yueling just looked at Lin Qiao in the eye and then switched her attention to the dragonfly in her hand.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took the child’s reaction as permission to proceed. So, she lifted her foot again and slowly walked toward the little girl.</p> <p>The little girl watched her warily and nervously, but couldn’t help glancing at the grass dragonfly in her hand.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slowly moved to about a meter away from the child, leaving some space between them. This space gave the child a little sense of security, and also allowed her to clearly see the grass dragonfly in Lin Qiao’s hand. Therefore, the child now showed much less repulsion toward her than before.</p>",
  "Chapter 15: The Rise of Speed": "<p>Lin Qiao was unwilling to give up. As she handed the things in her hands to Wu Yueling, she again ‘said’ a few words to her.</p> <p>“Hurr? Hurr?”</p> <p><em>‘Ling Ling? Ling Ling?’ </em>she called her name.</p> <p>At that moment, she noticed a change in Wu Yueling’s expression. The little one paused for a second, then dragged her eyes away from the grass dragonfly in Lin Qiao’s hand to look at her left and then right with confusion, only too see nothing. After that, she turned back and looked at Lin Qiao in the eyes, her eyes filled with confusion.</p> <p>Seeing her reaction, Lin Qiao paused briefly as well. She felt a flicker in her heart, which she suddenly realized was delight.</p> <p>“Hurr, roarrrrr?” She made another series of weird sounds as she tried again to say Wu Yueling’s name. ‘Ling Ling, can you hear me?’ she asked.</p> <p>This time, Wu Yueling’s reaction was unexpected.</p> <p>After hearing Lin Qiao’s voice again, she stared straight at the former as her expression seemed to freeze. She kept staring at Lin Qiao without making any sound, or even having any thought in her mind.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was confused.</p> <p>Had Wu Yueling heard her or not? Why had her expression suddenly frozen like that? Had her voice scared her?</p> <p>From Lu Tianyu’s memories, Lin Qiao had learned that this child was an introvert who never liked to talk. With the exception of her father, she wouldn’t let anyone get near her.</p> <p>She was kidnapped by Lu Tianyu because the latter had used Wu Chengyue as an excuse. Lu Tianyu took advantage of the other’s carelessness and tricked the little girl into a corner, then directly knocked her out and carried her away.</p> <p>As for how a base leader’s daughter could be kidnapped so easily, the sole reason was that Lu Tianyu had a powerful person backing her—another base leader had been helping her.</p> <p>Wu Yueling’s stiff expression relaxed quickly, but her eyes remained vigilant as she gazed at Lin Qiao. She could still see the grass dragonfly in the latter’s hand.</p> <p>As the child focused on the grass dragonfly, Lin Qiao immediately seized the opportunity to hand it to her.</p> <p>By now, Wu Yueling was no longer afraid of Lin Qiao. She had seen a lot of zombies, and they were almost always ugly and gross. However, as long as this zombie didn’t try to bite and eat her, she didn’t care.</p> <p>Looking at the grass dragonfly that Lin Qiao had handed to her, Wu Yueling now understood that it was meant for her. She remained motionless for a while, then slowly reached out her hand from the blanket and carefully took it from the former’s hand.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then slowly placed the funnel near Wu Yueling’s mouth and beckoned her to drink a little. The water had already begun to seep out from the bottom of the funnel.</p> <p>However, Wu Yueling only looked at the water silently without opening her mouth to drink it, but not avoiding it either.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could only keep patiently holding the funnel, afraid to put it down.</p> <p>After about twenty seconds by Lin Qiao’s count, Wu Yueling finally made a move.</p> <p>She lightly and tentatively leaned her mouth toward the funnel in Lin Qiao’s hand, opening her mouth just a little to take a sip of the water in the funnel. About half of the water had already seeped out by that time. She then discovered that the water was quite sweet, so she continued drinking it.</p> <p>By the time the child had finally drunk all the water in the funnel, Lin Qiao felt she should have had sweat trickling down her face, even though zombies didn’t sweat.</p> <p><em>‘Phew! The little princess finally drank some water! My heart is so tired!’ </em>Lin Qiao complained silently.</p> <p>But then, another problem occurred to her. By this time, the child couldn’t feel hunger anymore as she had been starving for too long, but the water she just drank was likely to re-ignite that feeling of hunger.</p> <p>After the girl had finished the water in the leaf funnel, Lin Qiao turned around and fetched another funnel-full of water for the child to drink.</p> <p>After watching her finish the water again, Lin Qiao finally sighed with relief. She put the funnel in her hand, then took a step to the side and left the space.</p> <p>Wu Yueling’s eyes widened as she watched Lin Qiao disappear right in front of her. She stared at the spot where Lin Qiao had disappeared from for a while, then suddenly turned her head and began searching around her.</p> <p>She searched the surrounding area with her eyes, but saw no trace of that weird zombie. There was no one but herself in that place. It was all quiet in there, without even a gust of wind to disturb the environment.</p> <p>Suddenly, a strong and uneasy feeling emerged in Wu Yueling’s heart. She opened her eyes even wider and tried very hard to search around in panic, but still found nothing.</p> <p>There was not a trace of that zombie!</p> <p>Her round eyes suddenly turned red, but she didn’t cry out loud. Instead, she bit her lip tightly and gripped the grass dragonfly that Lin Qiao gave her, again curling up her body.</p> <p>She didn’t notice that both her hunger and thirst had actually been satiated after she drank the lake water that Lin Qiao gave her. Her physical condition wasn’t as bad as Lin Qiao had thought. On the contrary, her energy was now slowly being restored.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Qiao came out of the space and reappeared in the building. She sniffed at the air, sensing a fruity aroma from a long distance away. After that, she turned around immediately and walked toward the stairs.</p> <p>She suddenly discovered that her sense of smell was getting sharper and sharper.</p> <p><em>‘Holy heavens! Am I turning into a dog? It seems that us zombies have quite some useful skills!’ </em>She ran down the stairs at high speed while thinking this.</p> <p>She just wanted to find some food for the little one as quickly as possible. If the little one died before she could send her back to her father, she would become an unforgivable sinner.</p> <p>Thinking of this made her run even faster. At first, she could cover only a few stairs with one step, but later on, she began jumping down and could almost cover a whole staircase with just a few steps while leaving behind a swishing noise.</p> <p>She also noticed that her pace had regulated and was becoming faster and faster. She found that her limbs were nimbler and her legs stronger, yet much lighter than before.</p> <p>She leaped down from the fifth or sixth stair, feeling absolutely no impact as she landed on the hard ground. By this time, she felt that she was as agile and light as a cat.</p> <p>It had taken her a long time to climb these stairs, but by leaping down swiftly, she was soon out of the building.</p> <p>She looked at the sky and found that it was still dark. However, she knew that dawn was coming soon.</p> <p>She turned around and ran as fast as she could in the direction of the fruity aroma.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was an impatient person, and therefore, she would never walk when she could run. At times when she couldn’t run, she would walk fairly fast with giant steps.</p> <p>She was running through the darkness of the night once again while trying to find out how fast she could run.</p> <p>She focused her eyes on her legs and the road while listening to the slight whooshing noise caused by the wind blowing across her ears.</p> <p>If anyone else was here, he or she would have been shocked by seeing how fast she was. She ran like a bolt of lightning, and her speed had already exceeded that of record-breaking Olympic athletes many times over.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao knew nothing of this. She only knew that the longer she ran, the more exhilarated she became. She felt that she could keep running forever as long as she didn’t plan to stop.</p>",
  "Chapter 16: Mutated Strawberry": "<p>After half an hour of running, Lin Qiao’s speed had elevated to another level, although she still remained unaware of this. It was only as she stopped in a strawberry field that she felt a slight chest congestion, and even then, she didn’t know if it was because she had run too far or too fast.</p> <p>However, the chest congestion didn’t seem to affect her body too much, so she quickly ignored it.</p> <p>She stood on the edge of the strawberry field, with dense and lush strawberry plants under her feet.</p> <p>As for why nobody else had discovered this place? It was probably because these strawberries were obviously mutant.</p> <p>In the present post-apocalyptic world, sixty to seventy percent of all the plants on earth had been infected, and were either dead or mutant. Normally, mutant plants would become poisonous or man-eating.</p> <p>Similar to mutant animals, many mutant plants became dreadful killers. That was the reason why the surviving human beings in this world would not go near areas of dense vegetation, such as parks, mountains, and woods.</p> <p>The leaves and roots of the strawberries in front of Lin Qiao were three or four times larger than usual, covering the entire field. The strawberries in this field had a weird green color along with red speckles, and there was a strong rotting smell permeating the whole area.</p> <p>Because of how these mutant strawberries looked, the survivors in this apocalyptic world would all avoid coming near the area by their mere sight. They would not dare to approach, let alone taste them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao, as a matter of fact, was unable to see the color of these strawberries. However, judging from merely their shape, she knew that these strawberries weren’t normal. She was able to detect a faint strawberry aroma underneath the rotten smell, and was confused for a moment.</p> <p>Looking at the appearance of these mutated strawberries, she knew that they shouldn’t be edible in theory. However, after she sensed the hidden aroma, some kind of intuition told her that these strawberries weren’t poisonous.</p> <p>She was puzzled, but didn’t hesitate to go straight down into the strawberry field. The strawberry leaves reached her lower legs.</p> <p>She bent down and picked a large, ripe strawberry, then brought it near her nose to sniff it.</p> <p>The bad odor was still there, but so was the aroma. The mixture of the two scents smelled strange, and made her nose a little itchy.</p> <p>She pulled the strawberry away and rubbed her nose with the other hand while wondering if it was truly edible. Suddenly, she thought of the baby rabbit and the nest of baby mice that she had put into her space earlier.</p> <p>She clutched the pear-sized strawberry, then turned around and disappeared from where she was, as though no zombie had ever visited this strawberry field.</p> <p>There was a flash before her eyes, and then came the familiar white light.</p> <p>She subconsciously searched for the little one the moment she came back. As expected, the child was in the same spot, but had curled up, squatting on the ground.</p> <p><em>‘She is still awake!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little surprised at this.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was squatting sideways with her body wrapped in the blanket and her hands holding the grass dragonfly that Lin Qiao had given her. Therefore, Lin Qiao’s sudden appearance didn’s immediately attract her attention. She squatted there with her head lowered, playing with the grass dragonfly and looking like a chubby roll.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t disturb the child, but turned her head to look around, carefully observing the areas of lush grass and listening for any sound.</p> <p>As expected, she soon heard a slight noise.</p> <p>No wind existed in this space, and therefore, no grass blades would be rustled by any wind.</p> <p>This was the reason why Wu Yueling had felt a little scared after Lin Qiao suddenly disappeared. This place was way too quiet and expansive.</p> <p>Lin Qiao held her breath and quietly walked toward the noise.</p> <p>As for holding her breath, that was actually her imagination as all of her bodily functions had stopped. However, as they said, ‘Old habits die hard’.</p> <p>She walked silently over to a thick growth of grass. Her footsteps were completely soundless, and made no impact against the ground. Therefore, when she quietly reached the place where the noise came from, she saw a fist-sized rabbit squatting among the grass with its back to her, holding a fistful of grass and eating with vigor.</p> <p>The rabbit was totally focused on eating, completely unaware of the zombie standing behind it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly moved closer. She held the strawberry with her left hand and reached out with her right hand, stooping as she slowly extended her hand to within about ten centimeters of the rabbit before thrusting her palm forward and grabbing it.</p> <p>The baby rabbit was startled by the sudden grasp and began struggling, letting out panicked, shrill screams.</p> <p>Lin Qiao lifted it up, watching it twist its body and struggle in her hand. The rabbit’s screams immediately attracted Wu Yueling’s attention.</p> <p>The moment she turned her head, she saw the zombie who had fed her water standing in the grass. The grass reached the zombie’s knees, so she could only see the latter from the thighs up.</p> <p>Wu Yueling couldn’t help but stand up when she saw Lin Qiao. Her eyes sparkled with a trace of surprise as she turned around and stared straight at her. She wasn’t afraid of Lin Qiao anymore, because this zombie didn’t want to eat or kill her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao grasped the rabbit and walked away, not toward Wu Yueling but to a clean area by the lake. Then, she sat on the ground with her legs crossed.</p> <p>She held the baby rabbit, letting it struggle in her hand. After a short while, the baby rabbit slowly calmed down as though it knew that its struggle was futile, or it might have gotten too tired.</p> <p>After the rabbit had quieted down, Lin Qiao put the strawberry from her other hand close to the rabbit’s face in order to see its reaction. She didn’t know if the rabbit liked strawberries or not, and even if it didn’t agree to eat it, she intended to stick a piece of the strawberry into its mouth to see if there would be any toxic reaction.</p> <p>Maybe because the smell of the strawberry made its nose twitch, the rabbit’s reaction was to draw back immediately, then turn its nose and mouth as far away from the strawberry as possible.</p> <p>Lin Qiao patiently held the strawberry. She didn’t break off a piece to put into the rabbit’s mouth right away, but waited to see if it would sense its aroma.</p> <p>However, the rabbit didn’t seem to sense the faint, fruity aroma. Quite a while had passed, but it still didn’t turn its head back.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had no choice but to put the strawberry down and hold the rabbit on the ground to immobilize it. Next, she broke off a piece of the strawberry with her fingers and popped it directly into the rabbit’s mouth. Then, she pinched its mouth and thrust the strawberry piece straight down its throat.</p> <p>As a result, the piece of strawberry was stuck in the rabbit’s throat. The rabbit was unable to cough it out, and had to swallow it.</p> <p>After putting the strawberry piece into the rabbit’s throat, Lin Qiao lifted it and continued to observe it. When she forced it to eat the strawberry, it had kicked its hind legs strongly for a few times, but made no other reaction after that.</p> <p>One second, two seconds, three seconds… A minute passed by. Lin Qiao shook the rabbit and found it to be still alive, without showing any sign of dying.</p> <p>How long did chronic poisoning take? The rabbit was not displaying any adverse reaction yet, but would the poison attack later after making its way through the rabbit’s system?</p> <p>As she was thinking about this, Lin Qiao abruptly swung her arm and threw the rabbit aside onto the grass. Then, she turned and saw Wu Yueling, who was standing silently behind her, less than three meters away.</p>",
  "Chapter 17: Mutation and Mutation": "<p>Lin Qiao was speechless.</p> <p>After being thrown onto the grassland, the rabbit sprung to life immediately. It turned around and darted away, disappearing into the grass.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was standing at a distance, watching Lin Qiao’s every move.</p> <p>At first, she thought that this zombie was going to eat the cute baby rabbit, and hence was quite nervous for the latter. But then, she slowly realized that things were not as she had thought. She also saw that the zombie was holding a strawberry-like fruit.</p> <p>Then, she watched the strange zombie feed the strawberry to the rabbit.</p> <p>Her dad had told her that all the plants out here were mutant and poisonous, and only the plants at the base were edible. She also knew that normal strawberries were red, and were much smaller than the one she was seeing right now.</p> <p>The color of the strawberry held in this zombie’s hand was just too weird! Her dad had said that the mutations in plants mainly affected their shapes and colors, and therefore, she was quite sure that this strawberry must be mutant.</p> <p>She was shocked that the zombie would feed this poisonous, mutated strawberry to the little rabbit. Would the little rabbit die now?</p> <p>The rabbit didn’t seem like it wanted to touch the strawberry, but the zombie had stuffed a small piece into its mouth.</p> <p>Wu Yueling suddenly became frightened of the zombie once again.</p> <p>Therefore, when Lin Qiao saw Wu Yueling, the latter took her blanket and quickly withdrew to over twenty meters away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was speechless again.</p> <p><em>‘Why did you come so close if you are afraid of me?’</em></p> <p>She rolled her eyes in her heart. A zombie could never understand what a child was thinking.</p> <p>After seeing the rabbit hop away briskly, Lin Qiao decided to check on it in half an hour. She took the mutant strawberry which now had a little hole on it, then stood up and walked to the lake to wash it in the water.</p> <p>After washing it, she held it to her face and examined it. She was about to take a bite, but suddenly paused when her teeth touched the strawberry.</p> <p>She snapped her mouth close and held the strawberry to her nose to sniff it, then found something strange.</p> <p>The rotten smell of the strawberry had disappeared, leaving behind only that faint sweet aroma.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Where has the stench gone?’</em></p> <p>Confused, Lin Qiao sniffed it again and confirmed that the strong stink had really disappeared.</p> <p>How did it disappear?</p> <p>She was perplexed, but delighted at the same time. After all, without the stink, the strawberry had become much more acceptable than before.</p> <p>With this thought, she immediately put the strawberry into her mouth and took a bite.</p> <p>As a zombie, she surely couldn’t taste any flavor, but the texture was still there. The strawberry was tender, juicy, soft, and refreshing. It tasted like a normal strawberry, just meatier and juicier.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed with disappointment, feeling a little sorry for herself as her tongue could not taste anything now.</p> <p>As for the strawberry being poisonous or not, she wasn’t concerned as she was a zombie herself and the strawberry wouldn’t kill her even if it were poisonous. She was infected by the virus already, so the virus in fruits could no longer harm her.</p> <p>However, she was concerned about the altered smell of the strawberry. She would have a clearer indication after she had checked on the rabbit’s condition again.</p> <p>Although the rabbit was also a mutant, it was different from the mutant plants. Mutant animals didn’t carry any virus, and only the animals which had turned into zombie animals would carry it within their bodies.</p> <p>Living mutant animals with flesh and blood like this little rabbit were similar to superpowered human beings. Some parts of them had changed, but the physiological functions of their bodies remained unchanged.</p> <p>Therefore, the flesh and blood of living mutant animals remained the same as before. The only difference in them was that their mutation had given them upgraded powers.</p> <p>Wu Yueling fixed her eyes on Lin Qiao, watching this zombie actually eat the mutant strawberry. She surely knew that this zombie wouldn’t be harmed by the virus, but she still felt weird about it.</p> <p><em>‘As a zombie, shouldn’t you eat and bite human beings? Shouldn’t you pounce on every living human being you see?’</em></p> <p>She was young, but she wasn’t stupid. She grew up in the post-apocalyptic world, and her dad had taught her lots of things. Therefore, she was quite familiar with this world.</p> <p>Was the zombie hungry as well? Why would this hungry zombie eat a strawberry instead of her?</p> <p>Even as a smart child, Wu Yueling struggled to comprehend Lin Qiao’s behavior with her five-year-old mind.</p> <p>To be honest, she thought that even an adult would be confused by this zombie’s behavior! Who had ever seen a zombie leave a live human being alone and eat a strawberry? Even if she was an intelligent zombie, she couldn’t possibly change her instinctive urge to eat human beings, could she? What on earth was this strawberry-eating zombie?</p> <p>While Wu Yueling was staring at Lin Qiao in confusion, Lin Qiao had also been observing the former with suspicion.</p> <p>Due to the occupation that she had before she came back to life, her observation would always happen unwittingly. Before she realized that she was doing it, she would often find that she had unconsciously observed the environment around her and had every detail imprinted in her brain. Therefore, once she had scanned the area again to compare it with what was already in her head, she would be able to identify the differences.</p> <p>Right now, Lin Qiao realized that something was not quite right with Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Earlier on, this child looked faint and weak from hunger, yet she now looked nothing like someone who hadn’t eaten for days, despite the fact that she was just a little child!</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Yuling was standing seven or eight meters away from Lin Qiao, but the latter could still see her face clearly.</p> <p>Her face was still pale, but her eyes were luminous again. Even though her gaze toward Lin Qiao remained vigilant, there was also confusion and some curiosity there. The weakness and dimness in her eyes were already gone, along with the desperation and all the other negative emotions.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that children tended to change as quickly and suddenly as the weather. They were unpredictable, and would laugh or cry without any warning.</p> <p>Earlier on, this little one had been so terrified of Lin Qiao, but now, her curiosity allowed her to get closer.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know what had happened to this little one. Earlier on, she had been worried that the girl might die, but now, this child was standing right in front of her, seeming to be quite fine.</p> <p><em>‘You have already taken my grass dragonfly. Why are you still hiding from me?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao could tell that this kid was pretty smart. She was able to differentiate the good people from the bad ones, and she wouldn’t believe every word that the others said.</p> <p>Based on Lu Tianyu’s memories, Wu Yueling loathed her. When she was tricked by the former, she had refused to believe her at first. However, the former had uncovered some secrets about Wu Chengyue with Yang Chao’s help, and armed with those, she managed to lure Wu Yueling away. Wu Yueling was still filled with suspicion back then, and soon had realized that things weren’t right. So, although she turned around and ran, how could she outrun Lu Tianyu? As a result, she was directly knocked out.</p>",
  "Chapter 18: Intelligent Zombie": "<p>While looking at Wu Yueling, Lin Qiao chewed the strawberry unconsciously. The strawberry soon melted in her mouth and was swallowed directly. Sadly, she didn’t find it to be delicious, neither did she feel that her stomach was satisfied.</p> <p>After that first bite, she didn’t want to continue eating the strawberry. Glancing at the strawberry in her hand once which now had a bite missing, she threw it onto the grass.</p> <p>She looked at the grass dragonfly in Wu Yueling’s hands and gave it some thought, then raised her arm abruptly and waved at the latter, gesturing for her to come over.</p> <p>However, Wu Yueling turned and ran immediately when she saw Lin Qiao wave at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed.</p> <p><em>‘Alright…’ </em>Since the little one refused to come to her, she decided to have some fun by herself.</p> <p>She glanced at where Wu Yueling had run to and saw that she had hidden in the grass. She wondered if the girl was afraid of bugs.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned around and walked to a thick patch of grass, picking up a few long grass blades. These grass blades were able to create thin gashes on human skin as they had burrs on the edges, and would harden when they matured. However, her hands couldn’t be harmed by these grass blades because she was a zombie!</p> <p>After picking some grass blades, she wove and folded them to make a grass frog, a grass ball, a grass butterfly, and several other small trinkets…</p> <p>She finished weaving and put these small trinkets into a clearing, then glanced at Wu Yueling, who had stuck her head out to peep at her from her hiding place. After that, she turned around and left the space.</p> <p>She didn’t know where this space originated from. She had no idea if it was brought here or created by her own soul, or maybe had existed inside Lu Tianyu’s body and yet was never activated by her. She didn’t know the exact function of this space either, but she did know that storing and growing plants within it were possible.</p> <p>As soon as she left the space, Lin Qiao made a spot to sit down, then looked at the sky that was brightening by now.</p> <p>She realized that she didn’t need to sleep as she didn’t get tired. Did zombies really need no sleep? She looked at the zombies who had been wandering in this city in the middle of the night and felt that that might be true.</p> <p>The strawberry field wasn’t far away from the city. Therefore, there must be zombies wandering nearby Yet, these zombies were scattered here and there, and not gathered in a mob.</p> <p>She was thinking about how she could get to South Cloud Island Base faster.</p> <p><em>‘That’s it! I should find a driveable vehicle.’ </em>Somehow, she had forgotten about this plan from earlier on, and hadn’t thought about the car for a while. Perhaps it was because she had become too focused on finding food, and then began worrying about Wu Yueling.</p> <p>It seemed that after filling up her stomach, she needed to find a car first.</p> <p>There were many cars of every make and model abandoned in the SZ district, but she didn’t know whether they were still driveable or not. The gasoline in the gas stations might have been looted long ago, and it was questionable as to whether she would find any.</p> <p>She touched her belly and felt that it was now full of bumps and hollows, leading to a very strange feeling. Back when she was an ordinary human, her physical perception of human bodies had been deeply ingrained since long ago. Now that she was in this state, if she were still a human being, she would have been tortured almost to death by the pain even if she remained alive.</p> <p>Fortunately, she felt nothing in such a state. She thought that she was fortunate to have become a zombie, because the pain caused by all the traumas that this body had suffered would have surely killed her otherwise!</p> <p>She raised her nose and sniffed around, but detected no aroma to arouse her appetite, nor did she detect anything that she wanted to eat.</p> <p>She sighed and decided to look around her.</p> <p>She wouldn’t starve to death even if she failed to find any food, but this constant hunger was very uncomfortable. Even finding another mouse to snack on would be nice at this point!</p> <p>In passing, she could also try to find Wu Chengyue and his people, so that she could return the little one to them. After that, she wouldn’t have to worry about the child at least!</p> <p>She stood up right away, then turned around and began walking.</p> <p>After leaving the strawberry field, she walked into the city. However, she stopped soon afterward with her ears twitching slightly before she continued on.</p> <p>She walked a while longer, then suddenly leaped to the side as she reached a factory area. After swiftly rolling on the ground, she knelt on one knee and lowered her body, supporting herself with her arms. Fully alert, she stared at a monster which had suddenly and silently pounced on her from the top of a two-story factory.</p> <p>Even though it was a monster, it looked humanoid. Judging by its appearance, it should have been a high-level zombie. Its face had lost the original, identifiable human features. Its eyes were black without any white sclera, similar to Lin Qiao’s. Those pure black eyes also had a weird luster.</p> <p>The original shape of its nose was still recognizable, but the mouth was cracked wide open, stretching from the left ear to the right. Once it opened that mouth, Lin Qiao could see its elongated teeth protruding from the rotten gums. A dark, dirty liquid was dripping from those teeth, emitting a rotten stench.</p> <p>The zombie was standing on a pair of slightly bent legs. Its back was hunched, and its fists were held contortedly before its chest to form a claw. Its eyes sparkled with a vicious greed as it stared at Lin Qiao, facing her in a hunting posture while treating her as prey.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could sense a strange vibe emanating from the zombie. It was like the vibes of humans, specifically those who were dominant and held positions of power.</p> <p>Judging by its vibe, Lin Qiao guessed that it was a peak-level-three intelligent zombie.</p> <p>Why would this kind of a zombie attack her? Lin Qiao had no answer to that question.</p> <p>She searched through Lu Tianyu’s memories and found that even though that woman had done all kinds of evil things at her base, she hadn’t ever seen a high-level zombie herself.</p> <p>Based on her memories, she only knew that high-level zombies would attack lower level zombies and then dig out their zombie nucleus to strengthen themselves.</p> <p>Lin Qiao recalled that she had cut a zombie’s head earlier on when saving the unconscious man. After that, a crystal piece had fallen out of the zombie’s head and disappeared directly after being pinched by her.</p> <p>Had she absorbed it? No wonder!</p> <p>It seemed that this high-level zombie was seeing her as its prey. Was its intention to dig out the nucleus in her head?</p> <p>Lin Qiao narrowed her eyes. She was on full alert, but her entire body had been locked on by this high-level zombie. She knew that the moment she moved, the zombie would burst up and fly at her.</p> <p>She sneered silently. She was also an intelligent zombie, and even though her vibe was suppressed, she hadn’t experienced a strong sense of danger. Besides, even if she was unable to defeat this high-level zombie, couldn’t she just run? Even if she failed to run, she still had her space! Would this zombie be able to follow her into her space?</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao didn’t know that she was only a basic-stage level-three zombie, while the one in front of her was already at the peak of level-three, and was preparing to step up to level-four.</p> <p>It had set its sight on Lin Qiao because it wanted to use her zombie nucleus for its own evolution. It could easily absorb level-three zombie nuclei, but there was one disadvantage—for a level-three zombie, the energy contained in one level-three zombie nucleus might not be great enough to help it cross the bottleneck to enter level-four. If this level-three zombie had found a level-four superpowered nucleus, it would definitely be able to level up. However, a level-three zombie without a superpower had no qualification of casting its greedy eyes on level-four zombies.</p> <p>Furthermore, finding a level-four zombie nucleus by the roadside was absolutely impossible.</p> <p>Therefore, this level-three zombie had decided to go for the second best option, which was finding as many level-three zombie nuclei as possible. It had decided to choose quantity over quality, as the accumulation of energy might also lead to a breakthrough.</p> <p>Besides, it had sensed that Lin Qiao was just a newly upgraded level-three zombie, and that her power didn’t seem to be stable yet.</p>",
  "Chapter 19: The Energy of A Zombie Nucleus": "<p>Lin Qiao stared at this intelligent zombie vigilantly, while the latter stared right back at her. She had noticed that there were no other zombies around, making this place a little empty… and now she knew why.</p> <p>The other zombies in this area should either have been cleaned out or scared away by this intelligent zombie.</p> <p>Low-level zombies were instinctively afraid of high-level zombies. Therefore, once a high-level zombie showed up in an area with limited self-control, low-level zombies would all instinctively avoid it and run as far away as possible.</p> <p>Moreover, this was an intelligent zombie with an I.Q. comparable to five to ten-year-old children. It already knew how to make a sneak attack, which meant it was quite smart.</p> <p>Just as Lin Qiao was taking in the details of the surrounding environment, the intelligent zombie in front of her moved suddenly.</p> <p>It bent its legs and thrust them against the ground to pounce on Lin Qiao at an incredible speed. Within just one-tenth of a second, it had rushed up to Lin Qiao from meters away, its ten shiny, sharp fingernails stabbing at her.</p> <p>The claws of high-level zombies were incredibly sharp, even harder than diamonds. Lin Qiao knew this because she had a pair of claws just like that of her own.</p> <p>When the enemy attacked so suddenly and swiftly, Lin Qiao only had time to turn her body and launch a punch. At that moment, her zombie instincts weren’t working, and all she had were her old combat skills which had automatically taken over.</p> <p>Fortunately, her reaction was fast enough as she had been vigilant against the enemy, and her punch landed squarely on the intelligent zombie’s side face.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>The intelligent zombie flew sideways, landing heavily in a walled corner seven or eight meters away and rolling twice on the ground.</p> <p>After making these rolls, the intelligent zombie immediately bounced back up and faced Lin Qiao. It supported its body with arms, with its legs bent like an animal as it stared fiercely at her.</p> <p>However, there was also confusion in its fierce eyes.</p> <p>It was struck dumb by Lin Qiao’s punch!</p> <p>It clearly sensed that Lin Qiao wasn’t strong, nor was she at a higher level than itself. Logically speaking, Lin Qiao should have been no match. And yet for some reason, she had not only thwarted its attack, but also landed a punch on its face.</p> <p>“Wooo!” The intelligent zombie uttered a roar deep from its throat as it pondered over this. Its voice was weird and unpleasant to hear, containing an oppressive warning that sounded like the warning from a higher-positioned being to a lower-positioned one. This warning promised that if the one who had been warned refused to obey, it would be punished.</p> <p>This kind of roar was only effective amongst zombies. A lower-level zombie would be frightened the moment it heard this roar, and would either surrender or run in panic.</p> <p>Clearly, this zombie intended to suppress Lin Qiao in this way.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao seemed to not hear this roar as she just looked at him quietly.</p> <p>She flexed and extended her fingers while feeling surprised that she had actually punched this zombie seven or eight meters away. It seemed that besides her sharp claws, she also had great strength!</p> <p>Fortunately, her reactions were not much slower than those of this intelligent zombie. After that first punch, Lin Qiao was slightly more confident about her fighting abilities.</p> <p>She looked at this intelligent zombie and suddenly smiled wickedly, letting out a roar of her own.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Her roar was also deep, but slightly higher-pitched than the roar of the intelligent zombie.</p> <p>That was clearly provocative!</p> <p>‘Damn! Don’t you wanna bite me? Come on! Fight me if you can! Let’s see how good you really are!’</p> <p>As Lin Qiao expected, the intelligent zombie in front of her was enraged as soon as it heard her roar. The provocative meaning in her voice was too obvious, and it made this high-level zombie feel badly offended.</p> <p>“Roar!” It burst into a loud roar, then thrust its four limbs against the ground and again rushed at her, even faster than before.</p> <p>Watching it pounce on her like a fierce wild dog, Lin Qiao bent her legs slightly. She aimed at her enemy at the same time as it launched at her, finally leaping high to dive down on her from the air.</p> <p>She lowered her body to give herself some space, then suddenly lifted her hands as the zombie flew overhead. Then, she grasped its legs and tugged them backward before smashing it violently onto the ground.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>A muffled noise was heard as the zombie’s fleshy body bumped against the ground. As it was flying over Lin Qiao’s head, this intelligent zombie never expected its legs to be grabbed. In that instant, it felt its forward motion pause and reverse, followed by it being suddenly turned upside down.</p> <p>It was smashed heavily down onto the hard ground on its back. The impact shook its entire body and made it feel like its bones were falling apart.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had a great strength, and for this move, she had utilized all of it. On hearing the thud as the zombie smashed onto the ground, she knew that it must have suffered severely, but she didn’t stop because of that. The next second, she flexed and then extended her fingers, popping out her dark claws and swiftly stabbing the zombie’s head.</p> <p>“Roar…” The intelligent zombie didn’t even manage to utter its roar before Lin Qiao directly cut off half of its head.</p> <p>Thick brain matter splashed all over the ground, with a green rhombus crystal piece that was around the size of a thumb mixed in the brains.</p> <p>Zombie nucleus!</p> <p>From Lu Tianyu’s memories, Lin Qiao had learned about the different levels and corresponding colors of zombie nuclei, as well as their functions. She now knew that she was able to absorb the energies in zombie nuclei, mutant animals nuclei, and the crystal nuclei from human beings.</p> <p>She felt this was very similar to the settings of the post-apocalyptic fictions that she had read online.</p> <p>Ranging from low-level to high-level, the colors of zombie nuclei were white, transparent, grey, green, blue, yellow, orange, red, purple, and black. The nuclei of ordinary zombies were all white, while the nuclei of the highest leveled, level-nine superpowered zombies were black.</p> <p>She scratched away the brain matter of this intelligent zombie with her sharp nails, then picked out its nucleus and pinched it with her fingers.</p> <p>The zombie nucleus was searing hot, but that did not concern her.</p> <p>That was because in the next instant, she sensed that the heat had turned into a warm current which flowed into her body through her fingers, circulating in her entire body, from her head to her feet, before returning to her brain at last.</p> <p>The warm current didn’t stop flowing ceaselessly through her body.</p> <p>She felt very comfortable. All of her body parts that the warm current reached were aching at first, then comforted and refreshed as if someone was massaging her.</p> <p>She felt all of her pores open, and a few minutes later, the green zombie nucleus in her hand slowly shrank and then disappeared.</p> <p>After the warm current ceased, Lin Qiao let out a long breath.</p> <p>Having been nourished by this wave of energy, she felt that her body had become lighter, and the luster on her claws had gotten brighter. She retracted her claws and made fists, but felt no changes in her strength.</p> <p>Zombie nuclei were energy sources, and absorbing energy felt seriously good indeed! No wonder intelligent zombies would attack lower-level zombies. However, intelligent zombies liked the crystal nuclei of human beings even more.</p>",
  "Chapter 20: Stolen Prey": "<p>The flesh of superpowered human beings was sweet and tasty, and the energy contained in their crystal nuclei was pure, unlike the zombie nuclei which had too many impurities.</p> <p>Just like zombies, humans sought zombie nuclei as well. The most profitable job in the bases at that time was zombie-hunting indeed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t think that this level-three zombie would actually be quite weak. Although this fight was simple and violent, it was over quickly.</p> <p>The energy contained in the zombie nucleus soothed her entire body but failed to quench her hunger. She still wanted to eat.</p> <p><em>‘I want meat! Meat! Meat!’</em></p> <p>While roaring in her head, she took a simple glance at the intelligent zombie, then turned and left.</p> <p>…</p> <p>The sky was already brightening, and the surrounding area was becoming clearer. She couldn’t see a lot of colors, but she could still sense the change in the light. After finishing off this intelligent zombie which had shown up out of the blue, Lin Qiao turned around and continued moving forward, in search for a drivable car.</p> <p>Not long after she had left, a few people showed up and surrounded the dead intelligent zombie, their faces filled with surprise and confusion.</p> <p>“Is it dead? How come?” Liu Hongshi said in amazement as he stared at the corpse on the ground. The other two didn’t respond, only observing the dead zombie with somber expressions.</p> <p>Lin Yong took a look at the zombie, then pointed at its head which had been cut open and said, “It was killed by another intelligent zombie. The edge of the wound on its head is rough, clearly created by bare hands. Only intelligent zombies at level-three or above can cause damage like this.”</p> <p>Liang Caiyan frowned slightly and nodded.</p> <p>Liu Hongshi’s face was a little dark as he stared at the dead zombie and said, “We’ve been chasing it for so long, only for it to be killed by another zombie! Our efforts have been wasted!”</p> <p>Lin Yong’s face was also dark with anger, but he didn’t say a word.</p> <p>“This should be the only level-three zombie in this area. Has some newcomer seized its territory?” Liang Caiyan asked with confusion.</p> <p>Every high-level zombie was territorial. A level-three zombie would find an ownerless area, occupy it, and claim it as its own territory. If another level-three zombie wanted to live in this area permanently, it would need to drive the original level-three zombie away.</p> <p>The weak had always been prey for the strong, and this was the most primitive law applicable in this world.</p> <p>The strong would live while the weak would die.</p> <p>Hence, if two high-level zombies fought over a territory, the weaker one would always die unless it ran fast enough. Thus, if the newcomer was a higher-level zombie, the original territory owner would flee right away without any doubt!</p> <p>“This zombie wasn’t wounded by a superpower because there was no trace of it left in the surroundings. Its enemy wasn’t a superpowered zombie but a level-three one just like it. However, that other zombie managed to cut its head so neatly, which is quite strange,” said Lin Yong.</p> <p>The other two looked around them. As Lin Yong had said, there was no damage done to the surrounding area by any superpower, and there was no other wound on this intelligent zombie’s body either. This zombie was killed with one clean move! A level-three zombie without any superpower couldn’t possibly achieve this.</p> <p>Besides, this dead zombie was just a breath away from becoming a level-four zombie. Among all level-three zombies, it was already close to level-four, just lacking in a superpower. It shouldn’t possibly have been killed by a same-level intelligent zombie so easily!</p> <p>“Could it be a level-four zombie with super strength?” Liang Caiyan thought of this possibility and said hesitantly.</p> <p>Lin Yong nodded with a serious look.</p> <p>Liu Hongshi sounded shocked as he said, “What? Level-four? We’ve been in this area for so long with no hint of a level-four zombie showing up! Could it be wrong?”</p> <p>Liang Caiyan glanced at him and said, “Do you think a level-three intelligent zombie could kill it so easily and neatly? Even if a level-three zombie could kill it, a great and long fight would be inevitable! But look around you, no any trace of a fight at all! Does it look like a big fight happened here?”</p> <p>Liu Hongshi had no answer to this.</p> <p>She was right. What kind of level-three zombie could kill a nearly level-four zombie so easily and quickly?</p> <p>However, he wasn’t about to give up as he said, “Then, what should we do now? Go after that level-four zombie?”</p> <p>As soon as he said this, the faces of the other two immediately darkened!</p> <p>They had had their sights locked on this zombie and had chased it for a month already, but it fell into another zombie’s hands in the end!</p> <p>This result was so unacceptable that they felt like vomiting blood!</p> <p>However, they were no match for level-four zombies with their current powers. They were all superpowered—two at level-three and one at level-four. However, when facing zombies of this level, they were all defenseless.</p> <p>Human beings didn’t have the high speed and great strength of zombies. In addition to their speed and strength, zombies had beast-like instincts. Therefore, a high-level zombie could defeat three average superpowered human beings easily at one time!</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao found quite a few cars abandoned by the roadside, but couldn’t start any of them even after trying many times. She struggled for quite a while but failed to find even one drivable car.</p> <p>She couldn’t help but feel a little frustrated as she found no food or car.</p> <p>Suddenly, she thought of the rabbit in her space.</p> <p>Right! She needed to see if the rabbit had died from poisoning after eating the mutant strawberry!</p> <p>At the thought of this, she immediately entered her space.</p> <p>She looked around as soon as she entered her space, but couldn’t see Wu Yueling. She then located the child by using her sense of smell, after which, she walked into the thick grass.</p> <p>She didn’t go to Wu Yueling though, and instead went to find the rabbit.</p> <p>In fact, she didn’t need to use her sense of smell at all, because she somehow had a foresight like a sixth sense in her space, and it was especially potent.</p> <p>She had a sense of where Wu Yueling was, and she confirmed it by sniffing. She also had a faint sense of the rabbit and the few baby mice which hadn’t opened their eyes yet. The sense of the baby mice was exceptionally weak, and she would have missed it if she wasn’t seeking it specifically.</p> <p>The few baby mice were tenacious. They had been left here for so long, but hadn’t starved to death.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought that she might just eat these few furless little things to satiate her hunger if she couldn’t find any other food.</p> <p>She walked to the rabbit quietly and saw that it was burrowing, as she had expected.</p> <p>It didn’t die! That meant that the strawberries were edible!</p> <p>Lin Qiao happily looked at the hunched rabbit digging vigorously with its pair of forepaws. She could tell for sure that this rabbit had created more than one burrow.</p> <p>The rabbit was so focused on its digging that it hadn’t felt the presence of the zombie behind it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao observed it for a while and stopped worrying. Then, she stood up and walked over to Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was sleeping right by the lake, curled up in a clearing by the edge of the grass, having wrapped herself in the blanket.</p> <p>A faint smile appeared on Lin Qiao’s stiff face as she saw that the little grass toys that she had made scattered around the kid. However, she couldn’t see how eerie that smile would be for any other person who happened to look at her.</p> <p>She took another glance at Wu Yueling, then turned around and flashed out of her space. As soon as she reappeared where she had disappeared from outside, she began running swiftly toward the strawberry field.</p>",
  "Chapter 21: The Current Situation in the Apocalyptic World": "<p>She didn’t know that the intelligent zombie she had just killed was being hunted by others. Neither did she know that she had snatched away the prey of those hunters. The only thing she did know was that the level-three zombie’s nucleus seemed useless to her.</p> <p>She felt content while absorbing the energy, but nothing other than that. She couldn’t understand why high-level zombies liked to collect zombie nuclei.</p> <p>Thinking all that, she ran toward the strawberry field which wasn’t far away. Her speed had increased so much that she was now running as fast as a gust of wind.</p> <p>Moreover, she was the only zombie who dared to run so undisguisedly on a broad road.</p> <p>Daytime had arrived again by now. The other zombies were all moving slowly while she was running like the wind. By running at such a speed, she was clearly telling the others that a high-level zombie existed in this area, wasn’t she? After all, all the other high-level zombies now had crisis awareness. They hid themselves because they feared being hunted and rounded up by human beings.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao didn’t care about any of this because she had yet to fully and deeply realize the fact that she was a zombie even at that moment. Besides, she tended to be simple-minded sometimes, and wouldn’t over-think an issue.</p> <p>It was due to precisely this reason that she was soon targeted.</p> <p>“Eh? Damn! Come on! A high-level zombie!” Among the members of a small freely-formed zombie hunting squad who had been resting on the third floor of a building, a man had been sitting by the window and looking down onto the road. At that moment, he saw a figure rush past, leaving clouds of smoke and dust behind it.</p> <p>Its speed was that of someone driving a sports car!</p> <p>The man sitting at the window glanced down but failed to see Lin Qiao’s appearance clearly, just her back as she disappeared within a blink.</p> <p>He leaped up immediately.</p> <p>In the post-apocalyptic world, people would normally come out of bases in groups. They would either join freely formed zombie hunting groups or would become parts of the zombie hunting squads attached to the regular army. Absolutely no human dared to take any action alone, not even high-level superpowered people.</p> <p>A superpowered human being would get exhausted at some point, no matter how powerful he or she was. However, zombies were everywhere, crowding toward every living human being they found. They were slow, but a mass of zombies could still overpower and kill superpowered human beings. After all, when zombies detected the scent of living human beings, they would fearlessly rush up again and again with no other sense than the desire to feed, just like a wolf pack eyeing fresh meat.</p> <p>“Where?” The other zombie hunters immediately rushed over to the man at the window on hearing him exclaim ‘high-level zombie’. They stuck their heads out of the window to look outside, but saw nothing.</p> <p>The young man who saw Lin Qiao shoved the others out of the way, then supported his body with his arms and directly leaped down from the window on the third floor.</p> <p>“Cut the crap! It’ll be gone if we don’t chase!” Huang Xiao leaped down from the window, nimbly rolled forward on the ground, then swiftly jumped back up and started chasing after Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Huang Xiao!” Seeing him rush out, Xie Dong shouted out, his brow knitted in a frown.</p> <p>After Huang Xiao jumped out of the window, the others all stepped back and then swarmed to the second floor. The few agile ones directly leaped down from the second floor, while the two slower ones rushed down to the first floor and exited the building the last. Like wolves that had sighted meat, the group of people followed Huang Xiao, running in Lin Qiao’s direction.</p> <p>Xie Dong followed behind these people. His face was expressionless except for his knitted brows, which indicated his anger.</p> <p>The bases were no longer running short of food by now as some people with botanical superpowers had been able to plant and grow fruits and vegetables. With that, every base had already planted large amounts of crops. The apocalyptic world soil couldn’t be compared with that in the old world, but it was good enough to keep people from dying of hunger.</p> <p>The resources from the old world had greatly depleted because of the consumption in the past few years. By this time, rice and flour could only be afforded by high-level base leaders. The ordinary survivors would get nothing more than a hard, steamed bread that tasted like chaff, and a small bottle of water per day.</p> <p>Accommodations were also graded. Survivors without superpowers or strong backgrounds had no other choice but to live in big tents. A big tent would accommodate tens of people, and sometimes over a hundred. Consequently, they would be very crowded, dirty, and messy. Only superpowered people and administrators could afford to live in single rooms or other relatively luxurious accommodations in the buildings inside the bases.</p> <p>After the apocalyptic era had begun, the weather had changed significantly. The daytime was scorching hot while the nighttime was icy cold. The difference in temperature between day and night was dramatic. During the daytime, the temperature varied from forty to fifty degrees, but during the night, it would drop to about ten degrees. People wouldn’t be frozen to death, but would still feel awfully cold.</p> <p>The people who wanted decent food would have to accept missions and venture out of the bases. Only when they brought back valuable things would they be able to trade these items for better food and accommodation. And of course, high-level zombie nuclei were very precious.</p> <p>Currently, there was no minimum requirement of numbers for the people who dared to leave the bases. The base administrators didn’t care about these things. They would give permission for leaving to one single person or a hundred-men group, as long as people signed in and out. In particular, the people returning to the bases had to pass strict inspections, in case they brought the virus back to the bases.</p> <p>Most of the people who ventured out were hunting zombies for their nuclei. Zombie nuclei could strengthen the crystal nuclei of human beings, which were also called superpower nuclei. Therefore, strong superpowered human beings were the main force of defense against zombies. In order to grow stronger, these superpowered people would all go out to hunt high-level zombies or purchase zombie nuclei from other people at the bases.</p> <p>Among the group of people chasing after Lin Qiao at the moment, Huang Xiao was a peak-level-three superpowered human being, and the Captain, Xie Dong, was at level-four. All the others were merely cannon fodder at levels one and two.</p> <p>That was the way things worked in the post-apocalyptic world. The weak people depended on the strong for survival, while the strong recruited underlings as expendable cannon fodder to shield themselves and save their own strength.</p> <p>Huang Xiao was the Deputy Captain of this temporary squad. In terms of power, his level-three wind superpower made him the second strongest in the squad.</p> <p>The main strength of the squad was Xie Dong, who had level-four fire power. He was in the special forces before the apocalyptic era began, so it was fairly reasonable for him to be the Captain of this squad. He had a well-featured face and a commanding military presence, which made him appear very serious and unapproachable. As he was outstandingly capable, he was the one making decisions for the squad most of the time, and the others had been simply following him. They could choose not to follow him, but he wouldn’t bother to protect them in that case, as he didn’t have to be responsible for the lives of those who were disobedient to him.</p> <p>However, one person didn’t think this way.</p> <p>Huang Xiao activated his wind power after leaping down from the third floor ahead of the others, then immediately chased Lin Qiao to a long distance away. At that time, it was already too late for Xie Dong to call his name from behind, so he could only follow behind his squad while restraining his anger.</p> <p>The nuclei of high-level zombies were especially precious, but one would be foolish to disregard their fighting ability and wisdom.</p> <p>In the post-apocalyptic world, it took great efforts and a long time for zombies to upgrade. Therefore, high-level zombies were pretty rare.</p> <p>A level-three zombie nucleus could be exchanged for a bagful of white flour, while a level-four zombie nucleus could be traded for a bagful of rice, five top-quality quilts, and a few sets of clean clothes. That was why many people desperately wanted to take out high-level zombies in order to secure these commodities.</p>",
  "Chapter 22: The Human Being who Blocked the Way": "<p>Xie Dong frowned, unsure about the level of this zombie that Huang Xiao had seen. If it were level-four, then that would be a serious problem.</p> <p>Level-four superpowered zombies were quite rare, and level-five ones were seen even less. In the recent two years, only two or three level-five zombie leaders had shown up. They were all exceptionally powerful, and the people who had unfortunately encountered them were mostly dead.</p> <p>Currently, level four was the highest level of the zombies that people could find frequently. Level-three intelligent zombies were more often seen than level-four ones of course. With the strength of Xie Dong’s squad, they might truly face a troublesome situation if it were a level-four superpowered zombie.</p> <p>…</p> <p>While running, Lin Qiao suddenly sensed the scent of human beings from behind.</p> <p>She knew that a human squad was there when she ran past that area earlier as she had sensed the human aroma from a long distance. She just didn’t take it seriously, as she felt that if she left them alone, they would do the same to her.</p> <p>At no point had she expected that these people would want to provoke her even when she caused no offense to them!</p> <p>She stopped, then turned around and quietly stared at the human being who had almost caught up with her.</p> <p>The man was very fast. Lin Qiao could sense the waves of superpower emanating from him. She had guessed that he was gifted with wind power, because she could see how fast and swift his steps were.</p> <p>Seeing that the zombie had suddenly stopped, Huang Xiao’s heart immediately flipped with joy. He rushed and stopped twenty meters away from Lin Qiao, his eyes fixed on this female zombie while looking at her from head to toe.</p> <p>This zombie’s hair hung loosely but seemed quite clean. Her face had been destroyed, entirely covered by large tearing wounds, such that it was impossible to see how she originally looked. She had a pair of dark eyes that only high-level zombies had, and her pale lips were pressed tightly together.</p> <p>She stood there straight in a long baggy dress which blurred her body shape, looking at him with composure in her eyes,</p> <p>The fact that this female zombie didn’t fiercely pounce on him or show any other sign of aggression made Huang Xiao feel strange. She hadn’t even extended her claws to overtly get ready for attack.</p> <p>It was worth mentioning that when human beings were hunting high-level zombies, the latter had also been hunting superpowered human beings. The same as human beings, zombies always acted in teams, because in a fight between one level-three zombie and a couple of superpowered human beings, the zombie’s chance of winning was incredibly low.</p> <p>At the moment, Huang Xiao was all alone as his teammates hadn’t caught up yet. Thanks to his superpower, he had left the rest of the squad far behind. For the high-level zombie standing in front of him, now was the best time to attack.</p> <p>If she were a regular zombie, she would have pounced on him right away. Therefore, Huang Xiao had left himself a space with a radius of nearly twenty meters to give himself the time and freedom for reaction.</p> <p>However, this zombie before his eyes didn’t attack him thirstily as he expected. Instead it just calmly stood there, quietly watching him.</p> <p>They had not begun fighting, so he couldn’t tell if this female zombie was at level three or four. He just guessed level-three based on her speed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly looked at this man for a while. She clearly knew that he was waiting for his teammates and didn’t want to start the fight right now, because she could sense some of this man’s thoughts. The distance between them was significant and his thoughts weren’t clear, yet she still sensed them.</p> <p>After knowing his thoughts, she was unwilling to wait with him and fall in a disadvantage. Hence, she turned back and darted away in her original direction.</p> <p>“Stop!” Seeing this female zombie turn back and run away, Huang Xiao inadvertently burst into a growl and lunged at her. He supported his legs with his wind power while wielding both arms to release a rapid wave of wind blades.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sharply sensed Huang Xiao’s attack. She nimbly dodged as the wind blades cut at her, then leaped up high in the air. Twisting her body for a few times midair, she flipped once before landing agilely back on the ground.</p> <p>She dodged more than ten of Huang Xiao’s wind blades which failed to even touch a corner of her clothing. Nevertheless, she was infuriated by this sudden attack.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Do you think zombies are all pushovers? Watch now as I kick your a*s! You think you’re the only bully, huh?’</em></p> <p>She popped out her claws while bending at the waist, then thrust her feet against the ground and pounced on Huang Xiao. She was so fast that she had rushed up to Huang Xiao with one swift move.</p> <p>By that point, Huang Xiao had inadvertently shortened the distance between Lin Qiao and himself while pursuing and attacking. As he was still feeling a little surprised about how this female zombie agilely moved her body and easily dodge all his wind blades, he saw her land back on the ground and suddenly charge at him. She was so fast that she even looked like a shred of a shadow. In a blink, she was right before his eyes.</p> <p><em>‘Not good!’ </em>Huang Xiao immediately realized that he had made a grave error as the sense of danger in his heart rose sharply and he hurriedly attempted to draw back.</p> <p>However, in his haste, he actually forgot to increase his speed with his wind power, managing to do nothing more than building a wind wall around his body. The wind wall lasted only about two seconds before Lin Qiao tore it down with her claws.</p> <p>Then, before Huang Xiao could figure out what was happening, he realized that he had suffered a few hits. In the next instant, he was flying in the air because Lin Qiao had kicked him away.</p> <p>After that, Huang Xiao rolled on the ground for a few times, then sat up and instinctively rubbed his arms in panic, checking his body for wounds.</p> <p>If he were wounded, he wouldn’t be able to escape his fate of becoming a zombie!</p> <p>He checked his entire body and found no scratch wound on his skin. The greatest pain came from his abdomen where he had suffered a heavy kick.</p> <p><em>‘No? No… No wound! Thank god!’</em></p> <p>Huang Xiao leaped up, scarcely able to believe his luck. As he prepared to recheck himself to see if he really hadn’t been wounded by the zombie, he suddenly felt cold and then saw some ragged clothes falling onto the ground around his feet.</p> <p>Then, he looked down at himself, only to see his exposed skin!</p> <p>Huang Xiao was stunned into silence.</p> <p><em>‘Damn!!!’</em></p> <p>He instinctively squeezed his legs together and covered the area below his lower abdomen with both hands as quickly as he could. Then, he lifted his head and looked around him in confusion.</p> <p>He saw no zombie, and only his late-arriving teammates.</p> <p>“Whoa! What the hell? Huang Xiao, what happened to you?”</p> <p>The rest of the squad was dumbfounded as the first thing they saw after arriving was Huang Xiao standing there naked! One of them couldn’t help but laugh out loud, then blurted out this question.</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! I really want a hole to crawl into!’ </em>Huang Xiao thought.</p> <p>The expression on Xie Dong’s face was hard to read as he gently made a fist and held it to his mouth, then coughed and said, “Eh-hem… You, lend some clothes to Huang Xiao for him to cover his body. Don’t just laugh!”</p> <p>He turned his face away while speaking, filled with embarrassment.</p> <p>Hearing him, the others finally came to their senses. One of them took off his jacket and threw it to Huang Xiao while still laughing.</p> <p>“Huang Xiao, have you been molested by someone?”</p>",
  "Chapter 23: A Foreboding of Danger": "<p>Huang Xiao’s face was flushed as he caught the jacket with one hand, then slightly turned and quickly wrapped it around his waist. His already red face darkened as he hissed through gritted teeth, “Not ‘some one’!”</p> <p>While speaking, he scanned the area but failed to find even a trace of that high-level female zombie. The others were shocked by his words, and one of them asked, “Not some one? It couldn’t have been some zombie, could it?”</p> <p>Huang Xiao didn’t know how to respond.</p> <p>Xie Dong finally threw out the question, “So then, where is this high-level zombie that you mentioned? There seems to be not a single zombie in this area, eh?”</p> <p>He looked around and found that this area was strangely empty. Leave alone high-level zombies, not even a regular zombie could be found here. The figures of zombies could only be seen hundreds of meters away from here.</p> <p>Huang Xiao did not concern himself with this. He moved suddenly and swiftly toward the regular zombies some distance away. He selected a relatively clean-looking male zombie and sliced off its head with a wind blade, then rushed up and ripped off its pants.</p> <p>Instead of being grateful toward Lin Qiao for not killing him, his teeth were clenched with hatred.</p> <p>She was just an intelligent zombie, but she had humiliated him so badly. How could he possibly let it go after being humiliated by a zombie like that? Next time he saw her, he would slice off her flesh, turn her into a skeleton, and then cut open her head to take out her nucleus.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Not far away from this squad of people, a lone figure stood in a corner on top of a dozen-story building, staring down at them. Its cold eyes sparkled with a desire to kill and a greed to feed.</p> <p>On the ground, Xie Dong’s heart skipped a beat as a strange sensation washed over him. He didn’t recognize this feeling, so he looked around in confusion but found nothing abnormal.</p> <p>On the other side of the road, Lin Qiao was hiding in another building, leaning against the wall next to a window with her back to Xie Dong and his teammates. Her eyes sparkled dimly as she glanced upward from the window.</p> <p>She sensed a strong vibe from the sixteenth floor of the building opposite, but she wasn’t the target of its owner. Clearly, this creature was coming for this group of living human beings.</p> <p>Although she knew that the vibe wasn’t meant for her, she still felt a strong sense of danger. It seemed that this creature was especially powerful. However, she couldn’t tell what it was based merely on the vibe. Was it a high-level zombie? A zombie beast? Or a mutant animal?</p> <p>Whatever it was, she felt that these people were in danger, because she knew that they were no match for that creature.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao was wondering what that creature would do next, she suddenly lost track of its vibe. She hurriedly fixed her eyes in that direction, but that dark silhouette was gone now, and so was its vibe, without leaving a trace. Her feeling of danger had faded, but it hadn’t disappeared entirely.</p> <p>While puzzling over this, she suddenly sensed a few other vibes and smells of human beings. No, not just a few… These smells belonged to many people and were all tangled up together.</p> <p>However, only a few among all the human vibes she sensed were powerful. Although, one of them even made her feel suppressed.</p> <p>No wonder that creature had hidden its own vibe or left temporarily. It couldn’t defeat this group of people who were now approaching this area. That was it, a group of people was coming in this direction.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took the opportunity to leave as well while the group was still some distance away. She quietly sneaked away from the area where nobody was present.</p> <p>Not long after she left, a group of people showed up from afar.</p> <p>“Look! That looks like a zombie-hunting army from the base.” Xie Dong’s people had spotted the gradually emerging army as well.</p> <p>“Looks like it.”</p> <p>“Yeah! The army out here for hunting zombies and collecting resources is led by Wu Chengyue this time. That should be them.”</p> <p>“Let’s go. No high-level zombie is in this area anymore. Even if there is one, we won’t get a chance to kill it now that they’re here.” Wearing a pair of pants snatched off a zombie, Huang Xiao looked at the army which was coming this way, his face filled with fear and jealousy.</p> <p>Xie Dong shook his head and said, “No, we should follow them. It’ll be safer that way.”</p> <p>He now knew what had made his heart flip earlier on and had given him such a strange sensation. It was the kind of feeling of danger that people would experience when they were targeted by fierce beasts. He felt that his squad had already been targeted by a powerful zombie, which could well be the one that had led them here.</p> <p>Therefore, as the zombie-hunting army from the base was passing by, the squad could follow them for a while. There were some powerful members in that army—many of them were at level-four, and a couple of them were even at level-five. Furthermore, as one of the leaders of the base, Wu Chengyue surely possessed a high-level superpower. In the Sea City Base, only three level-seven superpowered human beings existed after all.</p> <p>Together, these three level-seven powerful beings controlled the entire Sea City Base.</p> <p>Because of the characteristic wisdom, as well as learning and adaptive abilities of human beings, the human survivors had been growing stronger at quite a steady rate since the apocalyptic era began.</p> <p>Not only had the strongest superpowered human beings from the Sea City Base achieved level-seven, but the leaders of many other bases were also mostly at level-seven or above. This post-apocalyptic world was dominated by zombies. Therefore, a primitive hierarchy was naturally formed, according to which, the powerful ones commanded respect.</p> <p>Hearing Xie Dong, Huang Xiao immediately knitted his brows and said, “Follow them? What can we possibly get by following them? They might even use us as cannon fodder and make us defend against zombies for them.”</p> <p>He surely didn’t want to go with the powerful ones in the army, because he knew that those people would claim all high-level zombies which could be found. In that case, what would be left for them? At the very most, they would end up helping the army in dealing with some average level one to two zombies. However, the nuclei of those zombies were hardly valuable.</p> <p>He came out of the base for an adventure to win riches and honor. How could one make a harvest without taking the risk? If so, they didn’t need to form a zombie-hunting squad to hunt zombies outside then.</p> <p>Besides, if they joined this army, they would be required to hand over all the resources they had gained in the action except for zombies nuclei.</p> <p>Xie Dong felt that Huang Xiao’s words did make sense, but he also knew that the situation had changed. Earlier on, he had felt that his squad had been targeted, and he believed that to be true. After all, he was always exceptionally alert toward danger.</p> <p>Moreover, the enemy’s power was so mysterious that he couldn’t sense it at all. Without the feeling of danger in his heart, he wouldn’t have even known that his squad had already been targeted.</p> <p>Therefore, at this point, saving their own lives should be the top priority. If they were dead, all that they wanted would become meaningless.</p> <p>With a somber face, he said seriously, “I feel that we’ve been targeted. If we insist on acting by ourselves, we might encounter danger which won’t be easily overcome.”</p> <p>Huang Xiao tittered, mocking Xie Dong’s words, “You always say that you have sharp feelings. But look, we’ve been out here for so many days following you, yet have found nothing. Except for the great number of low-level zombies that we dealt with every day, we haven’t seen even a trace of any high-level zombie. Finally, I spotted one today, but we lost her because of your slow movements.”</p>",
  "Chapter 24: Independence or Dependence": "<p>While speaking, Huang Xiao signaled the others in the squad with his eyes.</p> <p>“Yeah Captain, the Deputy Captain is right. If we follow the army, we won’t get a thing. The zombie nuclei we’ll earn by hunting average zombies for them won’t be any more than we can get on our own.”</p> <p>“Exactly! Moreover, we have finally found a high-level zombie now. I don’t think she’s gone far. We might run into her again if we keep chasing. Why do we need to follow the army then?”</p> <p>“Besides, there are so many of us. If we find a level-three zombie, there’s no way we’ll let her get away. Even if we bump into a level-four one, we’ll still have a good chance against it. Even in the worst case, if we can’t defeat the zombie, can’t we just run? Perhaps, we can kill a level-four zombie by joining forces. If that happens, we would earn a fortune, wouldn’t we? That would be a bagful of rice and clean quilts!”</p> <p>“Right, right…” The few who had received Huang Xiao’s silent signals immediately joined the conversation to side with him.</p> <p>Xie Dong frowned and said with a frosty look, “None of us has ever encountered a level-four-zombie, and we have no idea how powerful they are. But, my feelings can’t be wrong.”</p> <p>“Captain, you yourself are a level-four being with a fire superpower. Are you still afraid of level-four zombies? That would be wrong!” Huang Xiao said smilingly. Although his expression was neutral, his eyes flashed with jealousy and hatred.</p> <p>“Yeah!”</p> <p>“Even though I’m at level-four, I’m still not sure that I can defeat a level-four zombie. Besides, I have heard that level-four superpowered human beings are no match for level-four zombies at all.” Looking at these people who seemed to be unmoved by his arguments, Xie Dong knitted his eyebrows with impatience.</p> <p>At that moment, Huang Xiao shrugged and said, “I don’t care. I won’t follow the army anyway. Besides, they may not allow us to join them.”</p> <p>Aside of from, if those in the army saw him in this state, they would laugh their heads off behind his back, wouldn’t they?</p> <p>Thinking about this finally got Huang Xiao’s feet moving. He then began walking in the other direction ahead of the others.</p> <p>Xie Dong glanced around at the others, noting that six or seven of the nine didn’t seem to be willing to listen to him. He then looked at the direction which Huang Xiao had gone to, having no choice but to sigh and nod.</p> <p>“Alright then. We leave this place now.”</p> <p>He surely knew that Huang Xiao had hostile feelings toward him. This time, ever since they left the base, the latter had been running opposite him, acting impulsively irrespective of the consequences.</p> <p>Of course, he had a lot of complaints about Huang Xiao, but as the Captain and the strongest one in the squad, he couldn’t do anything about it except protecting all his teammates like a nanny. He also needed to give consideration to the rest of the squad’s opinions. After all, if the squad members were at variance with each other, it could lead to dangerous infighting.</p> <p>Therefore, he had been trying to be patient with Huang Xiao’s reckless behavior all this while.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After they left, Wu Chengyue arrived with a formidable thousand-man army.</p> <p>In the front of the group were three modified and heavy off-road vehicles. These vehicles could not only defend against zombies’ claws, but could also knock down any zombie walls in their way. In the apocalyptic era, all vehicles were reinforced with layers of giant metal thorns on the front, which jutted out like huge nails.</p> <p>When these vehicles collided with zombie walls, blood and meat pieces would splash across the sky. Nothing could stop these vehicles.</p> <p>Behind these off-road vehicles were a few heavy, green colored army trucks, also modified for practicality in this zombie infested world.</p> <p>The motorcade stopped in the area where Xie Dong and his squad had been standing a while ago. An extra tall and strong man came out of the first vehicle, followed by a few men and a squad of soldiers.</p> <p>These soldiers cleared off the surrounding zombies and turned this area into an empty place once they got off the vehicle.</p> <p>The tall and strong man stood in the front, his sharp eyes scanning the surrounding area. His eyes paused briefly on where Xie Dong and his squad had recently been standing, then moved away.</p> <p>At this time, a man appeared from behind them. He was shorter than the man in the front, but his body shape could still be described as tall and straight. The expression on his handsome face was quite mild. His eyes contained the faintest hint of a smile, and the corners of his lips were on the verge of curving. It was such that the others couldn’t tell if he was smiling or not.</p> <p>This man looked gentle, warm, and humble. However, the camouflage clothing that he was wearing slightly cut down his gentle warmth and gave him a serious, soldier-like presence.</p> <p>At this very moment, no one could detect the fierceness that he had shown the last time because of Lu Tianyu. However, his brows were still drawing slightly together in a frown, showing a worried look.</p> <p>“It left fast, or we would have bagged ourselves another level-four zombie nucleus,” he said while sighing slightly.</p> <p>The tall and strong man turned around and glanced at him, then snorted coldly and said, “That zombie-hunting squad probably didn’t even know what had targeted them. One level-four, one level-three, and four level-two superpowered human beings, along with a few ordinary ones… Hmm… In front of a level-four zombie, a squad like this is just a food delivery service. I thought they’d smartly follow us once they saw us, but it seems that they’re a bunch of idiots.”</p> <p>Wu Yuecheng slightly turned up his mouth corners, but the glimmer of a smile in his eyes wasn’t brightening. He said, “They left the base to risk their lives for a better life. People’s desires are just like this. The more they want something, the more they are willing to risk to get it.”</p> <p>The tall and strong man nodded in agreement, then turned around and shouted at the dozen or so level-four superpowered soldiers behind him, “Squad one to five, take your people and search the surrounding area for signs of Ling Ling. Squad six to ten, search for high-level zombies and hunt them down… Move!”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” From amongst the dozens of people behind him, ten immediately stood in attention and responded before turning to carry out their orders. They gathered their people and leaped into action straightaway.</p> <p>At that moment, a young woman got off the vehicle a little anxiously. She looked to be about twenty years old, but was twenty-three in fact. She had a magical vibe about her that belonged to the forests.</p> <p>She wasn’t gorgeous, but wasn’t ugly either. She could be counted as pretty, like a pretty girl next door. Her face was clean, and her watery eyes were quite clear.</p> <p>This woman was Wu Chengyue’s Deputy Commander, and her name was Meng Yue, a level-five with botanical power.</p> <p>With an anxious look, Meng Yue strode over to Wu Chengyue, then grabbed his arm and said, “Brother Yue, I sense it! Ling is nearby! The feeling is weak, but it’s there.”</p> <p>The two men both changed their expressions when they heard her words. The faint smile on Wu Chengyue’s face faded as he stared at Meng Yue nervously, asking anxiously and excitedly, “Where? Where? Yue, have you sensed Ling Ling’s location?”</p> <p>If Meng Yue hadn’t been confirming that Ling Ling was alright, Wu Chengyue wouldn’t have been able to remain as calm as he was right now. When he heard Meng Yue say that she had sensed his daughter, his restrained vibe was suddenly stirred as he became agitated.</p> <p>Meng Yue closed her eyes and sank into her sensation with a serious look. Suddenly, she opened her eyes as a beam of light flashed across them while she pointed in a direction and said, “That way.”</p> <p>Next, she felt two figures flash by as the two men in front of her disappeared without a trace.</p>",
  "Chapter 25: Suddenly Struck by Lightning": "<p>On the other side, Ling Qiao had taken a detour and was running toward the strawberry field. She didn’t know that the little one’s father was in that large troop of people.</p> <p>At that moment, she was struggling with one difficult issue—how to persuade the little one to eat some strawberries?</p> <p>Apart from the abnormal color of the strawberry, the little one’s parents had no doubt taught her not to eat things outside. Furthermore, the strawberry had a horrible odor. Although the odor disappeared later on, Lin Qiao didn’t know if that was because of losing its freshness after a while or having been washed with the lake water in her space.</p> <p>The little one was willing to drink the water that she offered, but Lin Qiao wasn’t sure if she would be willing to eat the strawberries that she provided.</p> <p>As she mulled this over, Lin Qiao ran faster toward the strawberry field. However, before she could get far, she was held up again.</p> <p>Looking at the series of steel thorns which suddenly appeared floating in the air while pointing at her, Lin Qiao had no choice but to stop.</p> <p>“Why is it a zombie?” A confused voice arose behind her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently turned her head and saw two tall men standing no more than five meters behind her. She hadn’t sensed their approach at all.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s dark eyes sparkled as she recognized Wu Chengyue. She really wanted to enter her space right now and bring out the little one, then directly throw her to the ground and run away. However, the problem was that she didn’t seem capable of running away under the eyes of these two men. The best she could hope for was enter her space again and hide in there without coming back out.</p> <p>And once she brought out the little one, these two might directly make their move.</p> <p>While she was frozen with indecision, on the other side, Xiao Yunlong had already made a direct move.</p> <p>Ling Qiao sensed a sharp coldness run through her entire body. Before she realized what had happened, her body had instinctively reacted. She suddenly thrust her feet against the ground and nimbly flipped in the air before landing lightly back on the ground after a series of metal thorns stuck into the ground.</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! They didn’t even greet, attacking straightaway! There’s no room for negotiation here!’ </em>Lin Qiao cursed silently, her facial expression turning a little ferocious as she got angry.</p> <p>“Roar!” She bared her teeth and growled at the two men.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue watched her move with surprise, then said to Xiao Yunlong, “She doesn’t seem like an average level-three intelligent zombie. She reacted quickly, and actually dodged your attack.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong raised his eyebrows and responded, also with a trace of surprise in his eyes, “She’s mad.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao now realized that she must be looking as strange as a real zombie, so she hurriedly relaxed her expression, but couldn’t help rolling her eyes after hearing Xiao Yunlong’s words.</p> <p>She twitched her nose toward the two men. They smelled so good! The blood and flesh of high-level superpowered human beings had been washed by energies, and seemed quite pure and delicious.</p> <p>However, due to the strong vibes that she sensed from these two men, Lin Qiao only dared to sneakily steal a few sniffs.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned his head to look around. His attention wasn’t focused on this zombie in front of him. All he wanted was to locate his daughter as soon as possible.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong had been staring at Lin Qiao the whole time, so he clearly saw her roll her eyes. Those eyes were pure black, but he somehow recognized the eye-rolling from her expression. Then, he saw this female zombie sneakily sniff toward him with the unmistakable hunger in the gesture. Xiao Yunlong grasped all these details with his eyes.</p> <p>He felt that there was something different about this zombie, so he stared at Lin Qiao with interest.</p> <p>For some reason, Lin Qiao was unable to read the minds of these two men. It was probably because they were way too strong and their powers had blocked her sensation.</p> <p>She didn’t dare to make any moves, feeling her scalp turn numb as this tall man in front of her kept gazing at her. She was afraid that if she moved even slightly, the two men would directly destroy her. She wasn’t strong enough to defeat them, so she had to stay humble.</p> <p>She couldn’t bring a person out of her space with just her mind. The only way that she could do this was to go inside and then bring that person back out with her. She thought it might be because her energy level was not high enough yet for achieving that stage of development. However, she believed that when her energy and level had both improved, she should be able to directly control things in her space with her mind.</p> <p>She could faintly sense this aspect of her powers.</p> <p>Right at this moment, Meng Yue arrived on the scene.</p> <p>She looked at Lin Qiao up and down with surprise, then blurted out, “Strange! How can it be a zombie? Brother Yue, she has Ling Ling’s smell!”</p> <p>On hearing this, Wu Chengyue’s expression changed immediately. Sharp frosty lights shot from his eyes toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was startled by Meng Yue’s words. Before she could figure out how this woman could smell Wu Yueling’s from her body, a strong sense of danger suddenly rose in her heart and shivers raced down her spine.</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>A purple lightning bolt descended from the sky and struck on Lin Qiao’s head within a blink of an eye! At the same time, a scream could also be heard.</p> <p>“Brother Yue, no!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao had no time to dodge. By the time she realized what was happening, the lightning bolt had already landed on her head. Her whole body quivered and then she felt it turn numb and stiff. Although she couldn’t feel any pain, she was disabled from moving.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a strong burnt smell surrounded her body.</p> <p>Meng Yue angrily grabbed Wu Chengyue’s arm and said, “Brother Yue! What are you doing? How am I supposed to detect Ling Ling’s vibe if you kill her?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled at her and said, “Don’t worry. I have my power controlled. I won’t kill her. I just temporarily disabled her.”</p> <p>Meng Yue sighed in relief. She had been afraid that Wu Chengyue was too emotional and might strike the zombie into ash.</p> <p>“Roar!” Lin Qiao finally recovered from the numbness and she let out a roar of rage.</p> <p>Being struck by lightning felt really bad. Fortunately, she had a zombie body. Otherwise, the pain would have killed her, wouldn’t it? Yet, being struck by lightning wasn’t much fun even for a zombie.</p> <p>She was dazzled and light-headed. Her body didn’t suffer much pain, but was disabled from moving. She had also been sensing waves of dull pain radiating from her chest, restricting her imaginary breath.</p> <p>This dull pain in her chest seemed to come all the way from her soul, making her feel extremely uncomfortable.</p> <p>Damn! All she wanted to do was to give the little one back to this man, but he attacked her with lightning just like that! In that instant, she made up her mind—she wouldn’t give the little one back!</p> <p>The moment this thought occurred to her, Lin Qiao roared angrily at the three people, then suddenly flashed across the air and disappeared, leaving the three dumbfounded people staring at the spot where she had disappeared from.</p> <p>“She… Why is she gone?” Meng Yue widened her eyes, staring straight ahead in confusion.</p> <p>“Space power?” Xiao Yunlong knitted his eyebrows as well.</p> <p>“She’s a level-four zombie!” Wu Chengyue’s face darkened slightly.</p> <p>The three of them had actually let a level-four zombie disappear right before their faces. Or rather, the zombie had gotten away from them!</p> <p>Meng Yue now realized what had happened too. Suddenly, her eyes shone as she said, “So, Ling Ling is actually in her space!”</p>",
  "Chapter 26: The Vanished Zombie": "<p>Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong looked back at her, their eyes reflecting the same thought.</p> <p>Meng Yue now said with a sudden understanding, “No wonder my reaction to the seed is so weak. It turns out that we are separated by a space. Fortunately, her level isn’t high. If she was at a slightly higher level, I might not be able to have even this weak sensation.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong suddenly smiled at Wu Chengue and said, “See, you struck her away! Now, how do you propose we find her? Her space should be mobile. When she comes out again, she might be in a different place.”</p> <p>Hearing him, Wu Chengyue’s face darkened even further and turned a little sour. His mild expression was nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>At that point, Meng Yue glared at Xiao Yunlong and said angrily, “Why are you so happy? Aren’t you worried about Ling Ling? What if that zombie has been keeping Ling Ling as a food supply? Now that you two have rattled her cage, what will we do if she gets mad and eats Ling Ling once she enters her space?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong shrugged and said, “I didn’t make a move! I wonder if you realized that this zombie is a little different from other high-level zombies.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t respond, only looking at him.</p> <p>Meng Yue asked with surprise, “What’s different about her?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong said, “High-level zombies have intelligence. Their behaviors are almost the same as the behaviors of human beings because they have learned it by mimicking human beings. But just now, I observed that zombie and noted that she didn’t have the hostility that the other zombies all have. Besides, some of her human-like actions were very natural, nothing like an imitation.”</p> <p>No hostility… This meant that the zombie hadn’t killed or eaten human beings. However, as a zombie, how could she possibly not eat or kill human beings, particularly as a high-level zombie.</p> <p>She didn’t eat human beings, which meant she wouldn’t eat Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Once he said this, the other two fell silent.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gazed at the spot where Lin Qiao had disappeared and replayed the encounter in his head. He now realized that he truly hadn’t sensed any hostility from that female zombie earlier on.</p> <p>Was that a zombie which wouldn’t kill human beings?</p> <p>“How come? What kind of zombie doesn’t kill human beings? Human beings are their food source, and once zombies see human beings, they will instinctively pounce upon and eat them. It’s some kind of bestial, instinctive appetite, and it can never change.” Meng Yue said in disbelief,</p> <p>Even though she said this, she showed doubt in her eyes as she had detected no fierce hostility from the female zombie’s vibe either. She had a nature-based power, so she was many times more sensitive to vibes than the two men beside her.</p> <p>However, she still couldn’t believe that.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong again suggested, “Perhaps, that female zombie was helping Ling Ling in finding her parents. She may not know that it’s you who she has been looking for. But, as she has suffered a strike from you, I think that even if she finds out your identity as Ling Ling’s father someday, she may not want to give her back to you anymore.”</p> <p>Hearing him, Wu Chengyue instantly felt embarrassed for some reason.</p> <p>Even though he knew that what Xiao Yunlong said could never happen to a zombie that had lost its humanity, he subconsciously preferred to believe that this was a miracle. Perhaps, his daughter was still alive and well in that zombie’s space.</p> <p>“Besides, didn’t you notice that she had no intention of attacking? I was going to play with her, but she was struck by you and got scared away.” Xiao Yunlong continued while sighing regretfully.</p> <p>Looking at Wu Chengyue’s constantly darkening face, Meng Yue couldn’t help but say to Xiao Yunlong, “Alright, you can quit talking. Now, in any case, we need to find that zombie before we can find Ling Ling.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong nodded and said, “It seems to be the only way. I’ll send some people to carefully search the area for miles around.”</p> <p>Meng Yue nodded in agreement, “Let’s do this for now. I’ll go back and bring some people to encamp in this area. Perhaps, that zombie didn’t actually leave. When she comes out, we’ll be ready to stop her.”</p> <p>After having finished talking, the two of them jumped into action and left Wu Chengyue staying put.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao flashed into her space. Once inside, she fell to the ground along with a puffing noise, then lay on the ground without moving. The burnt smell on her body immediately spread in the space, dissolving in the air.</p> <p>Once she showed up in the space, Wu Yueling sensed her presence and then saw her lying motionlessly in the clearing by the lake, with her whole body burned back.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was shocked as she looked at Lin Qiao in confusion, wondering what had happened to this zombie.</p> <p>She felt that Lin Qiao’s look was a little familiar. This zombie here looked like those zombies which were vanquished by her dad’s superpower. When her dad struck people with lightning, the ones who suffered the strikes would look just like this.</p> <p>However, because Wu Chengyue had never struck anyone into ashes in front of her, she didn’t know that her dad was actually able to strike human beings or zombies straight into nothingness with just one bolt of lightning.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was afraid that it might traumatize his daughter, so he had never launched a fierce attack in front of her.</p> <p>For some reason, Wu Yueling felt a little uneasy when she saw Lin Qiao in such a state. She was afraid that the latter would die like this. What would she do if the latter died?</p> <p>She didn’t know exactly what this place was, but she had been here for so long now. In this place, except for the grassland and a small lake, the rest was a vast expanse of whiteness, and she could see nothing clearly. She didn’t know how to get out, and no one else existed in this place.</p> <p>She had once tried to approach the edge of the white mist, but couldn’t see anything clearly even while standing in front of it. So, she dared not to go any further in. For this reason, she had stayed by the lake and in the grass all this while.</p> <p>The only creatures she had seen in this place were this zombie, who wouldn’t hurt her, and that rabbit which had shown up earlier. The rabbit ran into the grass and disappeared after being released by the zombie earlier on. This zombie made a grass dragonfly for her to play with, and fetched some water for her to drink. When the zombie wasn’t here, she had gone to the lakeside by herself to drink with the grass funnel that the zombie had left for her.</p> <p>She was quite delighted when she saw the zombie return. However, on seeing the latter in this seemingly bad condition, her delight turned into concern.</p> <p>Even though she didn’t really understand the concept of worry yet, she didn’t like seeing the zombie like this.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao show up but lying movelessly on the ground, Wu Yueling immediately ran over and peered at her from about three meters away. After looking at her for a while and noting that she still wasn’t moving, Wu Yueling slowly put out a foot to take a step, and then another step.</p> <p>She carefully inched her way closer to Lin Qiao, circling up to a step away from her and then stopping again.</p> <p>Although this zombie had been acting harmless to her, she was still afraid that this zombie would suddenly leap up and run her down.</p> <p>She paused by Lin Qiao’s side for a while. When she saw this zombie simply keep her eyes closed without making any reaction, she slowly squatted, intending to take a closer look at her face.</p> <p><em>‘What happened to her? Why doesn’t she get up? How long will she sleep before she wakes up?’</em></p> <p>The little Wu Yueling couldn’t figure out why, and could only wait for Lin Qiao to wake up.</p>",
  "Chapter 27: Eased Relationship": "<p>Even after waiting for quite a long while, Wu Yueling still saw no reaction from Lin Qiao. Hence, she felt a bit strange, wondering why this would happen.</p> <p>While thinking, she suddenly and unconsciously reached out a hand, gently pushing Lin Qiao’s shoulder.</p> <p><em>‘Wake up! Wake up!’</em></p> <p>She pushed a few times, but Lin Qiao still didn’t open her eyes. She didn’t know what to do at this point. Unsure of herself, she stood up and turned around, then suddenly saw the lake water.</p> <p><em>‘Right! I’ll give her some lake water.’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling remembered that she herself was hungry and thirsty before, feeling utterly uncomfortable. The zombie had given her some water, and after drinking it, she had felt much better. Although she was still very hungry, her stomach no longer ached.</p> <p>Thinking of this, Wu Yueling ran to the lakeside with the grass funnel that Lin Qiao had woven for her earlier and awkwardly fetched some water. Then, she carefully carried it to Lin Qiao and slowly poured the water into Lin Qiao’s mouth after squatting down.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao didn’t open her mouth to let Wu Yueling pour the water into it. Instead, the water flowed onto the ground from Lin Qiao’s cracked lips.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Wu Yueling wasn’t discouraged. She stood back up and ran to the lakeside to fetch some more water, then tried again to pour it into Lin Qiao’s mouth. Right at that moment, she saw that the zombie had slightly opened her mouth and drank some of it.</p> <p>Seeing this, Wu Yueling immediately felt delighted.</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened her eyes slightly and glanced at the kid with her pure black eyes. In fact, she hadn’t fainted, but had suffered a severe tightness in the chest which made her very uncomfortable. She kept her eyes closed the whole time, enduring the uncomfortable feeling and waiting for it to fade.</p> <p>She was surprised because she could not have anticipated Wu Yueling to actually worry about her, and fetch some water for her to drink.</p> <p>She could read the little one’s mind. She sighed slightly in relief, because she knew that this little one had finally accepted her.</p> <p>In reality, she understood that Wu Yueling accepted her like this only because she was afraid of being here alone. Children wanted company after all. Even though Wu Yueling had autism, she still wanted to stay with someone when stuck in a strange environment.</p> <p>Lin Qiao tried to move her fingers and found that although her body was stiff, she could still manage to move.</p> <p>She put her forearms onto the ground to support her body, then slowly sat up while looking at Wu Yueling, whose eyes sparkled brightly even though her expression was blank.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao wake up, Wu Yueling immediately backed away. She only retreated to about three meters though, then picked up her blanket and wrapped herself up again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Wu Yueling, then lowered her head to look down at her own clothes. As she had imagined, her clothes were already ragged. Many parts of her clothes were burnt, leaving only a few rags hanging on her.</p> <p>She raised her hands to touch her own head, then turned to look at her shoulders. As she expected, her hair had curled up wildly. She then looked at her arms, thighs, and other exposed body areas, finding that her bluish-gray skin had been burnt black.</p> <p>She raised her head and glance at Wu Yueling again. She couldn’t help feeling a little angry at the little one as her dad was the one who had done all this. He had actually struck her with lightning!</p> <p>She could barely stand up now, so how was she supposed to take the kid out of the space? Besides, she dared not to go out yet. What if Wu Chengyue and his people were guarding out there? In that case, she would be walking right into their trap by showing her face, wouldn’t she?</p> <p>However, she couldn’t leave this location without going out or monitor the outside situation from within her space.</p> <p>She struggled to find a solution and realized that she temporarily had no way of getting out. She wondered if she could send Wu Yueling out from inside the space. However, as she didn’t know the outside situation, she couldn’t know if Wu Chengyue and his people were gone, or if zombies were present there now. How could she send Wu Yueling out under such uncertain circumstances?</p> <p>Thinking of this, Lin Qiao gave Wu Yueling another stare, and found that this little one seemed to be in a weird condition.</p> <p>How come this little one was looking more and more energetic? She hadn’t eaten all this while, but why had the ruddy color come back to her cheeks?</p> <p>But soon, her thoughts were distracted from Wu Yueling by the waves of burnt smell which made her a little dizzy. Reminded by the smell, she thought of her current look. She couldn’t stay like this. She had to take a bath in the lake to remove the smell from her body first. Moreover, what should she do with her hair?</p> <p>Zombie hair were already dead and dry. To make matters worse, her hair had become scorched and frizzy after being struck by lightning. She might as well cut her hair as it was useless in keeping them.</p> <p>After making up her mind, she struggled up to her feet. Trying to control her stiff legs, she then shambled to the lakeside, ripping off her clothes with her claws while walking.</p> <p>It didn’t take much of her strength to take off her ragged clothes. She simply pulled at them and the clothes fell into pieces, exposing her burnt, black body, as well as the cloth strips that were wrapped around her waist.</p> <p>Before she stripped naked in front of the child, Lin Qiao turned around and glanced at Wu Yueling. She found that the kid had actually covered her eyes with her hands, as though she couldn’t bear to watch.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was amused as she looked away and unwrapped the cloth strips from her waist.</p> <p>Looking at the hole in her stomach, she found that it had also been burnt black. The black hole hollowed in her belly, such that she couldn’t even see her intestines and other organs clearly.</p> <p>She raised her head and looked at the lake surface as she walked deep into the water step by step. Nothing had happened to Wu Yueling since she drank the water from this lake. Based on this fact, Lin Qiao could assume that the lake water was safe. She wondered if her zombie virus had failed to affect the lake water earlier on when she bathed in the lake, or if it’s effect was just too minor to cause any harm.</p> <p>She couldn’t think of so much at the moment. In the worst case scenario, she would go to the other side of the lake when she wanted to drink the water next time.</p> <p>After going into the water, she walked deeper and deeper until the water reached her chest. She stood in the water and slowly scrubbed her black skin, feeling her body being soothed by the cool water.</p> <p>She wasn’t moving fast, as her body wouldn’t allow it. When she had finally washed all reachable body areas and was preparing to go back ashore, she paused for a second. Her clothes had been torn into pieces, and would no longer cover her body!</p> <p>What was she supposed to wear now? She wondered if the little one would be willing to lend her the blanket that she had been wrapping her own body with if she requested to borrow it.</p> <p>She felt acutely uncomfortable thinking of being naked even inside her space.</p> <p>Was she upgrading herself into a pervert zombie now?</p> <p>At this point, Lin Qiao finally thought of this. Her face darkened, even though it was already burnt black by the lightning.</p> <p>If she had known that she would be in dire need of clothes, she would have conveniently searched for some and stored them in her space after killing that intelligent zombie. Yet now, she didn’t even have a single piece of cloth to cover her body.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was such a b*stard!</p> <p>Maybe her anger was too strong or for other reasons, Wu Yueling actually sensed her thoughts from the short distance.</p> <p>Wu Yueling now knew that this zombie wanted her blanket, and also understood that the clothes which had been thrown to the ground by the zombie were definitely no longer wearable.</p> <p>So, she ran over while holding her blanket. Then, she threw it to the lakeside and turned around, running far away again while leaving Lin Qiao speechless.</p>",
  "Chapter 28: The Images in her head": "<p>Lin Qiao watched Wu Yueling throw the blanket to the ground and then swiftly run away with surprise, not knowing what to say.</p> <p>This little one was quite smart, as well as caring, wasn’t she?</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently walked ashore, bending over with difficulty to pick up the blanket. She carried the blanket as she popped out her claw and cut through it a few times. The small blanket was soon cut into two, and she wrapped her body with one half to cover her damaged chest and black stomach. Then, she directly made a wrap-around skirt with the other half.</p> <p>Wearing these temporary clothes made from the blanket, Lin Qiao finally sighed in relief and then smiled at Wu Yueling from the distance.</p> <p>Wu Yueling immediately turned around and ran backward for a few steps after seeing her horrible smile.</p> <p><em>Lin </em>Qiao couldn’t think of anything to say anymore.</p> <p><em>‘Alright, so my current look is indeed a little unacceptable… But, my little friend, can you not overreact?’</em></p> <p>Just then, Wu Yueling seemed to have feared that Lin Qiao might die after all!</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned around and walked to the lakeside, then slowly squatted there. Fortunately, even though her body was still stiff, her joints were supple enough to allow her to bend her limbs. However, she couldn’t move too fast, or her stiff body would seize up altogether and she wouldn’t be able to move at all.</p> <p>She looked at her own reflection on the lake surface. Her hairs were scruffy and frizzy, with her facial features not so clearly visible underneath them. She swept her hair behind her head to expose her entire face.</p> <p>She didn’t know when it had happened, but the wounds on her face had healed, leaving large, dark-brown colored scars on her cheeks. Her pure black, weird eyes were shining.</p> <p>She looked horrible indeed!</p> <p>She smiled, causing the wounds on her face to twist, looking grotesque. No wonder the little one ran away once she saw her smiling.</p> <p>Lin Qiao imagined how terrified the child must have felt on seeing her smiling face.</p> <p>She looked horrible with her face covered by hair, but even worse when she exposed her visage. It was obviously better to keep her face covered.</p> <p>She slowly stood up and walked to the edge of the grass, then found a relatively clean spot to sit down.</p> <p>At this moment, she had a good deal of things to figure out. Looking at Wu Yueling, who stood a short distance away, she wondered whether it was her space that had been allowing this child to slowly turn for the better. After all, even though the child hadn’t been eating, she didn’t seem about to starve to death.</p> <p>That was very abnormal!</p> <p>Was time standing still in her space? It shouldn’t be. Judging from the growth of the grasses in here, time had been moving steadily in this place. Was it because of the water? Was the little one’s hunger eased by the lake water that she drank? However, the lake water couldn’t possibly restore her body functions too, could it?</p> <p>She felt that this space was very mysterious, and she didn’t know what all kind of special effects the lake water might deliver. She herself had drunk quite some water from this lake as well.</p> <p><em>‘Right!’ </em>Lin Qiao suddenly recalled that when she entered this space for the first time, she soaked herself in the lake and fell asleep. She didn’t know how long she slept for, but after she woke up, her body had become flexible. At that time, she hadn’t noticed that it was because of the lake water, and thought of it as a natural change of her body.</p> <p>She now thought it over and figured that it could be the effect of the lake water!</p> <p>The lake water seemed to be able to help in increasing her zombie level!</p> <p>With this thought, Lin Qiao felt delighted. This space really seemed to be a treasure that she had been gifted with after coming back to life.</p> <p>Earlier on, the mutant strawberry’s unpleasant odor disappeared after it was washed in the lake. Could the lake water also serve the function of odor removal?</p> <p>After figuring this out, Lin Qiao was much less unhappy. But then, she glanced at Wu Yueling and said to herself in her heart with anger, <em>‘I was going to send her back to that man. But now, I will not! I have changed my mind!’</em></p> <p>Who said that Wu Chengyue was a nice man? Who said that he was a gentle and kind person? He was clearly a smiling tiger! Without warning, he had struck her with lightning directly! She would remember this for sure! Even though Lu Tianyu had raped him… Lu Tianyu was already dead, and she, Lin Qiao, had nothing to do with her!</p> <p>However, how should she get out now? She didn’t know anything about the situation outside. She had no way to find out if there were people guarding out there.</p> <p>If only she could read the minds of the people on the outside from inside her space… That way, she would also be able to find out if there were people out there.</p> <p>Lin Qiao tried to close her eyes in order to listen and feel.</p> <p>When she closed her eyes and tried hard to sense, a hazy image suddenly popped up inside her brain. The image was familiar, as it was the spot where she had entered the space from.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? How can this happen?’</em></p> <p>She opened her eyes and the image immediately disappeared from her mind right away. Deep confusion clouded her eyes before she closed them again.</p> <p>As she had expected, once she closed her eyes and thought about the outside situation, the image appeared in her mind once again, even more clearly than before. However, the image was colorless, as though composed of a series of black, white, and gray shadows. The range of the image had started expanding as well, and she could now see some human figures.</p> <p>These people were in camouflage clothing, and their faces were all clean. They all carried guns, and were walking casually around the surrounding area. These were clearly human beings, not zombies.</p> <p>Apart from the image that she had been seeing in her head, Lin Qiao couldn’t sense any vibe. However, she knew that this must be a true depiction of the current situation outside.</p> <p>That was already enough!</p> <p>She could see an army station not too far away. It was a temporary station, but she knew for sure that this army was the one that Wu Chengyue had been leading.</p> <p>The zombies in this area had been basically eradicated, as Lin Qiao didn’t see even a single one of them.</p> <p>As her eyeballs rolled under her eyelids, the image changed. She looked from left to right and noticed that it was now nightfall outside.</p> <p>Some soldiers in their camouflage clothing were patrolling while others were sitting to the side, gathered in groups of two or three.</p> <p>As she had thought, Wu Chengyue had people stationed in this area. Under these circumstances, how could she sneak out? Facing so many people, she would be encircled the moment she showed up, wouldn’t she?</p> <p>Lin Qiao pondered over it as she observed the outside situation with a sour face. Sadly, she couldn’t read the minds of those people. Otherwise, she might have been able to learn more about the situation and prepare accordingly.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and the images of the outside world in her head all disappeared. As though her eyes were a switch, she could see the situation outside once she closed them, and once opened, the connection between her and the outside world would be cut off.</p> <p>She turned around and suddenly saw Wu Yueling, who had sneakily moved to her side and was silently looking at her from less than half a meter away without attracting her attention.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao’s eyes opened, Wu Yueling widened her own eyes and moved her feet. She instinctively wanted to run, but her foot drew back midway and she continued standing there while looking at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>She was still a little afraid of Lin Qiao, but she couldn’t resist wanting to stay by her side.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her. She was reluctant to move, so she continued sitting on the ground to rest. For some reason, after observing the outside situation twice, she felt quite weary, such that her whole body felt listless. She didn’t feel this tiredness physically, but mentally.</p>",
  "Chapter 29: Moving in A Dream": "<p>She sat there and fell asleep, getting lost in a dream. In her dream, she exited the space but none of the surrounding people discovered her, as if she was invisible. Then, she broke into a run, her movements smooth and her feet flexible.</p> <p>She kept running toward the strawberry field. She didn’t know for how long she ran before she saw the strawberry field.</p> <p>In the next moment, she woke up with a start. Opening her eyes, she looked around and found herself still in the space. She thought that maybe she had such a dream because she wanted so much to leave this location. However, she also felt that it all seemed quite strange.</p> <p>Did normal zombies dream?</p> <p>She also found that she was still sitting on the ground with her legs crossed. It was so weird that she could even manage to fall asleep while sitting upright in a meditation posture.</p> <p>She felt a little thirsty as she glanced at Wu Yueling, who was sitting beside her. The child had found some hay from an unknown source and paved the ground with a thick layer of it. She was now sitting on it, playing with the grass dragonfly that Lin Qiao had made for her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stretched her legs and felt that they were still quite stiff. And for an unknown reason, she also sensed a faint pain from them.</p> <p>With a great effort, she finally stood up from the ground, then slowly walked to the lake. Recalling that this was the place where she took a bath earlier on, she walked around the lake to the other side.</p> <p>She turned back and glanced at Wu Yueling, who was walking behind her, feeling that this kid was becoming a little dependent on her.</p> <p>She walked very slowly. Her legs were a little heavy and sore, so she took each step with some difficulty.</p> <p>She paid close attention to her steps and the lake water while pondering over the question of why a zombie might dream. What she didn’t think about was why her legs were sore. Logically speaking, she was a zombie, and shouldn’t have any sensations at all.</p> <p>If she had discovered this, she might have realized that some unimaginable changes had happened to her body again, but she didn’t.</p> <p>After spending half an hour, she finally reached another side of the lake where she stopped and slowly squatted near the water. Then, she directly cupped her hands to drink from the lake. After taking quite a few gulps, she finally felt her energy begin to return.</p> <p>Having finished drinking, she took a few steps backward, standing by the lake with her eyes closed as she wanted to see if there were still people out there.</p> <p>But this time, the image which emerged in her mind didn’t come from the same spot that she had entered her space from.</p> <p>She hurriedly opened her eyes, which reflected her uncertainty, and then immediately closed them again. As she expected, she still couldn’t see the urban area where she had entered the space from, and instead saw a strawberry field.</p> <p>A mutant strawberry field!</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened her eyes again, lost in her confusion. She couldn’t understand why she was able to see the strawberry field.</p> <p>Had she been wrong earlier? Was her vision not limited to the place that she entered the space from? Could she actually see whichever place she wanted to go to?</p> <p>With this thought in mind, she closed her eyes once again to try and see the location of those soldiers whom she had observed before, but saw nothing. Inside her mind was still the same strawberry field that she had been to before.</p> <p>How could this happen? Had she left her old location already?</p> <p>Was this just her imagination? If she went out now, would she still reappear in that place which was guarded by Wu Chengyue and his people?</p> <p>She thought that it was probable, but the image in her mind was rather clear. The moon was hanging in the sky, showing that it was the middle of the night right now.</p> <p>Had she truly arrived in the strawberry field already?</p> <p>This thought lingered in her mind, urging her to go out. She was afraid that she might be wrong, so she didn’t dare to go out immediately, wanting to see if she was right at the same time.</p> <p>Plop!</p> <p>She suddenly heard a stone drop into the water.</p> <p>She opened her eyes to find Wu Yueling squatting by the lakeside, picking up small stones from the ground and mindlessly throwing them into the water. Judging by her expression, she seemed to also want to find out if any other creatures existed in the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao clenched her teeth and decided to go out. She needed to clarify the situation, or she would only be driven to distraction by this question.</p> <p>If she went out and found that she was still in the area where the army was stationed, at worst, she would come back immediately. She estimated that she could come back in less than a second. Could those few people realize what was happening within such a short time and attack her effectively? She greatly doubted that.</p> <p>After making the decision, Lin Qiao took a deep breath and then silently said ‘out’ in her heart. After a light flashed across her eyes, she saw a real strawberry field instead of the vision in her mind!</p> <p>Her eyes widened and a glow flashed across her pure black eyes as she was pleasantly surprised. She circled around and found that she was truly in the strawberry field instead of that urban area.</p> <p>She still remembered her dream, in which, she had run for a very long time to get to the strawberry field. But in reality, the distance between Wu Chengyue, his people, and this strawberry field was only about ten kilometers. She didn’t need to run for a long time, and could arrive here quickly under normal conditions. However, in her dream, she did spend a long time running.</p> <p>How could this be? What had happened?</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t figure this out, feeling that she was out of her depth here!</p> <p>If she were able to move the space by merely dreaming, then, could she simply dream and make it happen whenever she wanted to escape from inside the space in the future? However, what if she didn’t dream? Or, what if she couldn’t have such a dream on demand?</p> <p>And dreaming… She couldn’t control that now, could she?</p> <p>Thinking about this, Lin Qiao wanted to cry a little but failed to shed any tears. She had such a great skill, but didn’t know where the switch was. It was so awful!</p> <p>She glanced around, once again confirming that she wasn’t dreaming. After that, she bent over and picked two full handfuls of strawberries, which were only around six or seven in number, and then re-entered the space.</p> <p>Once she was back inside, she saw the bewildered Wu Yueling looking around, seemingly at a loss. She didn’t know what the child was looking for.</p> <p>The moment Lin Qiao came in, Wu Yueling fixed her eyes on her. Her eyes turned red as she stared at Lin Qiao, her face filled with grievance and dissatisfaction.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was confused. <em>‘What does this child want?’</em></p> <p>As she couldn’t read the little one’s mind at that moment, she had no choice but to reach out her hands, offering the strawberries to Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Seeing the strawberries that Lin Qiao held out for her, Wu Yueling paused briefly first, then immediately covered her nose and turned her face while backing away, frowning with dislike.</p> <p><em>‘They stink!’</em></p> <p>This time, Lin Qiao finally sensed her thought.</p> <p>How could she coax this child to eat the strawberries? Lin Qiao wondered about this while thinking about the options. In any case, she decided to first wash the strawberries to see if the lake water could wash off the bad smell.</p> <p>She turned around and walked to the lakeside, squatting there stiffly. She laid the extra large strawberries by the lakeside before putting them in the water one after another and carefully scrubbing them.</p>",
  "Chapter 30: Come Eat Strawberries": "<p>While watching Lin Qiao’s movements, Wu Yueling came closer with her nose covered, but she still kept herself one or two meters away from them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao washed the strawberries, but then realized that she had nothing to hold them on, so she paused again.</p> <p>As she recalled that the strawberry leaves were quite large, she thought she might as well go out to pick some of them and bring them here to hold these strawberries.</p> <p>With this thought in mind, she gently put the few washed strawberries onto the ground, then once again disappeared from the space. She exited the space, picked a few large and intact leaves, and returned to wash them with the lake water. After that, she washed the strawberries again and wrapped them within these leaves.</p> <p>She sniffed the strawberries, and as she had anticipated, the bad smell was now gone.</p> <p>Lin Qiao carried the strawberries in both hands, then took a few steps toward the edge of the grass. Putting the strawberries on the ground along with the leaves, she stood up straight while looking and waving at Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Wu Yueling’s eyes were filled with confusion when she saw the zombie waving. She tightly pinched her nose and stayed where she was, continuing to spectate instead of going to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>When Wu Yueling refused to come to her, Lin Qiao’s ears suddenly pricked up as she detected a slight noise. She turned her head and saw a small grey fluffy ball shoot out of the grass. It stood by the grass, looking at her and the strawberries by her feet.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked back at it. Surprisingly, she found that the rabbit’s eyes were actually glowing while staring at the strawberries. It seemed that the rabbit wanted to come over but didn’t dare to.</p> <p>The rabbit’s wary posture reminded her of Wu Yueling.</p> <p><em>‘Are these two of a kind?’ </em>Lin Qiao asked herself.</p> <p>Sensing the yearning in the rabbit’s eyes, Lin Qiao tried throwing the smallest strawberry over to it.</p> <p>The rabbit was startled by the strawberry which was suddenly thrown at her. It reflexively turned around and darted back into the grass straightaway.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood still. As she had expected, the rabbit stuck its head out of the grass again a few seconds later. It looked around and found no danger, then leaped out and inched its way to the strawberry. After that, it reached forward with its forepaws, grabbed the strawberry, and then immediately turned around, slipping once more into the grass.</p> <p>Earlier on, it wouldn’t eat the strawberry even when Lin Qiao forced it to. But now, it was literally stealing those strawberries.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched the rabbit carry the strawberry away in confusion, then turned around and waved at Wu Yueling.</p> <p><em>‘Come over here.’</em></p> <p>While looking at Wu Yueling’s sparkling eyes, she spoke to the child in her heart. She didn’t know if she could send out her thoughts, but the eye-contact worked indeed.</p> <p>However, she saw Wu Yueling shaking her head at her in the next moment.</p> <p><em>‘This… Did she hear my thoughts?’ </em>Lin Qiao paused, uncertainty clouding her thoughts.</p> <p>She picked up a strawberry, held it under her nose, and sniffed. Then, she looked at Wu Yueling and waved at her again while saying a few worlds silently.</p> <p><em>‘Come over here. The strawberries have been washed. They no longer stink.’</em></p> <p>After finishing this sentence in her heart, Lin Qiao stared at Wu Yueling and waited for her response. She wasn’t sure if the little one shook her head because she had heard her thoughts or if she was just smart enough to guess her meaning from her movements and expression. Either way, it seemed that they now had a way of communicating with each other.</p> <p>Wu Yueling didn’t say a word, she never had. She wouldn’t even say a word to Wu Chengyue, and had always expressed her thoughts only through movements. Therefore, she might have been able to guess Lin Qiao’s meaning from her movements.</p> <p>As expected, Wu Yueling made some movements of her own after Lin Qiao implied that the strawberries were washed and no longer stank. She slowly loosened her hands which had been pinching her nose, then raised her nose and sniffed toward the strawberries. After confirming that she truly didn’t sense the bad smell, she put down her hands. However, she still didn’t walk over to Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘Really not stinking? Is she lying to me? Those strawberries are poisonous, aren’t they? Will I die if I eat them? But, that rabbit ate some last time and it didn’t die.’ </em>As these thoughts ran through her head, Wu Yueling look at Lin Qiao and struggled.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed her thoughts. Instead of standing there, she slightly turned her body and sat on the ground by the strawberries. Then, she picked up a strawberry and smelled its sweet aroma. No wonder that rabbit ran over so fast. Clearly, its sense of smell was quite sharp as well.</p> <p>However, this sweet aroma held little attraction for Lin Qiao, and didn’t awaken her appetite. Instead, it was the smell of Wu Yueling that had been making her drool this whole time.</p> <p>She glanced at Wu Yueling meaningfully and waved at her again. Seeing that Wu Yueling was finally coming over, she pointed at the strawberry in her hand, then put it into her own mouth and took a bite.</p> <p>The strawberry had a soft and smooth texture, but Lin Qiao still couldn’t taste its flavor.</p> <p>Unlike its skin, the flesh of the strawberries was pink.</p> <p>Lin Qiao finished the strawberry with a few bites, then spread her open hands toward Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Wu Yueling had already started to believe her a little by now. She slowly walked over, and while walking, she sniffed the air for a trace of that bad odor which she had sensed earlier.</p> <p>However, even as she came close to Lin Qiao, she couldn’t smell that awful odor again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked up a beautiful and plump strawberry, then handed it to her. The strawberry still had drops of water on it, making it look tempting in its own way.</p> <p><em>‘Eat, not poisonous.’ </em>Lin Qiao said to Wu Yueling with her eyes.</p> <p>She was worried that Wu Yueling wouldn’t understand her meaning, so she pointed at the strawberry, then waved her hand and swept it across her own neck. After doing that, she closed her eyes, tilted her head, and rolled out her tongue to imitate death for Wu Yueling.</p> <p>However, the kid was only confused by all that.</p> <p>Moments ago, Wu Yueling had already understood her meaning. However, seeing her make such a scary look, the child immediately felt weird and didn’t know how to react.</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened her eyes and looked at Wu Yueling’s blank face. She didn’t sense the latter’s thoughts, but the kid looked at her in a way that one might look at a psychopath, making her fall silent.</p> <p>She was despised by this little kid, wasn’t she?</p> <p>After staring at the weirdly acting Lin Qiao for a few moments, Wu Yueling silently reached out a hand and took the strawberry which Lin Qiao had held out for her, carefully putting it under her nose and sniffing it. She smelled a nice, sweet aroma instead of the bad odor, then squeezed it and found that it was a little soft.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised a finger and then pointed it at her mouth. She meant to encourage Wu Yueling to take a bite and taste the strawberry. However, the latter looked at her with hesitation, doubting for quite a while.</p> <p>She didn’t dare eat it, as she was afraid that it might be poisonous. However, the strawberry now smelled quite delicious. It smelled so good, so sweet! Would it taste quite sweet as well?</p> <p>Seeing her struggling look, Lin Qiao knew what she was thinking without even sensing her thoughts. She then pointed in the direction where the rabbit had disappeared while speaking to her silently with her eyes, <em>‘It’s alright. The rabbit didn’t die.’</em></p> <p>Finally, Wu Yueling could no longer resist the temptation of the strawberry’s aroma and opened her mouth, making a gentle, small bite. She had chosen to believe Lin Qiao.</p> <p>A sweet and slightly sour flavor spread from the tip of her tongue, immediately making her eyes shine. She then took a larger bite, after which, she began eating with an enjoyable face, no longer caring whether the strawberry was poisonous or not.</p> <p>She munched on the strawberry readily. After all, her stomach had been empty as she had been starving for quite long.</p>",
  "Chapter 31: Plant Strawberries in the space": "<p>Seeing that the little girl had finally eaten something, Lin Qiao felt slightly relieved. However, the former couldn’t live on strawberries, so she still needed to find her some other food. As she didn’t plan to send her back for the time being, she had to go and find her some more food.</p> <p>She also needed to find herself some clothes, and beyond that, needed to figure out a way to improve her body condition, as staying this stiff was not a solution. Also, her level seemed to be a bit low and her strength was too poor. She had to grow her strength!</p> <p>In her current condition, if she encountered level-five zombie leaders or superpowered human beings at level-five or above, she would be totally beaten up. She might have time to hide in her space only if she were lucky.</p> <p>The problem was that she didn’t know how to improve her strength. Should she kill zombies and take zombie nuclei like the other zombies did? But earlier on, that level-three zombie’s nucleus hadn’t seemed to benefit her at all, did it?</p> <p>Or, should she kill human beings and collect their energy nuclei?</p> <p>She couldn’t just randomly kill human beings! If the targets were villains…That was a workable thought—this apocalyptic world had provided no shortage of villains!</p> <p>Wasn’t Lu Tianyu a villain? What about the ones who got her killed?</p> <p>If Lin Qiao restored her strength now, she would no longer need to worry about Lin Yong and her other enemies. She could directly pick a fight with them and even have a chance of winning!</p> <p>All in all, if she were going to head South to find her family, she must improve her strength beforehand. After all, she didn’t know what she might run into on her way! In this world, zombies weren’t the only things to fear.</p> <p>Thinking of these things, Lin Qiao turned around and prepared to exit the space. But suddenly, she thought of the little one’s aggrieved and lost expression and realized that the child might feel bored or afraid of staying here alone.</p> <p><em>‘Why not catch that rabbit for her to play with? But then, although the rabbit is small, it looks rather fierce, doesn’t it? Will it bite?’ </em>Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>Lin Qiao focused her ears, carefully listening for noises from the surrounding grasses, then sniffed around with her nose to confirm the little rabbit’s location. After that, she stood up and turned around, slowly walking into the grass.</p> <p>Wu Yueling watched her curiously, wondering what she was going to do. Quite a while later, she saw Lin Qiao come out while carrying that rabbit.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gripped the soft fur behind the rabbit’s neck, which had curled up its legs, dropped its ears, and widened its red eyes. Its two forepaws were still holding the half-eaten strawberry.</p> <p>She walked up to Wu Yueling and handed the rabbit to her. The girl raised her head and looked at her, then glanced at the rabbit. Her expression was blank and a little confused.</p> <p><em>‘Is this for me? I don’t want it! This rabbit is so ugly! I don’t want it!’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling glanced at it a couple of times, then suddenly turned her face which registered a dislike.</p> <p>Sensing her thoughts, Lin Qiao was a little speechless.</p> <p>Didn’t all little girls like fluffy animals? Wasn’t that what people said? Who was the dumba*s who said that? Besides, although this rabbit looked ashy, it was not ugly! Its eyes were very round, its ears were long, and its buck teeth were cute. It was actually quite adorable!</p> <p>Lin Qiao held the rabbit to her own face and looked at it carefully. After confirming that it was indeed quite adorable, she offered the rabbit to Wu Yueling again.</p> <p>Wu Yueling once again turned her head without glancing at the rabbit and continued to silently eat her strawberries.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had no choice but to put the rabbit down. She then poked Wu Yueling’s head with her finger. This child hadn’t washed her hair for many days, so her ponytail was now loose and greasy.</p> <p>Wu Yueling raised her head to look at Lin Qiao as the latter poked her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao first pointed at the sky with her finger, then pointed at herself. After that, she suddenly vanished.</p> <p>With these gestures, she was trying to warn Wu Yueling that she would be leaving.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao disappear suddenly, Wu Yueling paused for a second, then her eyes turned red and her lips quivered. She looked around in panic but didn’t see Lin Qiao. Maybe because she had experienced this a few times and had gotten used to this already, she calmed back down after glancing around again and confirming that Lin Qiao had truly left this place.</p> <p>She quietly continued to eat her strawberry, finally finishing a whole one. After that, she lowered her head and looked at the rest of the strawberries beside her, then soon picked another one and continued eating.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Qiao gazed around at the strawberry field after exiting the space. The moonlight poured onto the ground, casting a faint silvery glow. As the strawberries couldn’t be stored in her space for too long after being picked, she wondered if she could plant some strawberry plants in her space and make them grow.</p> <p>She made a move once she had this idea, immediately bending over in the strawberry field and digging up the roots of a strawberry plant. She didn’t know how to transplant, so she simply dug out the entire strawberry plant along with the soil, then directly threw it into her space.</p> <p>Fortunately, her claws were useful and allowed her to dig into the ground easily. However, her movements were slow due to her poor flexibility. Finally an hour later, a large area of this strawberry field was emptied by a zombie named Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After digging up tens of strawberry plants, Lin Qiao stopped and then flashed into her space.</p> <p>Once she was in the space, she found that the strawberry plants had been thrown into the middle of the grass, crushing the grasses to the ground. At the moment, Wu Yueling stood quite far away while holding the last two washed strawberries.</p> <p>Many strawberries were still hanging on the strawberry plants that Lin Qiao had thrown in, so the entire place stank due to the unwashed fruit.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wasn’t bothered by the stench, so she slowly separated these strawberry plants and then began digging holes in her space. After digging, she directly planted these strawberries in.</p> <p>This series of movements took her a long while. After she finished planting the strawberries, she stood up and glanced at Wu Yueling, only to find that the kid had moved to the other side of the lake and was curled up asleep on the grasses.</p> <p>Lin Qiao suddenly slapped her own forehead. She should have brought something to sleep on first, but she hadn’t thought about that.</p> <p>The little one looked so pitiful while sleeping on the grasses like this!</p> <p>She went to the lakeside and washed her hands. After carefully washing the soil off her hands, she looked back at the planted strawberries. The strawberries plants were wilting, and she would need to water them later on.</p> <p>She again flashed out of the space, then glanced around her and spotted a house-like building in the near distance. It should be where the owner of this strawberry field had lived before the apocalyptic era started.</p> <p>She walked toward the house and soon arrived there, albeit with a bit of an effort.</p> <p>It was a flat-roofed house. The door and windows were shabby, and the things inside the house had been ransacked and carelessly thrown about. This house had clearly been looted, but that must have had happened a very long time ago, because everything was covered by a thick layer of dust now.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked inside and took a look around. Not much was left in there, as everything of use had already been taken away.</p> <p>She wandered around, searching through the living room and bedroom, but failed to find even a rotten quilt. She found a dusty mat which hadn’t broken even after such a long time because it was made from bamboo.</p>",
  "Chapter 32: The Change of the Claws": "<p>Lin Qiao picked up the mat, then walked out of the house and hung it on a handrail outside. After doing this, she broke off a sturdy twig with leaves on it and whacked the bamboo mat hard, sending dust flying into the air.</p> <p>She instinctively covered her nose before stretching out her hand which was holding the twig and continuing to whack and sweep, even though the dust couldn’t cause any irritation obviously.</p> <p>She stopped until she saw no more dust rising, then turned around and walked back into the room.</p> <p>This was the only house nearby, so she had no other place to go and search for the things she needed immediately. Besides the mat, she also found a few old clothes there. Some of them were already worn down, but fortunately, a few items were still wearable. Although those were all menswear, she didn’t care as she just needed something to cover herself right now, and fashion appropriateness was the last of her worries.</p> <p>She shook those clothes, stirring up another wave of dust…</p> <p>At last, Lin Qiao found some pots, pans, and bowls, which she threw into her space along with the other useful articles that she found. The bed, table, chairs, stools, couch, and some other things were also thrown into her space.</p> <p>After looking around and seeing that she had nearly emptied the house, Lin Qiao turned around and entered her space.</p> <p>Before this, nothing but grasses had existed in her space. She wouldn’t have cared about this if she were alone. She was able to fall asleep by lying randomly on the ground anyway, although zombies didn’t seem to need sleep.</p> <p>But now, she was responsible for a child, and surely couldn’t let her sleep on the ground! The child had a blanket before, but she had torn it apart.</p> <p>Fortunately, some people had lived near this strawberry field before, and a few of their belongings were still useable.</p> <p>Lin Qiao threw everything she could find into her space and piled them up on a spot far away from her own strawberry field. After returning to her space, she started to get busy with dusting and cleaning those things.</p> <p>She picked up a piece of rag and wetted it with the lake water, then wiped the bed, tables, chairs, and all the other articles with it. After being done with that, she washed the pots, pans, and bowls. Having washed everything, she dragged the plank bed to a flat area, nipped off a huge bunch of grasses with her fingernails, and laid them on it, followed by putting the bamboo mat on top of the grasses.</p> <p>Finishing all of this, she went around to the other side of the lake and gently lifted Wu Yueling, who was still asleep, then walked back and put her onto the bed.</p> <p>Once lain on the bed, Wu Yueling didn’t wake up but unconsciously curled up her body.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked up a large cloth, shook off the dust, and then covered her with it. She then turned around and took the other few clothes over to the lake in order to wash them. After washing them, she directly spread them onto the grasses to dry.</p> <p>Once she had finally finished up with all the cleaning, she then began watering the strawberry plants with a bucket.</p> <p>She had been so busy that she didn’t notice her movements becoming much more flexible, and her body much less stiff than before.</p> <p>After watering the strawberry plants, she sat on the broken couch to rest.</p> <p>She truly didn’t feel tired. On the contrary, the longer she worked, the more energetic she seemed to feel. She only sat down because there was nothing more for her to do.</p> <p>Sitting on the sofa with her legs crossed, she closed her eyes to get a sense of the situation outside. After finding nothing unusual, she directly exited her space from the couch.</p> <p>…</p> <p>It was already very bright outside, which meant that she had spent the whole night cleaning the furniture and other things.</p> <p>She didn’t know if those strawberry plants that she dug up and planted in her space would survive. She was actually not that confident about it.</p> <p>After leaving her space, Lin Qiao bypassed the area that Wu Chengyue was stationed in. She planned to go into the city first to look for bookstores or supermarkets where she could try and find a map to read.</p> <p>She casually put on a loose fitting shirt. It was unwashed, but as a zombie, she actually didn’t mind this too much.</p> <p>After getting out of her space, Lin Qiao noticed that her body seemed to be much more relaxed and flexible than before. She was now free to make any movement she wanted. It appeared that the effects of the lightning strike had faded by now.</p> <p>Clenching her fists, she caught a faint weird feeling for some reason. It was as though her strength had improved quite a lot after being struck by the lightning. Was it true?</p> <p>With this thought, she immediately stopped moving and glanced at a tree by the roadside, then walked over to it with some hesitation.</p> <p>Standing under the tree, she popped out her claws. Her pure dark claws were sharp, shining with a metallic luster. She glanced at an arm-thick, three-meters-tall branch on the tree, then suddenly leaped up and slashed at it fiercely.</p> <p>A cracking sound was heard when the branch fell on the ground, followed by a series of rustling noises caused by the shaking leaves.</p> <p>Lin Qiao observed the branch that she had cut off, and found the cut to be neat and smooth. It looked like it had been cut by a very sharp blade instead of her fingernails, and that too very quickly.</p> <p>However, as she observed her claws, she found that they couldn’t be considered very long, only around ten centimeters in length. However, the cut edge of the branch had a diameter of about four decimeters. How could her claws create such a smooth cut?</p> <p>Her claws weren’t even long enough to do this! Besides, when she cut the branch with these claws, she didn’t feel them coming in contact with anything, even though the branch had indeed been cleanly cut off.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at her claws for quite a while, but couldn’t figure out how this could have happened.</p> <p>She stood up, placed a foot on the tree, then reached out her claws to swing at the branches behind the tree.</p> <p>This time, she did feel something.</p> <p>It seemed that a few beams of light flashed inside her claws, and before they even touched the branches, the latter were slide by some kind of air blade.</p> <p><em>‘So handy!’ </em>Lin Qiao looked at her claws as her eyes suddenly glowed with excitement.</p> <p>She looked at the tree trunk, which was about as thick as a slim woman’s waist. After thinking briefly, she raised her hand to swing her claws at it hard.</p> <p>Snap!</p> <p>Hearing a clear snapping sound, Lin Qiao looked at the four deep scratches on the tree trunk, causing her eyes to shine even brighter. She moved closer and observed the depth of these scratches, finding that among the four scratches, the one created by her forefinger was the deepest. Two-thirds of the tree trunk had been cut by it.</p> <p>She then raised her hand and pressed it against the upper tree trunk to push it hard. She had a great strength, and with her touch, the entire tree slowly fell backward along with a prolonged cracking noise.</p> <p>She withdrew her hand, then turned around in satisfaction and walked toward the city. It seemed that the power of her claws had been upgraded again.</p> <p>However, before she had gotten far, she suddenly sensed a few different vibes around her. Those vibes belonged to a couple of human beings and a very strong zombie! Based on the vibes that she had sensed so keenly, she estimated the zombie to be at the peak of level-four or above!</p> <p>Moreover, she was somewhat familiar with the vibes of the few human beings. Weren’t they the few superpowered men who had tried to block her way yesterday?</p>",
  "Chapter 33: The Betrayal of Teammates": "<p>A stream of fire rose into the sky. The fire wasn’t so eye-catching during the day, but it went quite high nevertheless. On the ground, scorch marks could be seen all over the place.</p> <p>Xie Dong and the other four stood in a group, trying their best to defend against the zombies in front of them with their superpowers. At that moment, the five of them looked miserable, their eyes revealing their despair.</p> <p>This team with one level-four, one-level three, and three level-two superpowered human beings was already a remarkable team. Outside the bases, this team would even have a chance against a level-four superpowered zombie.</p> <p>However, they weren’t facing a level-four zombie right now, but a level-five one!</p> <p>The five of them had already been surrounded by a great number of ordinary zombies. Under the control of the level-five zombie, they pounced on this group of people like crazy.</p> <p>They opened their mouths wide, their eyes filled with a greedy appetite for food. Stretching out their arms, they curled their hands into claws and attempted to approach and rip those human beings apart.</p> <p>Xie Dong and the other four stood back to back in a circle, releasing their powers to attack the zombies which had jumped on them.</p> <p>Being supported by Huang Xiao’s wind power, Xie Dong built a round fire wall, keeping his teammates and himself inside. The zombies which dared to come near them would be set ablaze by the fire immediately.</p> <p>In front of the zombie group was a scrawny figure, its eyes sparkling with a wild sharpness and a frosty lust for killing.</p> <p>It looked like a man in his forties or fifties, but its body had changed too much already. One could roughly tell its age before death, but could no longer see how he would have had looked originally.</p> <p>At this moment, its pitch black eyes were sparkling with a distinct red light. The light was vertical and looked like the pupils of a wild beast. This creature bent its spine and stood there with its legs straightened, its deformed hands dropping by its sides. Those hands had become huge, with fingers which were twice as long as those of normal human beings. Its sharp fingernails were three whole decimeters long, and looked incredibly hard.</p> <p>Other than its dark eyes with their red glow, this zombie had a mouth that had cracked open from ear to ear. As this mouth wasn’t open at the moment, it showed up only as a rough crack which was stained with fresh blood.</p> <p>It calmly looked at the five human beings inside the encirclement of the ordinary zombies. Its eyes didn’t contain the desperate appetite for food that the other zombies had been showing.</p> <p>This was a level-five zombie leader. A zombie of this level could not only control hundreds of ordinary zombies and make them follow its directions, but also control a small number of intelligent zombies.</p> <p>An example of that was the two by its side right now.</p> <p>The level-five zombie had a very strong vibe, for which reason, the intelligent zombies beside it dared not to go against its will. Otherwise, they would end up being torn into pieces, and their zombie nuclei would be devoured.</p> <p>At this moment, Xie Dong and the other few had seen the calm zombie in front of them and recognized that it was a level-five zombie leader. With despair in their eyes, they were still unwilling to give up and kept on fighting. While crazily attacking the ordinary zombies around the fire wall, they had been trying to think of a way to escape.</p> <p>However, they all understood that there was no escape from this level-five zombie.</p> <p>There were over ten people in this team, but by this time, only the five strongest had survived. The rest of the team had already been torn into pieces and eaten by the group of zombies.</p> <p>At this point, Xie Dong regretted leaving with his teammates the day before instead of strictly leading them to follow the army. Now, his presentiment had actually come true. That dangerous feeling of being targeted turned out to have originated from this level-five zombie.</p> <p>None of the five said anything, because any words would be useless right now.</p> <p>At this moment, a dark expression flashed across Huang Xiao’s eyes. He glanced at Xie Dong, who was by his side, then winked at the other few people. The other three people immediately showed their understanding in the eyes.</p> <p>By this time, Xie Dong was barely hanging on. He had used too much of his superpower, and his energy nucleus was already showing signs of exhaustion right now. However, he dared not to stop, because once he did, the other people wouldn’t even last for thirty seconds before they were torn apart by the zombies that had pounced on them.</p> <p>Besides, the zombie leader hadn’t even made a move, and neither did the intelligent zombies by its side. They had all been standing over there quietly, watching and waiting for Xie Dong and his teammates to die of exhaustion.</p> <p>“I can’t hold on any longer! My energy is running out. We need to think of a way to survive!” Even though the expression on Xie Dong’s chiseled face could still be considered calm, his face was a little pale. The sweat oozed out of his forehead and dripped down his face drop by drop.</p> <p>At this moment, Huang Xiao’s eyes suddenly shone. He gave a slight nod at the other three, then turned his head and said to Xie Dong, “I have an idea that might buy us some time, but…”</p> <p>Hearing him, Xie Dong was delighted. He was truly convinced that Huang Xiao had a good idea.</p> <p>“What idea?” He asked hurriedly.</p> <p>A faint sneer flashed across Huang Xiao’s face as he laughed, “The idea is… using you as a shield!”</p> <p>While speaking, he suddenly restrained his power, then turned around and kicked out, directly smashing the unprepared Xie Dong away. Next, the four of them suddenly clasped hands and disappeared from where they were.</p> <p>Seeing Xie Dong being kicked out with no defense, all the surrounding zombies paused briefly, then pounced on him violently. On the other side, Huang Xiao and the others took the opportunity to enter the space which belonged to one of them within a blink of an eye.</p> <p>Xie Dong’s face turned extremely dark when he was kicked away. He had never expected to be betrayed by his teammates. But fortunately, he had a top-grade capacity for reaction. After all, he had spent his time in the special forces.</p> <p>The moment he was kicked out, he hurriedly flipped through the air and the fire on his hands shrank, swiftly wrapping him within a fireball.</p> <p>The zombies that were pouncing on him got in contact with his fire and started to burn.</p> <p>“Huang-Xiao!” Xie Dong called out Huang Xiao’s name through clenched teeth, his voice containing a strong hatred and disbelief.</p> <p>He knew that Huang Xiao had never liked him, but he didn’t think that he would actually go so far as to betray him. Huang Xiao actually wanted him to be eaten by these zombies.</p> <p>Besides, someone with space power actually existed among them, having a space that had air, so people could stay inside without being suffocated. Xie Dong knew nothing about this! Those few people had always been on Huang Xiao’s side, and had ganged up with him. They kept the space power a secret from Xie Dong, and actually joined hands to kick him out.</p> <p>Earlier on, he had tried so hard to protect those people, but every single one of them turned out to be ungrateful, brutal, and cold-blooded!</p> <p>Xie Dong figured that Huang Xiao and the others must have been waiting for him to use up his energy before making their move. After all, only in this way would he die for sure!</p> <p>It turned out that they had been plotting against him the whole time. No wonder when he fought together with Huang Xiao earlier on, he felt that the latter hadn’t put in his greatest efforts. Back then, he thought that Huang Xiao’s superpower was running out as well, but as he reconsidered things now, he found how wrong he had been.</p>",
  "Chapter 34: Level-five zombies": "<p>Lin Qiao had arrived onto a tree which was at some distance from the battleground. She directly flashed into her space, then closed her eyes to sense the situation outside. She knew that the level-five zombie had sensed her existence, so she entered her space as soon as she arrived there.</p> <p>The level-five zombie leader merely glanced in her direction and then paid no more attention to her, instead keeping its eyes fixed on Xie Dong.</p> <p>It wanted this human being’s energy nuclei, as well as his delicious blood and flesh. It had had its eyes on this group of human beings for a couple of days before finally making a move and forcing them into this area.</p> <p>It was going to make its move the day before, but a great human army had suddenly shown up back then. Some superpowered human beings in the army were stronger than itself, so it didn’t dare to move, choosing instead to wait until now.</p> <p>Fortunately, the two powerful human beings didn’t discover it.</p> <p>At the moment, Xie Dong was trying to figure out a way to break out of this zombie encirclement He didn’t know what to do right now. Even if he managed to break out of the zombie crowd, there would be two intelligent zombies to deal with. To make matters worse, even if he killed the two intelligent zombies, there would still be the zombie leader to face.</p> <p>What could he do to escape these zombies’ lethal attacks?</p> <p>He only had fire power, but couldn’t fly or move underground. Yet, even if his power had been used up, he still had his combat skills. Hence, he might still be able to defend himself against the two intelligent zombies by punching and kicking. However, against the zombie leader which had a superpower of its own and was capable of controlling other zombies, he was totally powerless.</p> <p>At this very moment, the zombie leader seemed to have finally gotten tired of waiting as it growled at the two intelligent zombies by its sides.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Hearing it, the two intelligent zombies immediately darted out and rushed straight at Xie Dong.</p> <p>They were extremely fast and nimble as they rushed into the crowd of zombies, leaping directly over their heads, and using the heads as stepping stones to rush over to Xie Dong, who was inside the encirclement.</p> <p>Seeing these two finally make a move, Xie Dong was shocked.</p> <p>The zombie leader didn’t seem to want to keep waiting.</p> <p>The two intelligent zombies seemed not to fear Xie Dong’s fire as they fiercely charged at him, who hurriedly threw out two fireballs at them in order to defend.</p> <p>However, they dodged the fireballs by moving nimbly to the side. At the same time, they rushed up to Xie Dong, brandishing their sharp claws and clawing at his body which was wrapped in a thin layer of flame.</p> <p>The flames wrapped around Xie Dong’s body were greatly weakened by now because of using some of the little energy left in him to create the fireballs. So, if he were clawed by these two intelligent zombies now, his flames would be crushed and extinguished easily.</p> <p>However, the zombie leader felt that it was not enough. It suddenly reached out its hand, spreading its fingers to make a claw which was waved at Xie Dong. A wave of coldness surged all around the place, and then hailstones fell from the sky one after another, striking the latter’s body.</p> <p>These hailstones were melted by Xie Dong’s fire when they landed on him, but at the same time, they had weakened it as well. The surrounding temperature dropped and actually pressed down the fire on Xie Dong’s body.</p> <p>“Pah!” Xie Dong felt a pressure on his chest, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood. However, before he could react, the two intelligent zombies were already clawing at him again.</p> <p>He hurriedly rolled on the ground, then violently shoved at the surrounding zombies regardless of being scratched by them. With that, he managed to create a gap in the zombie crowd and rushed out through it.</p> <p>There was a building nearby, and it happened to be a supermarket. The supermarket would have a warehouse, which could serve as his temporary shelter.</p> <p>He would rather die than become a meal for zombies, and he refused to allow the level-five zombie to dig out his energy nucleus and absorb it to turn his power into its.</p> <p>While running, Xie Dong made sure to track the level-five zombie leader’s actions.</p> <p>After pouncing and missing their target, the two intelligent zombies immediately turned around and chased after him at a high speed.</p> <p>When these two arrived behind him, Xie Dong suddenly threw out two fireballs and hit them squarely. After that, he took out the rifle which had been carried on his back the whole time and fired two shots at the two.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>He aimed the rifle and shot at the surrounding zombies swiftly, accurately, and fiercely with non-stop bullets. His shots were extremely precise, with every bullet blowing off a zombie’s head.</p> <p>The two intelligent zombies paused briefly when they were hit by the fireballs. By the time they realized what was happening, Xie Dong’s bullets had taken off their heads.</p> <p>Anyhow, he had once been an elite special force soldier. If he didn’t fear that level-five zombie, he wouldn’t have saved the rifle till the end. But now, his power had run out, and the rifle was his last resort.</p> <p>The level-five zombie saw Xie Dong break out of the zombie crowd and kill its two underlings, so it finally moved again.</p> <p>Seeing it move, Xie Dong immediately fired two shots at it, then quickly ran into the building and rushed toward the warehouse.</p> <p>The moving speed of a level-five zombie couldn’t be measured by the human eye. Therefore, the two shots that Xie Dong fired at this zombie leader couldn’t possibly hit it. It turned into an animal-like shadow and flashed across the air, rushing toward the building in front of Xie Dong.</p> <p>It patiently watched Xie Dong run into the building. The latter’s speed was very slow in its eyes, so it was in no rush to pounce on him and bite him to death. Instead, it suddenly darted before him, blocking his way like a cat teasing a rat.</p> <p>Seeing that his way was blocked, Xie Dong remained calm and immediately raised the gun to shoot at the zombie leader. However, it dodged the shots again, crawling and darting all over the wall like a spider. It clearly wasn’t afraid of the bullets at all.</p> <p>During the fight, neither of them noticed a transparent figure which had suddenly appeared nearby. That figure dashed toward Xie Dong and grasped his arm, followed by the latter vanishing from his spot.</p> <p>The zombie leader paused, its facial expression freezing briefly. It blinked a few times in confusion as it finally realized what had happened, opening its mouth wide and bursting into a raging growl.</p> <p>“Roarrrr!”</p> <p>It thrust toward where Xie Dong had disappeared and circled around in agitation, but failed to sense his vibe. All that it sensed was the smell that he had left behind.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>The zombie leader couldn’t have imagined that the meat which was about to fall into its mouth would disappear just like that. It angrily jumped up and down, bumping its head against the wall and leaving holes in it.</p> <p>His power rose along with his anger, making the temperature drop sharply. As a result, the ground was quickly crusted with a layer of ice.</p> <p>If this zombie were a human being, it would certainly have cursed like, ‘Damn it! Where’s my meat? Damn it! Who stole my meat?’</p> <p>However, it couldn’t talk or think like a human being. It’s instinctive ferocity and acquired intelligence didn’t allow it to figure out what had just happened.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>After a few frenzied moments, the zombie leader finally calmed down. However, it didn’t stop uttering deep growls from its throat, its voice sounding very angry and confused.</p> <p>It just couldn’t understand how that human being had disappeared into thin air. It had observed him for a long time, and was assured that he didn’t have the space power. If he did, why hadn’t he used it earlier? Why did he wait until now?</p> <p>Despite all of this, he had clearly and certainly disappeared!</p>",
  "Chapter 35: Successful rescue": "<p>While Xie Dong was holding the gun and firing at the level-five zombie which had been crawling all over the wall, his eyes were suddenly dazzled, and then the scene before him changed completely.</p> <p>The wall and the insides of the dilapidated building were gone! The level-five zombie was gone! Where did these green grasses and this lake come from?</p> <p>Before he figured out what exactly he was looking at, he suddenly turned and pointed his gun at a figure standing not far away from him.</p> <p><em>‘A zombie?’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong paused for a second before automatically firing a shot at the zombie.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Facing the bullet that flew at her, Lin Qiao moved slightly and clenched her hand, grasping the bullet in her hand. In her eyes, the movement of the bullet had been too slow. Therefore, she caught it easily without even needing to look at it.</p> <p>Xie Dong was shocked into silence.</p> <p>This zombie had actually caught his bullet. He now knew that this zombie was very powerful, but he couldn’t tell which level it had reached.</p> <p>His heart sank when he saw Lin Qiao catch the bullet so easily. Looking around at this strange environment, he had guessed that this was a separate space.</p> <p><em>‘A space zombie!’</em></p> <p>Before he could confirm the facts, he saw the zombie in front of him throw the bullet at him, its face filled with dislike!</p> <p>The bullet landed gently on his head.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? What do the disgust and the scorn in the zombie’s eyes mean? Since when can a zombie have such a human expression?’</em></p> <p>Because of Lin Qiao’s reaction, Xie Dong looked at her with nothing but a look of confusion on his face. However, he never relaxed his vigilance still. Tightening his body, he gripped the gun as he stared at Lin Qiao without moving.</p> <p>Then, he watched this zombie make a gesture, one that left him dumbfounded again.</p> <p>The zombie’s gesture told him, <em>‘Stop! The situation has changed.’</em></p> <p>It wasn’t important that he could understand what the zombie meant. What was important was that this zombie’s gesture was a hand signal from the special forces training camps.</p> <p>Even some ordinary soldiers wouldn’t know about this hand signal, so how could a zombie know? Was this zombie a special forces soldier before death? Did she still retain her lifetime memories after she died and became a zombie?</p> <p>However, that was impossible! The virus infection would hit the brain first. Basically, zombies’ brain neurons were eroded by the virus, which was the reason why they became ‘zombies’. Zombies were not conscious beings, and they only had the instinct of eating human beings. Even if they upgraded, their old memories wouldn’t be regained.</p> <p>When Xie Dong was measuring Lin Qiao with his eyes, a pebble flew over from the side and hit his body.</p> <p>Next, a small figure suddenly ran over and stopped before Lin Qiao, spreading her arms to shield her. Her little face was filled with vigilance as she stared at Xie Dong.</p> <p><em>‘Are my eyes going bonkers or what? How can I see Chief Wu’s precious daughter in this place?’ </em>Xie Dong thought.</p> <p>Wu Yueling panicked when she saw a strange man show up and point a gun at the zombie.</p> <p>She knew that that thing was called a gun, which could blow off a zombie’s head. She couldn’t let this zombie’s head be blown off!</p> <p>“Aren’t you… You are… Come over here! Eh…” Xie Dong’s widened his eyes as he looked at Wu Yueling and said to her, his face filled with confusion.</p> <p>He was anxious to call Wu Yueling over, because he now realized that the creature standing behind this child was a man-eating zombie!</p> <p>However, before he could finish, a light-headed feeling nearly made him kneel.</p> <p>He glanced at his scratched wounds which were inflicted by other zombies earlier and realized that the virus inside his body had begun attacking.</p> <p>He had been concentrating intensely on himself the whole time, but just now, he was too distracted by the appearance of the little girl. Once he slightly unstrung his spirit, his body started responding to the virus infection.</p> <p>While pointing the gun at Lin Qiao with difficulty, he said to Wu Yueling, “You… You come here now… That’s a zombie… It’s gonna eat you…”</p> <p>He had no time now to think about why this zombie would know the signals of special forces soldiers. He just wanted the child to stay away from that dangerous zombie.</p> <p>He didn’t know why this child was in this zombie’s space without the latter having eaten her. There were too many questions that Xie Dong didn’t have the time to think about.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, after hearing what he said, Wu Yueling shook her head and remained standing motionlessly before the zombie.</p> <p>Noticing the change in Xie Dong’s expression, Lin Qiao’s eyes sparkled. She knew that it was the virus inside his body attacking.</p> <p>Earlier on, when she saw Xie Dong rush out of the zombie crowd, she knew that it was already too late to save him. However, she had no other way. She couldn’t just go out there and fight the level-five zombie leader, as she felt that she had no chance of winning.</p> <p>At that time, she was also feeling anxious, wondering how she could make herself invisible and get Xie Dong inside her space without attracting the zombie leader’s attention.</p> <p>In the next moment, she suddenly entered a very strange state. She felt dizzy as though she was falling asleep, but then saw some blurred images that felt like a dream, but also like an imagination.</p> <p>After that, when she finally was clear-headed again, she saw a bullet flying toward her. Fortunately, her eyesight was different from that of ordinary human beings. She clearly saw the track of the bullet, feeling that it wasn’t moving fast enough.</p> <p>Before she realized what was happening, her hand reacted before her brain could and caught the bullet.</p> <p>He had actually shot at her! At that moment, Lin Qiao was a bit angry. She then disdainfully threw the bullet back and showed him a hand signal that only special forces soldiers knew.</p> <p>Based on the battles that Xie Dong had fought earlier, she figured at first glance that he was a special forces soldier.</p> <p>Therefore, she used a hand signal to make him stop. However, she couldn’t have known that right at that moment, the little one would run out and shield her, seemingly trying to protect her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was slightly surprised. She truly hadn’t expected that the little thing would worry about her. The child was tiny in size, but her courage was not! Did she recklessly run out to shield her like that simply because she didn’t want her to die? Wasn’t she afraid of death herself?</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt slightly gratified. At least, this child had thought to protect her now! This child actually thought to protect her! What kind of a normal child would think of protecting a zombie?</p> <p>She gently reached out a hand and pressed it on Wu Yueling’s tiny arm, then walked out from behind her and slightly turned her body in order to shield the latter.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could clearly tell that Xie Dong was turning into a zombie.</p> <p>“Hmm… Eh? Ahhhhhh!” Xie Dong’s brain was attacked by a horribly severe pain, which immediately made him stop worrying about Wu Yueling’s safety as he could barely be concerned about himself now.</p> <p>The intense pain in his head made him stoop. The rifle fell from his hands to the ground. To a former soldier, the gun was his life. However, the gun now lay forgotten on the ground as Xie Dong was already in too much pain to stay conscious at this moment.</p> <p>He held his head tightly with both hands, pressing hard while bending downward. He then fell onto the ground, his whole body twitching and curling up.</p>",
  "Chapter 36: Attack of the Virus": "<p>Seeing the state that Xie Dong was in, Wu Yueling started feeling confused. She blankly watched him curl up and twitch on the ground, then raised her head to look at Lin Qiao in confusion. Her eyes were filled with a thirst for knowledge and understanding.</p> <p>Lin Qiao first pointed at Xie Dong, then at herself. After that, she flicked her fingernails in the air and made a gesture exclusive to zombies.</p> <p>Wu Yueling immediately understood Lin Qiao’s meaning. She stepped back a little and hid behind the latter, showing only half of her head and a pair of eyes.</p> <p><em>‘Is that man turning into a zombie? Will he become a man-eating one as well?’ </em>With this thought, Wu Yueling was suddenly afraid.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was both amused and speechless as she looked at Wu Yueling’s rabbit eyes.</p> <p>This child’s mind was so hard to understand! A moment ago, she had acted fearlessly by standing before Lin Qiao, but now, she hid behind her with fear.</p> <p>“Ah!!Ah!!” At this moment, Xie Dong’s face began to twist. He couldn’t stop screaming hoarsely, and his voice sounded severely pained and miserable. By this time, no one could stop his transformation.</p> <p>“Ah! K-kill… Kill… Kill… Me… Ah… Ah… Ah!” Somehow, he managed to recover some consciousness and shout a few words while screaming painfully. Those were no more than three words, yet he was unable to squeeze them out of his mouth coherently. However, he eventually finished saying them.</p> <p>He didn’t know if this zombie in front of him could understand him, neither did he know if Wu Yueling had heard him. At this very moment, he just desired a quick death and for the pain to stop.</p> <p>After he screamed out that short sentence, his expression became even more twisted. His body wasn’t curled up and twitching anymore, but suddenly popped straight. After that, his limbs twisted and he began struggling and rolling around on the ground. As he crazily tossed and turned on the ground, his body distorted weirdly into some impossible shapes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took a few steps backward and pushed Wu Yueling along with her. All the while, her eyes were fixed on this man who was turning into a zombie.</p> <p>By this time, Xie Dong’s face was filled with protruding veins and his mouth was opened wide. His white teeth were exposed in the air, looking very scary. However, even at this moment, one last bit of emotion still remained in his eyes.</p> <p>He was begging…</p> <p>He looked at Lin Qiao beseechingly. By now, he had felt that this zombie wouldn’t harm people. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have saved him from that level-five zombie leader, and Wu Yueling wouldn’t be standing perfectly unharmed next to her.</p> <p>The last thought he had right now was a wish for this zombie to kill him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Xie Dong’s wide open eyes which were almost bulging out of his eye sockets. Those eyes had been rolling up bit by bit, and the pupils had been turning gray.</p> <p>She suddenly popped out her sharp claws and darted out from before Wu Yueling. In a moment, she rushed up to Xie Dong who was already distorted into a weird shape, preparing to insert her claws into his skull.</p> <p>But right at this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p> <p>Xie Dong’s eyes suddenly flashed and then turned entirely gray while he was writhing on the ground. In the next moment, he swiftly bounced and tilted his head, miraculously dodging Lin Qiao’s claws. Then, he propped up his body on all fours like a spider and crawled toward the lake at an incredible speed. He quickly arrived at the lake, thrust himself against the ground, and jumped to the lakeside.</p> <p>Plop! He actually jumped into the lake!</p> <p>Lin Qiao was dumbfounded, rooted to the spot with her claw continuing to stretch out. She was utterly shocked as she watched the zombie Xie Dong dodge her attack within a blink of an eye and jump into the lake.</p> <p>Once she realized what had happened, she rushed to the lakeside and stared at the widening circles of ripples on the water surface. However, zombie Xie Dong had disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>To be honest, Lin Qiao hadn’t gone down to the middle of the lake. She had been bathing and washing things by the lakeside all this time, but hadn’t had the time to go down and take a look. She didn’t know how deep the water was or what was in there.</p> <p>But just now, this newborn zombie had made that journey even before her.</p> <p>Furthermore, this zombie Xie Dong was weird, obviously not an ordinary zombie. Judging by the looks of it, it had directly entered level-one or two, which was the only explanation for his swift reactions and movements.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood by the lake, her brows knitted.</p> <p>The situation was troublesome now. She had let a low-level zombie hide in her space. Things would have been fine if no one was in her space, but there was a child to think of! However, Lin Qiao now dared not to go down the lake to find the zombie, as she was afraid that it would crawl back up from the other side once she went down. If that happened, they would be in for some serious trouble.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that this space was not yet fully under her control. If only she could sense the situation deep down in the lake… As of now, she could only sense the space above the lake surface, but nothing below the water.</p> <p>For now, all she could do was stay in the space and wait for zombie Xie Dong to come out of the water. She couldn’t send Wu Yueling out of the space, as the outside world wasn’t any safer while there were zombies all over the place.</p> <p>She went back to Wu Yueling’s side and pointed at the area where the furniture was placed, signaling for her to go and stay there.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was also staring at the water curiously, wondering what had happened underwater to the man who had turned into a zombie. Would he drown? Was he able to swim in the water like a fish?</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao’s hand signal, she understood that she couldn’t linger here. She didn’t dare to stay here anyway.</p> <p>Therefore, when Lin Qiao raised a hand and pointed at the area with the bed and couch, she immediately turned around and walked toward it. While walking, she turned back to confirm whether Lin Qiao was following her.</p> <p>Obviously, Lin Qiao followed behind Wu Yueling. As she walked, she turned around to glance at the lake surface which was gradually becoming calm.</p> <p>She thought that the zombie Xie Dong would stay underwater for a long time. However, after she had walked only a few steps behind Wu Yueling, her ears moved suddenly and she stopped, turning her head and staring at the surface of the lake without blinking</p> <p>As she had suspected, the gradually calming water surface now rippled slightly again, as though something was coming out of it. In fact, something did come out of the water, and it was the zombie Xie Dong who had leaped into the lake not too long ago.</p> <p>After a series of ripples, a figure quietly surfaced, floating motionlessly on the water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was shocked.</p> <p><em>‘What happened?’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling sensed that Lin Qiao had stopped walking behind her, so she stopped as well. Her senses were rather keen, so once the latter had stopped following her, she had felt it almost immediately.</p> <p>She turned around as well and looked at Lin Qiao. Seeing her staring straight at the lake surface, Wu Yueling walked over curiously and stood behind her legs, sticking her head out to look as well. She then saw the motionless figure which was floating on the water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao frowned, not knowing what was going on. Why had Xie Dong become like this after he turned into a zombie and jumped into the water? She remembered that when she went down into the water for the first time, it seemed that she had slept for a long time before she woke up.</p> <p>She didn’t know if Xie Dong was going through the same situation as she had.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a moment thinking about this. Since Xie Dong had floated up to the surface, she surely needed to go over and take a look. He was unable to move, and therefore, posed no threat. In that case, she could directly touch him and send him out of the space.</p>",
  "Chapter 37: The Zombie Which Jumped into the Water": "<p>With this thought, Lin Qiao immediately turned around, squatting down and looking straight at Wu Yueling. She pointed at her and then at the area with the furniture, signaling her to go there alone. After that, she pointed at herself and then at Xie Dong, who had turned into a zombie and was now floating on the lake surface.</p> <p>After that, she pointed at the sky.</p> <p>She made a series of gestures as she tried to tell Wu Yueling to go and stay in that area by herself and not go anywhere else, while informing that she herself would deal with the thing on the water and send it outside the space.</p> <p>Wu Yueling silently looked at her for a moment without letting her know if she had understood her meaning or not. The child didn’t go to that area as instructed, but remained standing in front of her, looking at her in the eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed, unable sense the kid’s thoughts at the moment. Once this child had calmed down, she could barely read her mind.</p> <p>Seeing Wu Yueling looking at her without giving any response, Lin Qiao turned around and glanced at Xie Dong, who was still floating on the water surface. Then, she stood up and put her hands on the little one’s shoulders, turning her body back to the direction of the bed and pushing her a few steps forward.</p> <p>With that, Wu Yueling began to walk forward, although she would turn back to glance at Lin Qiao with every other step before continuing to walk again.</p> <p>After seeing that Wu Yueling was finally moving forward, Lin Qiao turned around and walked toward the lake surface. She carefully observed Xie Dong’s body for a moment and then sniffed at it.</p> <p>Xie Dong was floating face-down on the water. Lin Qiao couldn’t see his face, but she sensed that both his vibe and scent had changed. His scent wasn’t the same as when he was still a human being, neither was it like the scent that he had earlier on when he suddenly turned into a zombie before jumping into the water.</p> <p>She felt that Xie Dong’s scent was a little weird.</p> <p>His human scent was gone, and his zombie scent was weak. At the moment, Lin Qiao couldn’t figure out what Xie Dong had become.</p> <p>She put her feet into the water and slowly approached him. He wasn’t floating too far from the lakeside, merely six or seven meters away. However, she hadn’t gone this far into the lake before, so she seemed to be extra careful.</p> <p>By the time she was three meters away from the lakeside, the water had already reached her chest. She immediately pushed her feet against the lake bottom and began swimming, so she could move faster through the lake.</p> <p>When she came to Xie Dong’s side, she still detected no change in him. After spending a moment in thinking, she suddenly felt a little silly!</p> <p>She didn’t know when she had become so timid. She was a zombie anyway. Was she afraid that this thing might bite her? Everything aside, with his current strength, he might not be able to bite her even if he wanted to!</p> <p>Once she thought of this, Lin Qiao boldly and confidently reached out a hand toward the guy. She turned him over, seized the collar at the back of his neck with one hand, and then swam to the lakeside while dragging him behind her.</p> <p>After swimming ashore, she dragged Xie Dong out of the water and threw him into a clearing by the lake. Now, she could finally see his face clearly.</p> <p>His face, which had been twisted and covered in veins, had actually become normal again. However, the color of his face was pale white and bluish, like the color of normal zombies.</p> <p>His mouth wasn’t cracked, neither was his nose crooked. With his eyes closed, he looked like a normal dead person, and his body seemed to show no sign of turning into a zombie.</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted beside him, examining his face over and over again as she said to herself, <em>‘Average-looking. I give him five out of ten.’</em></p> <p>After that, she reached out a hand and gripped his maxillary joints, squeezing them hard. His’s mouth opened, exposing his teeth. As she expected, his even teeth had already turned sharp.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sniffed him and found that he didn’t have the stench that zombies were supposed to have in his mouth. Letting go of his mouth, Lin Qiao took a look at his hands. His fingernails hadn’t grown out, but his finger bones had already mutated, and were bent like hooks.</p> <p>She then laid her eyes on his wounds. Those festering wounds now had a pale blue color, which was obviously an effect of the zombie virus.</p> <p>As she expected, he really had become a zombie!</p> <p>After checking for a while, Lin Qiao concluded that Xie Dong had indeed become a zombie. Then, she began considering how to deal with him next.</p> <p>Should she throw him out? He might wake up as a zombie and get shot in the head by human beings, or be torn up by higher level zombies. Alternatively, he might loiter by himself, evolve into a high-level zombie later on, and then be taken out by human beings!</p> <p>Should she directly stab her claws into his head and then go out, dig a hole, and bury him to let him rest in peace?</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that burying him was the best option!</p> <p>With this thought, she closed her eyes and looked outside, then realized that this wouldn’t work. That was because she saw the level-five zombie still staying where it was before, seemingly waiting for her to come out.</p> <p>Unless she entered that ‘traveling ghost’ state again, she wouldn’t be able to leave this place without leaving her space.</p> <p>She focussed on thinking about that magical state which she had entered earlier on and tried to remember how she had felt back then.</p> <p>She remembered that her eyes were closed at that time and she was focused on the outside situation the whole time. She had concentrated intensively and thought about how she could make herself invisible and dive down to save Xie Dong. Soon after that, she had somehow entered that half asleep and half awake, ‘traveling ghost’ state.</p> <p>As she could remember, she had been allowed to run all the way to the strawberry field without leaving the space when she was in a dream last time. Why did she have to be dreaming to achieve that? On the other hand, why did she need to enter that ‘traveling ghost’ state in order to move in the outside world without leaving her space when she wasn’t dreaming?</p> <p>Couldn’t she do that just once while she was awake? Why was this space being so difficult?</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that she needed more time to explore the functions of this space. But for now, how could she throw Xie Dong out of her space?</p> <p>Outside, the zombie leader was waiting covetously. Perhaps, it would pounce upon her as soon as she showed up.</p> <p>She had noticed that she was able to easily throw lifeless things inside or out of her space, but couldn’t do the same with human beings or zombies. Instead, she could only bring them in or out along with herself.</p> <p>While she was squatting beside Xie Dong and struggling, his still-water-like peaceful vibe suddenly stirred up. Lin Qiao sensed the change, so she immediately stood up and took a few steps backward.</p> <p>In the next moment, she saw him lying on the ground, moving his eyelids and then opening his eyes.</p> <p>His eyeballs weren’t pale gray or as dark as Lin Qiao’s black eyes which had no white parts. Instead, they were like a pair of normal human eyes, with black pupils and a normal white sclera.</p> <p>However, his pupils weren’t of the same shape as those of normal human beings. Those pupils weren’t round, but were vertical.</p> <p>None of this mattered except the fact that after he opened his eyes, he confusedly looked at the leaden sky in Lin Qiao’s space, blinking and then sitting up while fixing his alert eyes on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Seeing this, Lin Qiao was quite confused. <em>‘Damn, what’s happening now? Why is this zombie staring at me so alertly?’</em></p> <p>Before she could figure it out, Xie Dong’s expression changed again. His eyes sparkled, then the look in his eyes actually calmed down bit by bit while the vigilance in his eyes disappeared.</p> <p>Lin Qiao confusedly looked at him. Zombie? He didn’t look like one! Human being? He didn’t look like one of those either!</p> <p>What on earth had this man become?</p> <p>While she was guessing what exactly he had turned into, Xie Dong moved his lips.</p> <p>“Eh… Oh…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was again confused. She couldn’t understand the meaning behind his words at all! However, she did sense his thoughts!</p> <p>He had said, <em>‘So hungry!’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 38: Mutated Zombie": "<p>Seeing a tall and strong man weakly shouting ‘hungry’ at her, Lin Qiao found it a little unacceptable. Not to mention her, even Xie Dong was stunned after hearing himself shout ‘hungry’.</p> <p>He dropped his eyes and touched his throat, feeling a little strange. Then, he narrowed his eyes which were filled with confusion, seeming to be trying quite hard to think of something.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood aside, watching his reaction in surprise.</p> <p>Weird! It was too weird! It took time for the virus to attack, so a corpse needed at least twelve hours normally to turn into a zombie. However, from the infection to the virus attack, and then to the transformation, it took him only less than half an hour to finish the whole process. That was too damn fast!</p> <p>It was probable that the zombie virus had been strengthened, so the attack was quickened and the transformation was accelerated. However, that set aside, why did he still maintain a human face?</p> <p>The faces of the other zombies were either covered in blue or black veins, or twisted with cracked mouths and buckteeth. In any case, becoming a zombie would dramatically change one’s appearance… like what happened to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>For this reason, Wu Chengyue failed to recognize the zombie Lin Qiao as Lu Tianyu when he saw her earlier on, who had threatened him with his daughter not long ago and forced him into an unspeakable act.</p> <p>Otherwise, he would have struck her directly into ashes with a thunderbolt!</p> <p>However, Xie Dong’s face remained in good condition. The black veins had stopped bulging out of his face and had even disappeared as a matter of fact. Except for his bluish pale color, nothing was unusual about his appearance by now.</p> <p>Even his eyes hadn’t changed too much. The color of his eyes remained the same, so nobody would discover the change in his pupils unless they stared at them very carefully.</p> <p>The confused Xie Dong was trying pretty hard to think when he suddenly changed his expression and his eyes began shining with the light of disbelief.</p> <p>He abruptly raised his head to stare at Lin Qiao, then got up from the ground swiftly and neatly, searching around with his eyes. As a result, he soon had his eyes fixed on Wu Yueling who was sitting on the bed, perfectly unharmed.</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Yueling was also observing him with curiosity from a distance away.</p> <p>Seeing that Wu Yueling was fine, Xie Dong sighed in relief, then turned around and looked at Lin Qiao. After he saw that Lin Qiao was also standing at a relatively safe distance, he lowered his head to observe his own condition.</p> <p>That was when he was stunned out of his mind. He looked at himself up and down, seemingly unable to believe his eyes as he touched and pinched his body here and there with both hands.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gazed at him for quite a while. After watching his latest series of actions, a thought began to emerge in her mind.</p> <p>“Roar,” she growled at him calmly.</p> <p><em>‘Do you remember who you are?’ </em>Lin Qiao’s voice delivered a message to his mind.</p> <p>She saw Xie Dong’s expression pause briefly, following which, he immediately raised his head and stared at her. His eyes contained uncertainty, surprise, confusion, disbelief, and a number of other emotions, all blended together.</p> <p>“Eh… Ah… Goro…” He opened his mouth but could only let out a series of weird sounds. After that, he realized something and abruptly shut his mouth.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao understood what he had said.</p> <p><em>‘My name is Xie Dong,’ </em>he said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at him in shock. It turned out that this man’s name was Xie Dong. His life’s memories didn’t seem to have disappeared, as he actually remembered who he was!</p> <p>“Roar?”</p> <p><em>‘Do you remember how you died?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao continued to growl at him. Although her current way of speaking was a little strange, she felt that if she didn’t make a sound, the zombie Xie Dong wouldn’t understand her.</p> <p>Xie Dong paused for a second and then frowned. After that, his entire face twisted while a strong hatred was clearly seen in his eyes. His mouth opened upwards, exposing his sharp white teeth while the fierce intent of murder flashed in his eyes.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p><em>‘So ugly!’ </em>Lin Qiao looked and roared at him with contempt.</p> <p>The look on Xie Dong’s face paused again. Realizing that he was getting too emotional, he relaxed his expression and looked back at her helplessly.</p> <p>He really hadn’t lost his memories. He remembered everything that happened in his life before his death, including how he died! However, his memories regarding the virus attack and his transformation were a little blurry for some reason.</p> <p>But still, he did realize that he had died and become a zombie.</p> <p>He lacked body heat or a heartbeat, his entire body felt stiff and sluggish, and his skin was bluish. He couldn’t talk, but could understand the roars of this other zombie.</p> <p>All these signs seemed to tell him that he wasn’t a human being anymore!</p> <p>Furthermore…</p> <p>Xie Dong sniffed in Wu Yueling’s direction.</p> <p><em>‘She smells so good! I’m so hungry! I want to eat her so much!’</em></p> <p>Once his eyes swiveled in Wu Yueling’s direction, a figure flashed across his eyes and blocked his line of sight.</p> <p>“Roar?”</p> <p><em>‘Are you gonna eat a human?’ </em> Lin Qiao asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at him with cold eyes. She stayed vigilant in case he lost control of his zombie instincts and followed Wu Yueling’s aroma to pounce upon her. If that happened, things wouldn’t stay all hunky dory anymore.</p> <p>Xie Dong was surprised when he heard Lin Qiao’s warning growl. It was then that he realized what had just happened to him.</p> <p>The delectable smelling Wu Yueling had caused he instinctive hunger inside his body to nearly control his mind. Just now, he really had this impulse to follow her smell and rush over to her.</p> <p>He didn’t know what he would have done if this female zombie hadn’t growled out timely.</p> <p>He also felt that this female zombie’s vibe was absolutely suppressive to him. He couldn’t generate even the slightest intention to resist her, and was even very scared of her vibe, even though the latter was acting very kindly.</p> <p>Looking at her pitch-black eyes, Xie Dong couldn’t tell which level this zombie was at, but it was definitely beyond level-four. Furthermore, the message she had delivered just now did not sound like any question that a zombie would ask.</p> <p>No wonder she could stay peacefully with Chief Wu’s daughter. Was this zombie somehow special? Was she like him? Did she have her memories from before her death as well? Could she also have been a special forces soldier?</p> <p>He was thinking so much that he even showed his emotions from his eyes. Furthermore, since he had become a zombie, Lin Qiao could read his thoughts more clearly than before.</p> <p>“Roar-woo-roro…”</p> <p><em>‘I have my memories. I was indeed a special forces soldier before my death,’ </em>she said to him.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s mumbles, Xie Dong found it rather unacceptable.</p> <p>“Roar?”</p> <p><em>‘Did you read my mind?’ </em> he asked, shocked and horrified because this female zombie actually read his mind!</p> <p><em>‘What happened just now?’ </em>His eyes popped open in surprise as he gawked at Lin Qiao while asking the question in his head.</p> <p>“Roar…” Lin Qiao glanced at him, then nodded slightly and responded.</p> <p><em>‘You can’t go out yet,’ </em>she said.</p> <p>Suddenly, she felt that this conversation happening between the two of them was truly getting weird! They roared at each other, unable to talk normally at all. So strange! This felt so infuriating, making her heart so tired!</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao swept across Xie Dong with her eyes and suddenly saw the pen in the pocket of his camouflage uniform. Her eyes instantly shone and then she pointed her finger at his pocket immediately.</p>",
  "Chapter 39: Strange Communication": "<p>Xie Dong lowered his head and saw the cap of the pen pinned on the edge of his pocket. He paused briefly, then quickly understood Lin Qiao’s meaning.</p> <p>Then he took out the pen along with the small notepad in his pocket, but found that all the pages were wet and stuck together.</p> <p>“Roar?” Looking at the wet note pages, Lin Qiao roared at him.</p> <p><em>‘What about your power?’ </em>she asked</p> <p>She knew that Xie Dong had the fire power, but since he was a zombie now, she didn’t know if his power still remained the same.</p> <p>Xie Dong understood Lin Qiao’s meaning once he heard her. Meanwhile, he realized that he didn’t know what had happened to his power yet. He hadn’t thought of it until she reminded him.</p> <p>Thinking that, he slightly raised a hand and supinated his palm. On the other side, Lin Qiao also watched him with curiosity as he raised his hand with his eyes closed, seeming to be sensing something.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>They didn’t see any red flame, but a spark blasted from his palm, turning into a wisp of smoke and quickly dissipating in the air.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Xie Dong both were a little speechless on seeing that. Judging by what had happened, the situation wasn’t too bad. A spark had burst out at least, which meant that his power wasn’t gone completely.</p> <p>However, right after the smoke disappeared from Xie Dong’s palm, Lin Qiao saw the tips of his fingernails turn fiery red, although the redness faded away soon. After that, his clothes were quickly dried by his body temperature.</p> <p>His body was icy-cold just a while ago, but right now, it was burning hot, and yet he didn’t feel uncomfortable at all.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quickly walked up to him, took the notepad from his hand, and put it on his other palm which was still smoky. Then, she raised a hand toward him, signaling him to try it again.</p> <p>Xie Dong hesitated a little. He couldn’t control the heat of his body anymore or even start a fire. He didn’t know if this would work or not.</p> <p>“Roar!” Lin Qiao sensed his hesitation, so she impatiently gave him a roar.<em>‘Hurry up!’ </em>she said.</p> <p>Xie Dong couldn’t resist her order, so he immediately tried to concentrate the heat of his entire body onto his hand.</p> <p>In less than two seconds, Lin Qiao abruptly reached out and grabbed away the notepad from his palm. After that, another puffing noise could be heard, followed by another wisp of smoke rising up.</p> <p>By that moment, the notepad in Lin Qiao’s hand had already dried up.</p> <p>If she hadn’t seen so clearly and moved so swiftly, this notepad would have started burning in his palm within the next second.</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at his own hand sullenly without knowing what to say. His power had actually been reduced to this. He was used to having a strong power, so he found this current state extremely frustrating.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t care how he felt for the time being. She took the pen which had also been soaked by the water, and drew a few lines on a piece of paper. After trying and finding that the pen was still usable, she immediately wrote down a few lines and showed them to him.</p> <p><em>‘My name is Lin Qiao. You’re in my space now. That zombie leader is still waiting outside, so neither of us can go out yet. Is there something you want to do?’</em></p> <p>Reading her handwriting, he found it to be sharp and strong, with every character seeming to contain a blade or sword. He gazed at his hands in a daze for a moment, and after she handed the paper to him, he finally gave a response.</p> <p>A trace of murderous hate flashed across Xie Dong’s eyes. He wanted to kill those who had betrayed him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed his thoughts and quickly wrote down some more lines.</p> <p><em>‘Go out and kill them if that’s what you want. You now look just like a human being anyway. As long as you don’t speak, the others won’t know that you’re already dead. The level-five zombie outside may have lost interest in you by now.’</em></p> <p>Reading the last sentence, Xie Dong felt speechless. Before he could react, Lin Qiao wrote down another sentence.</p> <p><em>‘But of course, we don’t know if it will kill you and snack on your zombie nucleus, as it’s clearly angry.’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong really didn’t know what to say after reading that.</p> <p>At this moment, Lin Qiao suddenly pressed her hand onto his shoulder, then both of them disappeared from her space. In the next moment, she reappeared in the same spot without the latter.</p> <p>And at that very same moment, Xie Dong was stunned to find himself alone in a different place within the blink of an eye.</p> <p>Damn! He had been thrown out by the female zombie! She had left him here alone… to face a terrifying level-five zombie!</p> <p>Looking at the familiar red-eyed zombie which flashed out from not too far away, Xie Dong even wanted to go back and give Lin Qiao a bite.</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! Why did she throw me out alone? To feed the zombie leader? The zombie leader doesn’t even want to eat me anymore! She threw me out for the zombie leader to torture, didn’t she?’</em></p> <p>Even though he wanted to go out of her space to find the traitorous b*stards and take revenge, he absolutely didn’t want to be out here right now! Looking at the zombie leader who was already flying at him, Xie Dong even began to scream in his heart.</p> <p>The zombie leader rushed over at him but stopped a short distance away. It stared at him with a confused expression, its pair of eyes sparkling with an evil and wild red light.</p> <p>Xie Dong was frightened when the zombie leader approached him, He took a few steps backward but dared not to turn and run. Because its vibe was even stronger than Lin Qiao’s and had been oppressing him firmly, he couldn’t even generate the slightest urge to resist and run.</p> <p>This was a suppression of power from a higher-level existence to a lower-level one.</p> <p>If Xie Dong had known that he was being thrown out by Lin Qiao as a bait, he might really have given her a bite.</p> <p>At that same moment, Lin Qiao was squatting by the lake, her eyes closed to observe the situation outside. Seeing the zombie leader rush to Xie Dong but stop at a short distance away, she sighed slightly in relief.</p> <p>It seemed that the zombie leader had rushed out just now only because it smelled her. However, when it saw that it was Xie Dong and noted that he no longer had the aroma of edible human beings, having become a zombie just like itself, it paused with a slight confusion. Even its aggression had been tempered considerably.</p> <p>It also knew that any human being who was bitten or scratched by zombies but wasn’t eaten immediately would become one of their kind in half a day.</p> <p>However, this former human being in front of it seemed to have transformed too quickly! Not long ago, he smelled delicious like human flesh, unlike the current him that smelled just like any other zombie. He was at a very low-level, so the zombie leader wasn’t even interested in his zombie nucleus.</p> <p>The zombie leader slowly walked over and circled around Xie Dong. It found his vibe to be a little weird and couldn’t tell why, but it didn’t care about that at the moment.</p> <p>It was looking for that particular strange vibe which belonged to the one who had snatched its food. Of course, it didn’t know that the one it was looking for had been watching its every move with her eyes closed.</p> <p>After making a few circles and finding no trace of Lin Qiao or her vibe, the zombie leader was irritated. It abruptly turned around and slapped Xie Dong with its claw, sending him flying through the air.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Xie Dong had no time to react before he found himself flying in the air. As he thudded against the ground, he heard the zombie leader burst into a series of furious roars.</p> <p>“Roarrrr!”</p> <p>After that, the zombie leader turned around and suddenly jumped very high, stepping on the wall in front of it and leaping upward. Soon, it jumped on top of the twenty story building which was next to the one it had climbed just now and disappeared.</p>",
  "Chapter 40: An Act of Vengeance": "<p>Xie Dong lay on the ground as he moved his hands and feet for a while, trying to get up. However, he failed in the end, so he just kept lying on the floor.</p> <p>On the other side, it seemed that the zombie leader had lost its patience to keep waiting here.</p> <p>After lying on the ground for a while, Xie Dong finally felt that he had regained control of his limbs, so he slowly sat up and took a breath of relief. He was apparently safe now.</p> <p>He had to worry about being attacked by zombies when he was human. Unexpectedly,, he actually still needed to worry about the same problem even after becoming a zombie himself!</p> <p>How difficult life was in the post-apocalyptic world!</p> <p>At that moment, a figure appeared at the same spot where he showed up earlier.</p> <p>It was Lin Qiao who had appeared out of thin air. She walked over to Xie Dong with the notepad and showed him what was written on it.</p> <p><em>‘Do you have a map? A car?’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong stood up from the ground and read her note, then raised his head to look at her in confusion, his eyes asking a question.</p> <p><em>‘What do you need a map and a car for?’</em></p> <p>The communication between Xie Dong and Lin Qiao was more than a little strange. He could deliver any thought to her by simply looking at her, but he had to read the words she wrote on the paper to find out what she was thinking!</p> <p>He had a feeling that he was at quite a disadvantage!</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him, ignoring his thoughts as she started to write on the paper again.</p> <p><em>‘To go to the bases in the South and look for somebody.’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong nodded, understanding her goal. He didn’t have a map with him at the moment, but he could borrow one from others. He remembered that Huang Xiao and his men all had maps. As for the man with space power, Xie Dong didn’t know what all he had in his space.</p> <p>Furthermore, he happened to have a car that must be currently in those people’s hands.</p> <p>Thinking all this, he nodded at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>The two of them had a short discussion, after which, they decided to go to find Xie Dong ‘s teammates who had betrayed him and take revenge first. They were zombies now, so it was much easier for them to find someone.</p> <p>In fact, Lin Qiao had located those people long ago. Back when the level-five zombie leader was still chasing after Xie Dong, who hadn’t turned into a zombie yet, those people had sneakily come out of that man’s space and then left quickly.</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t notice any of this back then because he was too busy dealing with the zombie leader. However, Lin Qiao, who was observing the situation from inside her space at the time, had seen them and memorized the direction they were moving in.</p> <p>Xie Dong saw her walk to an alley without hesitation, wondering why she was so sure that it was the right way. So, he reached out a hand behind her and patted on her shoulder.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back to look at him, her eyes revealing a questioning look.</p> <p><em>‘How do you know they went this way?’ </em>Xie Dong was also asking her a question silently with his eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao lowered her head and began writing on a piece of paper.</p> <p><em>‘I saw them go this way earlier on. If you want to find them soon, cut the crap and move along with me now!’</em></p> <p>Once she finished writing, she directly threw the paper at Xie Dong’s chest, then gave him a disdainful glance with her pure black eyes which lacked any hint of white, leaving him feeling despised without knowing what to say.</p> <p>Xie Dong saw her continue moving forward and had no choice but to follow her silently. He suddenly thought of one other thing, so he again walked up and patted her on the shoulder.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stopped walking and turned back. <em>‘Why hadn’t I found this man so garrulous before?’ </em></p> <p>This time, Xie Dong didn’t manage to figure out the meaning in Lin Qiao’s eyes. He could only point at his thigh’s level with his hand and ask her a question in his mind.</p> <p><em>‘Aren’t you gonna send Chief Wu’s daughter back? He must be going crazy by now!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao sneered. The expression on her face was quite weird.</p> <p><em>‘Send her back? Hehe… I plan to take the little one away! I won’t give her back to that man! It would be even better if he does go crazy! He shouldn’t have struck me indiscriminately with lightning!’ </em>she thought.</p> <p>She wrote on the paper, <em>‘Stay out of this. Anyhow, the little girl won’t die or be eaten by me.’</em></p> <p>Having finished writing, she gave Xie Dong a threatening glance, then turned around and kept walking.</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t dare to ask her any more questions this time as he received a pressure that made him feel being warned by her last glance.</p> <p>…</p> <p>As two zombies, Xie Dong and Lin Qiao walked casually in the alley. The shambling zombies around them either ignored or avoided them because of Lin Qiao’s vibe.</p> <p>Xie Dong had never walked so calmly in a crowd of zombies. Before, he was always nervously on guard against zombie attacks, but now, it was the other zombies that avoided him on sight. This sharp contrast gave him a novel and strange feeling.</p> <p>After proceeding along the road for a while, Lin Qiao suddenly stopped before a fork road, then raised her nose to sniff the air, seemingly confirming the direction. Xie Dong watched her do this and tried to do the same, but smelled nothing.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sniffed for only a few times before she pointed to the left and began heading that way.</p> <p>She knew that she had been able to smell all human beings within one kilometer around her earlier on. When Wu Chengyue arrived with his army, she had grasped a strong human smell from a long distance away.</p> <p>However, she now felt that the scope of her sense of smell had grown, although she still needed to confirm that.</p> <p>The geographical condition of this region wasn’t ideal. The surrounding area was blocked by buildings, as a result of which, a considerable number of odors which she could have smelled might have been blocked out by the buildings.</p> <p>Ling Qiao took Xie Dong to somewhere behind a wall after taking a few turns. Then, she stopped and kept looking forward while giving a hint to Xie Dong by making a hand gesture behind her back.</p> <p>Xie Dong’s eyes glowed with an intense focus on receiving Lin Qiao’s hint. What Lin Qiao’s gesture meant was that the target had shown up and he should get ready to move.</p> <p>After that, Xie Dong saw her raise a hand and make a few gestures in a row with her body remaining motionless. He immediately relaxed his facial expression when saw her gestures and began acting like a normal person, only with his eyes slightly narrowed. When he was ready to move, Lin Qiao suddenly swung her arm and threw a black rifle into his hands.</p> <p>It was his gun that had been left in her space.</p> <p>When he received his gun, he had a strange feeling in his heart.</p> <p>When he lost his gun earlier on, he had also lost his life. However, his life was back now, and so was his gun. Although it had only been a few hours, his life had changed into another form irreversibly.</p> <p>While he was protecting the others, all that he got in return was their betrayal. He had used up his power and energy to defend them against the zombies, but they kicked him into the zombie crowd in the end as a ‘repayment’. He had thought that the zombies would eat him or dig out his energy nucleus, but he was ironically saved by a zombie, and then became a zombie himself.</p> <p>It was weird that he had become a zombie with his intact old memories and an unchanged body.</p> <p>With a complicated feeling in his heart, he looked at his hands which were holding the gun and wondered if his claws were also carrying the virus or not.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao saw him still being in a daze, she suddenly raised a foot and kicked him directly on his butt, sending him staggering forward.</p> <p>Kicked by Lin Qiao, Xie Dong leaped forward and finally realized what had happened. In the next instant, he changed his expression and quietly moved toward another building not far ahead with an aura of brutal ferocity.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had shown him the precise location of his teammates by making the gestures earlier.</p> <p>At this moment, the people in the building had no idea that the man they believed to have died in the hands of the zombies was approaching them with a monstrous killing intent.</p>",
  "Chapter 41: The Reason of Betrayal": "<p>“Brother Xiao, we got Xie Dong killed this time, so no one will shield us from the zombies next time!” At the moment, the four were hiding in a room in this small building; sitting almost equally spaced from each other and talking.</p> <p>Huang Xiao smiled carelessly and said, “What are you afraid of? Xie Dong’s fire wall is gone, but have you forgotten my tornado? Besides, my power is going to upgrade soon. Without Xie Dong, the position of Captain will just be mine.”</p> <p>“Hehe… You’re right. Our Brother Xiao is no worse than Xie Dong. We let Xie Dong be the Captain, but he took the best of our earnings every time. What we got was always ridiculously little.”</p> <p>“Yeah, yeah! He got all the good things each time. And that woman in the base, she should have belonged to our Brother Xiao, but he seduced her with food. Without him, she would have been in our Brother Xiao’s bed long ago!”</p> <p>Speaking of that woman, Huang Xiao had his face darkened, followed by a strong jealousy flashing across his eyes.</p> <p>But soon, he began laughing as he said with pride, “Women… As long as I have the resources, isn’t it easy to get them into my bed? Besides, as Xie Dong is no longer with us, who will stop me when I’m back? She doesn’t want to be with me, but so what? I can do whatever I want to her, can’t I? I can sleep with her whenever I want, ah-hum…Haha…”</p> <p>At the end of his speech, he began laughing with a creepy look that any man could understand.</p> <p>“Haha…You’re right!” The others glanced at each other and laughed together. Their laughter contained the same special meaning.</p> <p>“Brother Xiao, when you return to the base and absorb all the zombie and energy nuclei we now have, you should be able to break into level four, right? Level-four wind power is much more useful than fire power. One wind blade can cut off a zombie’s head, which’ll be much more effective than Xie Dong’s fireballs,” said a level-two superpowered one flatteringly.</p> <p>Hearing this, Huang Xiao laughed and responded proudly, “I would have finished him off long ago if his level-four fire wall hadn’t been holding off quite some zombies and saving us a lot of efforts. But fortunately, we had him with us that time, so we could stall the zombie leader with him. Otherwise, we wouldn’t even have had the time to enter the space!”</p> <p>The other three people nodded quickly with a lingering fear. Their faces involuntarily paled when they thought of that zombie leader.</p> <p>“Exactly! I had never thought we could be so unlucky. We actually ran into a zombie leader which could hardly be encountered by the others. It’s a shame that the zombie leader was at its peak of power, and we were no match for it, or we would have made a great fortune with its nucleus!”</p> <p>“You’re right!”</p> <p>Speaking of the zombie leader’s nucleus, the others showed a greedy look in their eyes as well.</p> <p>Holding a bottle of water, Huang Xiao took a sip and said regretfully, “Unfortunately, we didn’t get Xie Dong’s energy nucleus either…Such a loss! A level-four energy nucleus is enough for me to break into level-four.”</p> <p>At that moment, none of the men in the room managed to discover that Xie Dong was grinding his teeth while listening to their conversation behind the closed door. His eyes bulged, veins standing out on each side of his forehead while his fists were clenched tightly.</p> <p>He couldn’t have imagined that in addition to the betrayal, Huang Xiao also wanted his energy nucleus, and had been casting greedy eyes on his woman!</p> <p>‘Very well! A bunch of damnable ungrateful souls!’ He cursed silently.</p> <p>In the room, Huang Xiao and the others were feeling pity for not getting Xie Dong’s energy when they got him killed.</p> <p>Bang—Clang!</p> <p>A sudden noise was heard from the door as it was kicked open by someone with an incredible force, which was great enough to send the iron door flying into the room and make it fall on the ground loudly.</p> <p>The four in the room immediately leaped up, alertly pointing their weapons at the door as quickly as possible. However, they didn’t fire their guns right away, because they saw a familiar figure standing by the door.</p> <p>“Xie Dong! You’re not dead!” One of them shouted out loud in astonishment once he clearly saw that it was Xie Dong standing by the door.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>All that responded him was a bullet.</p> <p>That man stared at his own chest as he failed to immediately realize what was happening. In confusion, he watched his own blood gushing out of the bullet hole in his chest, and seeping into his clothes.</p> <p>Xie Dong closed his eyes and took a deep breath. The aroma of blood immediately boosted the sense of hunger in his stomach; meanwhile, a voice sounded in his mind.</p> <p>‘Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!’</p> <p>Right at this moment, an air blade sliced through the air and flew at him. Xie Dong slightly turned his head and dodged that air blade without even opening his eyes.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>The air blade left a deep cut on the wall behind him.</p> <p>“Xie Dong? Haha… Aren’t you dead? Great! I was feeling a little pity for letting that zombie leader have your energy nucleus, but I didn’t expect that you’d actually survive! However, that’s not the point! The point is…you brought yourself back to die…Hahaha!”</p> <p>He wasn’t showing any look of guilt. On the contrary, he seemed relaxed, because he didn’t need to try so hard pretending anymore. This had turned into an open fight, an encounter of enemies.</p> <p>Xie Dong blocked the voice in his head with an effort, struggling to make himself ignore that tempting sweet aroma. Enduring the sense of hunger, he stared at Huang Xiao with a dark face when his hands moved suddenly, firing his gun at another person.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>“Em… Xie Dong, you…” That person didn’t think that Xie Dong would actually divert his attention and launch a lethal attack on him while staring at Huang Xiao. And the worst part was, he wasn’t preparing for Xie Dong’s attack at all. Before he could dodge, a bullet hit him in the heart; his teammate who got shot the first was shot in the heart as well.</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t even glance at him, but continued staring at Huang Xiao coldly. He didn’t react too much to Huang Xiao’s pretentious words, and he surely wouldn’t say a word to wrangle with him.</p> <p>After all, he could not talk at that moment in the slightest bit!</p> <p>After shooting the second man dead, Xie Dong turned the gun on Huang Xiao.</p> <p>Huang Xiao ignored his gun and laughed coldly, “As a level-four superpowered man, you’re holding a gun? Let me guess…Is it because your superpower has run out and not recovered yet? Haha…Do you think you can defeat me with a shitty gun?”</p> <p>He didn’t say ‘us’, as he had left the other three out of his side by now. Two of them had died anyway, and the last one was completely ignorable.</p> <p>While speaking, Huang Xiao raised both hands and started a wild wind around his body. The one who hadn’t been shot by Xie Dong was standing aside all this time.</p> <p>This man who wasn’t killed immediately by Xie Dong originally didn’t have a superpower. At least, he wasn’t a superpowered one in the eyes of the rest of the team. But earlier on, he had disappeared along with Huang Xiao and the others.</p>",
  "Chapter 42: Sudden Attack": "<p>Xie Dong merely glanced at him before concluding that he was the one with the space power. He recalled from before and realized that Huang Xiao and the others had always been protecting this man, intentionally or not. He never noticed anything abnormal at that time, and just thought that they were close.</p> <p>Now, as he rethought everything, he figured out that it was actually because those few people had known about this man’s space power since long ago.</p> <p>This man drew back to a corner, intending to avoid the battlezone created by Xie Dong and Huang Xiao.</p> <p>However, right at this moment, he saw something flash across the air with the corner of his eye. He turned his head to see a figure flash into the window behind Huang Xiao. It reached behind Huang Xiao’s back within a blink while completely ignoring the wild wind around his body, then directly reached out a hand and inserted its sharp claws into the back of Huang Xiao’s head.</p> <p>This figure then nimbly waved its arm, sending Huang Xiao flying out along with his wind without even letting him moan in pain. With that, half of his skull remained in this creature’s hand.</p> <p>The space-powered man widely opened his eyes and watched this unexpected scene. Meanwhile, he clearly saw this figure which shot in through the window, and found that it was a female zombie.</p> <p>Right after the female zombie threw Huang Xiao out, the space-powered man raised his gun and fired at her almost reflexively. But, the zombie caught the bullet with her palm by merely clenching her fingers.</p> <p>Seeing this, the space-powered man was dumbfounded. And before he realized what happened, the zombie moved again.</p> <p>It flashed across the air and disappeared; but in the following half a second, it appeared right next to him and grasped his arm with a claw. Next, he felt that he was flying in the air with his eyes dazzled.</p> <p>When he came back to himself, the scenery before his eyes had changed.</p> <p>He was standing by a small lake.</p> <p>After that, he felt his arm being loosened, and then noticed that a zombie was standing by his side!</p> <p>He subconsciously drew back and raised his gun. However, a hand suddenly gripped his gun before he fired. Then, the gun was gone as he felt his hands being shaken!</p> <p>He immediately turned his head toward the hand, and saw Xie Dong standing a meter away from him, holding his gun and swinging it in circles.</p> <p>“Xie Dong! What are you doing! Why don’t you deal with this zombie? Why did you seize my gun?” The space-powered man blew a fuse once he found out that Xie Dong was the one who had taken away his gun.</p> <p>He believed that even though internal contradictions now existed between them, he and Xie Dong should still fight against the female zombie together. After all, when facing a zombie, people should always deal with it first and only then settle their internal problems.</p> <p>This had gradually become a rule since the post-apocalyptic era started. As for things like Huang Xiao sending his teammate into zombies’ mouths, it could only be explained as the most common dark stuff in this post-apocalyptic world. Of course, this kind of thing was an exception.</p> <p>This space-powered man just hadn’t gotten a clear understanding of his situation yet. He subconsciously wanted Xie Dong’s protection like before once he encountered a danger, but forgot about the fact that he had betrayed Xie Dong not long ago, and that he had joined hands with the others to push him into a crowd of zombies.</p> <p>Hearing his words, Xie Dong said nothing but coldly turned up his mouth corners, standing where he was while looking at him with a sneer.</p> <p>Seeing the sneer on Xie Dong’s face, the space-powered man finally recalled that he had betrayed Xie Dong earlier on, and paused shortly.</p> <p>So, no one would protect him now! He was just a space-powered man, and before the old world ended, he was no more than an office worker; he was never a strong fighter. He managed to survive in this post-apocalyptic world only by relying on others’ protection. Fortunately, he activated the highly useful space power later on, and that earned him the protection of Huang Xiao and his people.</p> <p>However, Huang Xiao died seconds ago, so he had fallen into a situation with no protector by now.</p> <p>At this moment, Lin Qiao threw a crystal piece which was in her hand to Xie Dong. When Xie Dong caught it, she flashed before the space-powered man’s face and gripped his throat.</p> <p>“Eh… Eh… Aw…” As his throat was squeezed, the space-powered man was immediately disabled from breathing, and instantly realized what was happening. Once he saw the pair of black eyes staring straight at him, he began shaking right away because of fear, even forgetting to struggle. His entire face was reddened while he couldn’t breathe, his eyes filled with despair and fright when looking at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gazed into his eyes, clearly sensing his thoughts.</p> <p><em>‘I-I-I’m gonna die… I’m gonna be eaten by this zombie… She’ll bite off my face… My stomach will be ripped open, and my heart and guts will be dug out to be eaten… This is so terrible… This is just so terrifying…’</em></p> <p>Reading this man’s mind, Lin Qiao was amused. This man had been giving himself scary thoughts. She had no intention to do anything to him, yet he had been making himself picture these horrible scenes. He was scaring himself to death, wasn’t he?</p> <p>At this point, she picked up a small piece of paper, with one single word written on it.</p> <p><em> ‘Space.’</em></p> <p>Next, she put the piece of paper before the space-powered man’s eyes for him to read. She planned to make him hand out everything in his space and then let him go.</p> <p>But as a result, when this man, who was under fear and panic, suddenly saw the word ‘space’, Lin Qiao immediately sensed the energy nucleus in his head, which seemed to have an opening in it.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, she directly saw everything inside that energy nucleus.</p> <p><em> ‘En? Eh? Damn! What is going on?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was dumbfounded right now, having no idea why this would happen. How could she possibly see inside another person’s space? Wasn’t the owner of a space the only one who was able to peer inside it?</p> <p>She closed her eyes shortly with confusion, feeling that the opening of the space-powered man’s space had grown larger after she did. The enlarged opening allowed her to see more clearly than before, but when she reopened her eyes, the opening began shrinking.</p> <p>She then looked at this space-powered man’s face and found that he was already showing the whites of his eyes, seeming to have fainted.</p> <p>Seeing this, Lin Qiao was left a little speechless.</p> <p>She really hadn’t done this on purpose!</p> <p>In the next instant, she relaxed her grip in shock, then watched the space-powered man fell softly to the ground. Meanwhile, she felt that the opening of his space had been closed.</p> <p>She turned her head confusedly and glanced at Xie Dong, finding him looking at her also with confusion.</p> <p>However, Xie Dong had more puzzles in his eyes.</p> <p>Why did Lin Qiao suddenly rush into the room and kill Huang Xiao? Didn’t she say that she would let him take revenge for himself? And why did she bring him and this space-powered man inside her space? What had she done to him? Was this man scared senseless by her?</p> <p>These sudden changes weren’t in conformance with what she had told him earlier, causing him to feel seriously perplexed.</p> <p>After looking into his eyes and learning his thoughts, Lin Qiao took out a piece of paper and quickly wrote down a sentence.</p> <p><em> ‘Level-five zombie showed up outside.’</em></p> <p>This single sentence explained the sudden move that she made just now.</p> <p>Outside her space, a figure swiftly leaped over from a distance like a fierce beast right after Lin Qiao dragged the two inside.</p>",
  "Chapter 43: Space-Powered Man": "<p>The reason Lin Qiao suddenly rushed in and quickly finished Huang Xiao, then brought the two into her space, was because she had sensed a level-five zombie leader with a familiar vibe approaching.</p> <p>Apparently, this was the same zombie leader they had encountered earlier on. And clearly, this zombie leader had caught Lin Qiao’s smell and followed it to this area.</p> <p>As the level-five zombie leader had much sharper senses than Lin Qiao did, it sensed her not long after she exited her space.</p> <p>Looking at the space-powered man who was lying on the ground, Lin Qiao wondered what exactly had happened just now. Why was she able to see inside this man’s space? Was this another ability of hers?</p> <p>Suddenly, she found that after she became a zombie, she had acquired so many abilities that she didn’t have before!</p> <p>Telepathy, space, space invisibility… Apart from these, the strength of her body had grown over five times greater than before. And now, she had developed one more ability, that allowed her to sense the spaces of other people!</p> <p>However, all these abilities weren’t practiced, and couldn’t yet be used with great facility.</p> <p>This space of hers was too mystical. She could bring people in, and the lake water in this space appeared to have numerous effects. Aside from that, this space seemed to have other uses as well that she had yet to discover.</p> <p>Regarding telepathy, she found that she was able to quickly learn the thoughts of the zombies at lower levels than herself; but when facing higher level zombies, it was quite difficult for her to do the same. As for the thoughts of human beings, it seemed that she needed to approach quite close to sense them.</p> <p>As for space invisibility, she honestly didn’t know how to use that skill.</p> <p>And now, she didn’t know how her new ability to sense others’ spaces worked either. She needed to do more experiments!</p> <p>With this thought, Lin Qiao grabbed the space-powered man’s collar, directly dragged him to the lake, and then pressed his head into the water.</p> <p>In a minute, the space-powered man began struggling.</p> <p>Seeing that he was awake, Lin Qiao seized his collar and lifted him up, then threw him to the lakeside.</p> <p>“Em… Eh-hem-hem-hem… Pah…” The space-power man had inhaled quite a lot of water, so he now lay on the ground while coughing in an awful shape.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t give him any time to process what had just happened, but squatted in front of him, reached out a hand and spread out her fingers, gripping his forehead.</p> <p>Choking on the water, the space-powered man suddenly felt a hand pressing on his forehead before his mind got clear again. Next, a sudden dizziness overpowered him, and he started feeling drowsy.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed something once her hand touched the space-powered man’s head. She closed her eyes and saw a white fog, as well as a round opening in it, about as big as a window.</p> <p>As she tried to get a little closer to the opening, it brought itself toward her as well.</p> <p>She clearly saw plenty of daily supplies and some food in it. She and Xie Dong didn’t need the food, but Wu Yueling did.</p> <p>She pulled out and opened her eyes, finding that the space-powered man who was grabbed in her hand had again rolled his eyes back in his head. This time, he suffered so much worse than before that was even foaming at the mouth.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hurriedly loosened her hand, her eyes glimmering. It seemed that by looking into his space, she had imposed a great stress on his body or his mind.</p> <p>At this point, Xie Dong walked over while looking at the space-powered man with icy cold eyes. He even had a desire to take a bite of this man’s flesh, but he suppressed it.</p> <p>He held the crystal nucleus and concentrated the heat of his entire body in his palm like how he did when he absorbed a zombie nucleus, sensing how it started melting. Next, he clenched his fingers, and the crystal nucleus instantly transformed into a wave of energy that seeped into his body through his palm, merging with the heat which was concentrated in his palm and then returning into his body along with it.</p> <p>Having finished absorbing the crystal nucleus, he saw Lin Qiao relax her grip on the space-powered man. But this time, the space-power man seemed to be in a much worse condition, foaming at the mouth.</p> <p>Seeing Xie Dong walk over, Lin Qiao picked up a piece of paper and wrote down a few words.</p> <p><em> ‘Did the crystal nucleus bring any change to you?’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong spent a moment in feeling his body and then shook his head. He felt nothing; it was like the energy contained in Huang Xiao’s crystal nucleus had disappeared inside his body. He didn’t feel his power increasing like the way he felt back when he absorbed the zombie nuclei.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him with surprise. Nothing seemed to change when she absorbed the zombie nuclei either. She thought that it was due to her constitution, but how come Xie Dong was the same as her?</p> <p>After getting closer by now, Xie Dong looked at the space-powered man who had fainted again. He stared straight at him, swallowing his saliva all the time.</p> <p>He sensed the sweet aroma once he approached the other. The sense of hunger then surged crazily, making him so eager to take a bite. However, his sanity had been telling him that it was the scent of human flesh. Thinking of feeding on human flesh, he felt sick mentally.</p> <p>On the one hand, his body had been suffering the physical hunger, and on the other hand, his mind had been bearing the feeling of disgust. This difficult situation made him terribly uncomfortable.</p> <p>Seeing him like this, Lin Qiao knew that he was tempted by his instinctive hunger. She thought about it and then wrote down a few sentences on the paper.</p> <p><em> ‘If you want to eat him, I won’t stop you. After all, eating human beings is a normal and instinctive reaction of zombies. And human flesh can provide the energy that zombies need.’</em></p> <p>Reading this, Xie Dong paused for a while to understand the meaning. Once he got the meaning of those words, he immediately and confirmedly shook his head, then turned around and walked far away.</p> <p>Looking at him from behind, Lin Qiao suddenly felt bleak and lonely.</p> <p>These days, she had gradually gotten used to being a zombie, but this man hadn’t yet accepted the truth that he was a zombie, had he? Many things had changed, but he didn’t realize them yet.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was an optimistic and receptive person with strong adaptability.</p> <p>She had become a zombie, so be it. She was still who she was, and she was still going to find her family and friends. Even if she couldn’t show up right in front of them, she needed to see that they were doing well even from a long distance away, so that she could at least stop worrying about them.</p> <p>She was a special forces soldier before, and often carried out dangerous missions which could cost her life at any time. Her family had accepted that and prepared themselves mentally since long ago. Therefore, she now saw herself as dead in a mission, but was still able to live around the ones she loved with another identity, and that was just enough.</p> <p>For this reason, she still needed to go back to find her family.</p> <p>However, Xie Dong wasn’t the same. He wasn’t as open-minded as her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t care about him though. The two of them would soon go on their separate ways anyway. As for what would happen to Xie Dong, that was his own business, and she couldn’t say a thing about it. After all, they had nothing to do with each other, and no affection existed between them either.</p> <p>She saved him only because she didn’t want to watch him, who was also a special forces soldier, be killed by his own teammates just like that.</p> <p>In the army, soldiers trained every single day, and the team spirit had always been highly essential. The trust of a soldier in their comrades was important, and vice versa. Therefore, all special forces soldiers hated and rejected the betrayal between teammates just the same.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao was hindered by the lack of strength, so the rescue from her came a little too late.</p> <p>If she were able to defeat that level-five zombie leader, she wouldn’t have failed to save a person before he was harmed.</p> <p>Hence, she increasingly wanted to grow stronger!</p>",
  "Chapter 44: Played Him to Death": "<p>The first priority now was to make this space-powered man surrender all he had in his space.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t think what she was going to do was wrong, as taking over the weapons and other useful belongings of the enemies was what she and her soldier friends were required to do back in the army. She did such kind of things quite often before, not to mention in this post-apocalyptic world.</p> <p>Perhaps, bullying the weak was a little shameless, but this man had hurt someone else, hadn’t he? Besides, Lin Qiao didn’t plan on killing him.</p> <p>Looking at this man who had fallen unconscious again, Lin Qiao had no other choice but to press his head down into the water once again.</p> <p>After passing out and waking back up for several times, this space-powered man was exhausted. His breath had become feeble, and his mind wasn’t clear anymore.</p> <p>Neither she nor Xie Dong could talk, but she kept showing the space-powered man one sentence written on the paper.</p> <p><em> ‘Bring out everything in your space!’</em></p> <p>However, maybe because this space-powered man was terrified, or because he was muddleheaded for some other reason, he made absolutely no reaction to this sentence.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could clearly sense his space every single time, but wasn’t able to enter it no matter how hard she tried. When her mind got close to the opening of his space, she would feel an invisible screen blocking her way. Therefore, she could only see into it, but couldn’t touch the things inside.</p> <p>At last, the space-powered man was accidentally killed by her…</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a while staring at the space-powered man who suddenly lost his breath and heartbeat, then turned to Xie Dong with an innocent look. At that moment, Xie Dong had just come back to see what happened.</p> <p><em> ‘Sorry, I made a mistake.’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t know how to respond.</p> <p>Lin Qiao never expected this man to die suddenly. She thought that he was just fainted like the last couple of times, and would wake back up if she soaked his head into the water again. But unexpectedly, he never woke up again.</p> <p>Once he died, she could no longer sense the opening of his space.</p> <p>She glanced at Xie Dong awkwardly. After all, this man was his enemy instead of hers.</p> <p>Xie Dong was cool with it though, because Lin Qiao could be counted as his lifesaver anyhow. It didn’t matter that Lin Qiao accidentally killed this man, but it was a pity indeed that the items were no longer accessible.</p> <p>As of now, when a space-powered person died, no one would ever be able to obtain the things in his or her space. Therefore, all space-powered people had a reason to survive for now.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the dead space-powered man, then looked at Wu Yueling, who had been watching her and Xie Dong from a distance.</p> <p>Wu Yueling had been standing at a distance instead of getting close ever since Lin Qiao and the other two showed up. She seemed to be quite afraid of Xie Dong, who was standing beside Lin Qiao. It was not because he was a zombie, but because Wu Yueling was never used to being close to people. Even back in the base, she would only let Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue near her, but wouldn’t even talk to Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Being close with Lin Qiao was an exception to her, and it didn’t mean that she could also be close with the others around Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could still sense the space-powered man’s space. Even though he had died, his space didn’t disappear, but seemed to remain inside his crystal nucleus.</p> <p>She now had an urge to dig out his crystal nucleus directly and study it. However, as she realized that that would be a little savage, she remembered that she had this little person in her space.</p> <p>She certainly couldn’t let a child witness her digging into someone’s skull!</p> <p>However, she couldn’t exit her space at the time; once she closed her eyes, she could see the level-five zombie wandering in the room where Huang Xiao and the others were hiding earlier, looking for something.</p> <p>Apart from the level-five zombie, two level-three zombies were standing in the corners obediently as well.</p> <p>The mouths and teeth of these three zombies were all covered in blood, and the three bloody corpses in the room were now lying on the ground with emptied stomachs and skulls.</p> <p>The zombies in this post-apocalyptic world did not only like to eat human flesh and drink human blood, but also especially enjoyed feeding on human brains. High-level zombies liked to eat human internal organs, and of course, brains as well.</p> <p>Therefore, corpses with emptied stomachs and skulls were often discovered since the apocalyptic era began. People would know at first sight that those corpses were chewed by zombies.</p> <p>At a glance, Lin Qiao knew that the level-five zombie had been looking for her, because this zombie spent a relatively long time lingering around the window that she showed up at.</p> <p>This zombie was really persistent! It actually kept chasing her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was even a little speechless about that.</p> <p>Since she couldn’t go outside, she had no choice but to do it inside her space. As she couldn’t let the little one witness this, she decided to let Xie Dong block Wu Yueling’s line of sight.</p> <p>She wrote down a sentence on the paper, then handed it to Xie Dong.</p> <p>After reading the sentence, Xie Dong immediately walked up behind Lin Qiao and covered her. He faced Wu Yueling, letting her see only himself and not what Lin Qiao was doing behind him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao cast a glance backward, but didn’t see Wu Yueling. After that, she reached out her claw and neatly cut open the space-powered man’s head.</p> <p>Earlier on, she had sensed a strong aroma when she cut off Huang Xiao’s head. But back then, she needed to take out the crystal nucleus very quickly and bring Xie Dong and the space-powered man into her space right after that. So, she didn’t get the time to sense that aroma carefully.</p> <p>But now, once she cut open his head, she sensed the same aroma. No wonder the other zombies liked to eat brains. The scent of human brains wasn’t the same as the scent of human flesh.</p> <p>The aroma of human flesh was sweet, but the scent of human brains was refreshing. However, human brains seemed to be more delicious than flesh. Nobody could question it, because it was her instinctual ability to tell.</p> <p>Therefore, the brain was more tempting to her than flesh.</p> <p>Not only did Lin Qiao inhale deeply and felt that her mind had turned a bit slow because of the aroma, even Xie Dong, who was standing behind her, couldn’t help but turn around to give a few deep sniffs.</p> <p>Lin Qiao immediately realized what was happening. In that instant, she reached out a hand and pushed Xie Dong away, then held her breath. Even though she didn’t know if she still had breath or not, she managed to hold it anyway.</p> <p>After quickly digging out the crystal nucleus, Lin Qiao spent a moment in sensing the level-five zombie outside. It seemed to be planning to leave as she saw it leaping out of the window.</p> <p>After the zombie left, Lin Qiao immediately grabbed the space-powered man’s corpse and then swiftly flashed out to throw it.</p> <p>Xie Dong saw nothing more than Lin Qiao shaking her body swiftly. The moment she shimmied, the corpse in her hands disappeared from where it was.</p> <p>In his eyes, Lin Qiao didn’t seem to have gone out. Only she herself knew that she had already gone out for once. Her moves were continuous and way too fast; so, in Xie Dong’s eyes, she had merely shaken her body.</p> <p>The two level-three zombies outside hadn’t left yet, but they caught only a hint of Lin Qiao’s vibe without seeing even a trace of her when they saw a corpse being thrown out of thin air.</p> <p>In the eyes of zombies, corpses equaled food. Having their eyes on the corpse, these zombies pounced on it immediately.</p> <p>As for Lin Qiao, she didn’t even unveil herself outside before going straight back into her space.</p> <p>After throwing out the corpse, she and Xie Dong finally sighed with relief. They couldn’t help but inhale the tempting, refreshing aroma for one last time, then it quickly dissipated in her space.</p> <p>Without being distracted by the aroma, Lin Qiao now settled her mind to study the crystal nucleus in her hand. She dared not to pinch it with her nails, but just put it in her palm, as she was afraid that it might melt down suddenly like the last couple of times.</p> <p>However, the crystal nucleus immediately emitted a wave of heat once it was put in her palm. Next, it directly turned into a stream of energy like the level-three zombie nucleus that she had absorbed the last time!</p>",
  "Chapter 45: The Change of Space": "<p>A wave of warmth flew into Lin Qiao’s body from her palm, then got concentrated in her brain. She didn’t know how to explain this to Xie Dong.</p> <p>It seemed that she had made this crystal nucleus, which belonged to him, disappear.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Xie Dong; although the nucleus was dug out by her, she didn’t think of it as hers. This whole time, she believed that it should belong to the latter.</p> <p>She was just curious, and wanted to figure out why she was able to see into someone else’s space. She just wanted to know how on earth did that happen; but now, the space-powered man was dead because of what she had done, and the crystal nucleus was absorbed by her.</p> <p>So now came the question, where was the space?</p> <p>She once again looked at Xie Dong awkwardly, and saw him still sniffing the air with his eyes closed and head raised. Clearly, he hadn’t yet come back to himself from that refreshing aroma of the brain.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao prepared to tell him that she had absorbed the space-power man’s nucleus, she suddenly felt something. The feeling climbed up to her forehead, and after that, she sensed something in her forehead that wasn’t there before.</p> <p>She suddenly turned her eyes to look in another direction.</p> <p>That area was occupied by a white fog; but all of a sudden, the edge of the white fog moved like a roller blind, slowly rolling up and showing a door-like entrance.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up and dragged over Xie Dong, who had just woken up from the aroma, then walked toward the entrance.</p> <p>Being dragged by Lin Qiao suddenly, Xie Dong’s mind was cleared as well. As he prepared to ask her about what was happening, he raised his head and saw the suddenly appeared entrance as well.</p> <p>A dark, over two meters tall, doorway appeared in the white fog, looking a little weird. But, this was Lin Qiao’s space, and there should be no danger here.</p> <p>Lin Qiao dragged Xie Dong with her because she was worried that he might lose control and rush to the other side of the lake to eat Wu Yueling while she was scouting the entrance.</p> <p>In fact, Lin Qiao’s space wasn’t huge in size. It seemed to be composed of two parts: the lake and the grassland. At a glance, she knew that the land area of her space was around one-thousand meters squared, and the surface of the lake accounted for sixty percent.</p> <p>The rest of her space was blocked by a white fog.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, Lin Qiao hadn’t discovered that her space was even smaller back when she entered it the first time. She had yet to find out that her space had already expanded quite a lot, or, the fog had dissipated partially.</p> <p>Therefore, this suddenly appearing entrance really made her feel weird.</p> <p>Dragging Xie Dong, Lin Qiao walked to the edge of her space. Standing before that new entrance, she looked inside and was dumbfounded again.</p> <p>Wasn’t it the space of that space-powered man? How could it be inside her space?</p> <p>She paused with surprise, then turned around and looked at Xie Dong confusedly.</p> <p>Xie Dong stared at her expressionlessly without knowing her meaning. He saw this space too and was also feeling surprised. However, he didn’t know that it was the space-powered man’s space, and just thought it as a part of Lin Qiao’s.</p> <p>What he had been wondering was, why didn’t this strange entrance appear earlier on, but suddenly appeared just now?</p> <p>It was now that he noticed Lin Qiao also having a bewildered look on her face. Unfortunately, her face was way too ugly, and her expression was a little twisted. So, Xie Dong failed to understand her meaning.</p> <p>Seeing his face while reading his mind, Lin Qiao learned that he still didn’t know what had happened. Hence, she wrote down a sentence on the paper and showed him.</p> <p><em>‘This is the space-powered man’s space.’ </em></p> <p>Xie Dong quickly read the note, then the expression on his face paused shortly. Next, he widened his eyes and turned his head to look at Lin Qiao with shock, who nodded back in confirmation.</p> <p>And now, he was dumbfounded as well. Was Lin Qiao capable of this? Had she just turned someone else’s space into hers?</p> <p>Lin Qiao waved at him, then both of them set foot in the entrance.</p> <p>On entering, they found that this space was rather small. It couldn’t be compared with Lin Qiao’s space, as it was only as big as a seventy or eighty meters squared room. However, it contained oxygen, which was why living human beings could stay here safely.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the pile of things in a corner.</p> <p>Apart from some clothes and weapons, some sundries and tools were also stored here. As for food and drink, Lin Qiao found a few packets of biscuits and instant noodles, and a boxful of mineral water. A couple of bottles had already been taken from the box.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over, picked up those biscuits, and checked the expiration date. As expected, those were all expired already. However, even expired food was precious in this post-apocalyptic era. People weren’t as picky about food these days as they used to be. How dare they? After all, they would have nothing to eat at all if they got picky!</p> <p>Water was precious as well, because almost all water sources in the mainland had been contaminated.</p> <p>For this reason, the domestic water in the bases was mostly created by people with ice-power and water power.</p> <p>This space-powered man didn’t seem to be capable, because even as a space power holder, he didn’t manage to build a rich collection. The most precious thing he had was a few tankfuls of gas. Lin Qiao couldn’t tell if he brought the gas in by himself or some other people asked him to do it.</p> <p>Perhaps, these few tankfuls of gas was the reason he survived till he was killed by Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Earlier on downstairs, Lin Qiao had seen the car which was parked beside the building. She knew that the car belonged to Xie Dong, as he had told her so with hand gestures at that time.</p> <p>It was a military off-road car, driven over and parked here by Huang Xiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rummaged in the pile of sundries to try and find a map or something like that. Surprisingly, she did find a map. She took it out and gave it a close look, finding that it was a map of Sea City.</p> <p>She and Xie Dong were now located in HP District. To head South and enter Ze Province, they needed to go through Xuhui District, Mingxing District, and JS District.</p> <p>Anyhow, with this map, she at least knew how to get to her hometown.</p> <p>She then found a notebook in the size of A4 paper from those sundries. Writing on it was much more comfortable than writing on Xie Dong’s palm-size notepad.</p> <p>She then directly sat down, crossed her legs, and waved at Xie Dong. She planned to have a good talk with him about his future plans.</p> <p>She planned to go South to find her family, so she needed Xie Dong’s car and the few tankfuls of gas here. But, she didn’t know if he was willing to give these to her. They had talked about this earlier, but back at that time, he had only informed her that he had a car without promising to give it to her.</p> <p>By now, the people he wanted to kill were dead, and his car had been found. Although the level-five zombie could still be nearby, Lin Qiao should be able to figure out a way to leave this place if she wanted to. Therefore, she was now going to ask Xie Dong about his plan.</p> <p>Xie Dong sat down casually and looked at Lin Qiao. In fact, he was more curious about his zombie level at this point. Was he a level-three zombie? He assumed so, because he had intelligence and memories.</p> <p>However, he didn’t seem to be as agile and nimble as level-three zombies. He felt that he was only a little nimbler than ordinary zombies.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took out the pen and started writing on a paper— <em>‘The people you wanted to kill have died. Where do you plan to go next? Wherever you’re going, I want to borrow your car and the gas here.’</em></p> <p>Reading these words, Xie Dong paused, his face filled with confusion.</p>",
  "Chapter 46: Come With Me": "<p>Xie Dong knew that Lin Qiao was going toward the southern bases. Only two bases were built in the South, the Earth Dragon Base and Hades Base.</p> <p>The Earth Dragon Base was built by the survivors from Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, while the Hades Base was built by the survivors from Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hainan Provinces.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know which base her families were in, but at the moment, she was going south anyway.</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t have a family. The only one who was relatively close to him was a woman, but she couldn’t be counted as his lover. He couldn’t go back like this, and he was even more unlikely to meet that woman. Even if she saw him, she might never want to get close to him again anyway.</p> <p>The base wouldn’t have him back either. Even if he returned, the people in the base might find out that he had become a zombie even though he now looked just like a normal human being. At that time, they would kill him straight away. After all, the base had devices running for detecting the zombie virus. So, once he approached, all alarms in the base would go off.</p> <p>However, he didn’t know what should he do out here. He no longer needed to form a team with others to hunt zombies for food and for survival, because he just didn’t need human food anymore.</p> <p>He had no friends to protect and no families who relied on him. Suddenly, he didn’t know what to do next.</p> <p>Looking at his confused face, Lin Qiao understood that he didn’t know where to go. Abruptly, she wrote down on the paper— <em>‘Or, you can go South with me.’</em></p> <p>She felt quite lonely and bored when she was alone. Although she had a little one in her space, she wouldn’t say no to another companion.</p> <p>Reading the note that she handed over, Xie Dong paused slightly, then his eyes twinkled.</p> <p>She was right! He had no idea how to survive like this. Looking at this strange female zombie in front of him, Xie Dong felt it was better to stay with her for the time being, as he had no place to go at the moment anyway.</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t need to nod, because Lin Qiao had already received his thought. She raised her head to glance at this space, then wrote a few words on the paper.</p> <p><em>‘We can’t go out for now. You stay in this space.’</em></p> <p>She meant that this place could serve as his room. Lin Qiao wanted him to stay here because she was worried that he might drool over Wu Yueling if he went out, and might someday fail to restrain himself and pounce upon her.</p> <p>Xie Dong nodded. He didn’t care where Lin Qiao let him stay. But, thinking of Wu Yueling, he still felt curious about why this female zombie stole someone’s daughter. However, as she had shown no intentions to hurt the kid, he stopped worrying so much.</p> <p>Besides, that little princess seemed to have a not-so-bad relationship with this female zombie.</p> <p>He recalled that earlier on, Wu Yueling had tried to protect Lin Qiao and stop him from shooting. That made him feel a little surprised.</p> <p>All people in the Sea City Base knew that the little princess wouldn’t get close to anyone. It was not because she was too proud, but because she had autism. She was a solitary kid, and she never wanted to be close with people. No matter how familiar a person was to her, she wouldn’t talk to him or her. In the entire base, she would only communicate with her father and a superpowered woman.</p> <p>But now, he had seen that this solitary little princess was actually willing to get close to a… female zombie, who was ugly and had been behaving weirdly!</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at Lin Qiao with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao threw a glance back at him.</p> <p>Xie Dong rubbed his nose as he knew that she heard him calling her ugly just now.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up and walked out with some biscuits, the notebook, map, pen, and a bottle of water.</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t follow her out, but stayed in the small space.</p> <p>After coming out, Lin Qiao spent a moment in sensing the situation out of her space. She found that the two level-three zombies had disappeared, leaving nothing but a few chewed corpses in the room. However, she could still sense the zombie leader’s vibe near this area.</p> <p>The zombie leader was still waiting, and didn’t seem to want to leave.</p> <p>Since it was waiting outside, Lin Qiao decided just to let it wait. Nothing would happen as long as she didn’t go out.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At this moment, in an office in the administration building of Sea City Base, a handsome young man in his early twenties was looking down, reading some documents. He was wearing a slim cut white shirt, with a thin black blazer draped over his shoulders. He looked clean and tidy, with a calm personality, seeming like a top tiered person.</p> <p>Suddenly, someone knocked on the door of his office.</p> <p>“Come in.” This handsome man responded without raising his head.</p> <p>The door was immediately pushed open, and another young man in a white shirt stood by the door. His shirt was clean, but was hanging loosely instead of being tucked in. The three buttons in his chest area were unbuttoned, revealing his collarbones and a half of his chest.</p> <p>This man had a unisex face, which was strangely beautiful, but not feminine.</p> <p>He kept one hand in his trouser pocket while holding a sheet of paper with the other. Lazily leaning against the door frame, he began talking, “Tianyi, I have news here. It’s about your evil sister. I wonder if you’re interested.”</p> <p>Hearing him, the man who had been reading documents in the office raised his head while knitting his long and slim brows. His face was filled with disgust and impatience as he looked at the man at the door.</p> <p>“I have nothing to do with her since a long time ago. How many times have I told you to not mention her to me? Can’t you see that I’m in the middle of something?” He responded discontentedly.</p> <p>The man at the door slightly raised his hands to make a pose of surrender, but meanwhile, he continued talking with a careless look, “Alright, alright, alright! I get it… But, are you sure that you don’t want to hear this? Since you’re not interested, I’ll leave with this letter. But, I’m telling you that you might regret if you never get to know about this.”</p> <p>Although he had talked about leaving, this man continued to lean against the doorframe instead of moving. He didn’t seem like he wanted to leave at all.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi continued reading the documents in his hands. Three seconds later, he threw the documents on the desk and then raised his head, asking impatiently and helplessly, “Say it… What has she done this time?”</p> <p>Since the news was delivered by this man himself, Lu Tianyi assumed that the woman must have done something serious and bad again. Otherwise, he could have let someone else bring the message.</p> <p>This man delivered the message himself also because he didn’t want other people to know its contents.</p> <p>Hearing Lu Tianyi, this man named Kong Qingming stood straight and walked in with the letter. After closing and locking the door, he walked up to Lu Tianyi’s desk.</p> <p>He put the letter on the desk and pushed it toward Lu Tianyi, then said, “She has indeed done something, but that’s not what I’m gonna say. What I’m going to tell you is… She’s dead.”</p> <p>The expression on Lu Tianyi’s face paused briefly. Even though he still looked quite calm, Kong Qingming noticed his pupils shrinking slightly.</p> <p>Kong Qingming took a small step backward and then put both of his hands in his trouser pockets. He stood still, looking at Lu Tianyi while showing an idle manner with his whole body.</p> <p>After pausing for a moment, Lu Tianyi picked up the letter with a frown while asking, “What happened? How could she die suddenly? Wasn’t she with Lin Yong and the other few?”</p>",
  "Chapter 47: She’s Dead, No Big Deal": "<p>In the base, everyone knew that Lu Tianyu was one of Yang Chao’s women, so no one dared to offend her. People would try to avoid her when they saw her, and even if they couldn’t, they wouldn’t get close to her. When Lu Tianyu went out of the base, Yang Chao would always send three superpowered people with her to keep her safe.</p> <p>He wouldn’t let her die so easily.</p> <p>Kong Qingming shrugged and said, “I don’t know what happened. I only know that she’s dead, and she kidnapped Wu Chengyue’s little princess before she died. That girl is still missing. That woman, I think… Something happened to her.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi raised his head to look at Kong Qingming, and asked with a calm look, “What do you mean?”</p> <p>He knew that no matter how bold and reckless that woman was, she wouldn’t dare to do anything to Wu Chengyue’s daughter.</p> <p>Kong Qingming said, “There’s another thing that I’ve just found out. Having kidnapped Wu Chengyue’s daughter before she died, she threatened him with his daughter. As everyone knows, she had been coveting him for long. So this time, she finally got him, but died not long after that because Lin Yong and the other two threw her into a crowd of zombie.”</p> <p>“But, she didn’t bring the little prince back before she died, and Lin Yong and the other two have failed to find her. As far as I know, it seems that Yang Chao has told Lin Yong and the other two to do something. As for the truth, that depends on whether you want to find it out or not.” He looked at Lu Tianyi’s unchanging face and continued.</p> <p>What Kong Qingming meant was, if Lu Tianyi wanted to figure out what exactly had happened, he would help him.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi waved a hand to him and shook his head while saying “Forget it! She’s dead, no big deal. She died, but it’s none of my business. She and I have nothing to do with each other anymore.”</p> <p>While speaking, he put the letter in his palm, with a breeze rising and wrapping around the letter to form a tiny tornado Being wrapped in the tiny tornado, the letter was immediately shredded into scraps of paper and drifting ashes.</p> <p>Next, the tiny tornado rose from his palm and flew out of the window aside, dissipating along with those paper scraps.</p> <p>Hearing him, Kong Qingming nodded and said, “Alright, it’s up to you. I’ll leave then.”</p> <p>While speaking, he turned and walked to the door, then opened it and left.</p> <p>After watching him shut the door, Lu Tianyi began to let his emotion surge slowly in his eyes.</p> <p>He was shocked. He found his sister’s death kind of unacceptable, also feeling hatred and some other complicated emotions.</p> <p>That woman never saw him as her brother or family, because they weren’t given birth by the same mother, and were just half-siblings. They never liked each other since they were little; they would wrangle and laugh at each other every time they met. Behind his back, she had framed and humiliated him in all kinds of ways; he had been enduring all this because she was his sister and he couldn’t do anything to her.</p> <p>That woman did not care about him, neither did she ever try to find him after the apocalyptic era began. Instead, she ignored him and ran away with someone powerful.</p> <p>Back then, he was having a serious fever. If Kong Qingming hadn’t made it to him in time, he might have been eaten by zombies before his superpower was activated.</p> <p>Since then, Lu Tianyi’s dislike of his sister had turned into hatred. However, deep down, he still had a trace of expectation, as he hoped that she could treat him like a family. After all, she was the only family he had left, the rest having died after the apocalyptic era began.</p> <p>Later on, the two of them met each other in the base, yet she pretended not to know him. Relying on that man, she had done all manners of evils, and had ridden roughshod over all the others in the base.</p> <p>In fact, no one in the base knew about his relationship with Lu Tianyu except Kong Qingming.</p> <p>Every time he saw her bully, rob, and insult the others, he would remain silent and turn a blind eye, only minding his own business. Anyway, she never talked to him either.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi knew that he had a conflicting attitude. He detested her, even hated her, but he could never ignore any news about her. He watched her bully the others, yet she never looked him in the eye; he wanted to get close to her, but couldn’t live with what she did. However, even though he couldn’t accept her behavior, he always stealthily cleaned up her mess behind her back.</p> <p>But now, she was actually dead. His only family in this post-apocalyptic world had died.</p> <p>He always knew that she would suffer the consequences one day and become the victim of her own evil deeds, but when this day really came, he couldn’t accept it fully.</p> <p>He had been silently dealing with the aftermath of what she had done because he didn’t want her to be taken revenge against by others. He saw that Yang Chao did dote on her, letting her do whatever she wanted as he fixed all her problems. So, he felt that she would at least be safe by staying around that man.</p> <p>But, since she cast her eyes on another leader of the base, Lu Tianyi began worrying about her. That was the reason why he asked Kong Qingming to keep an eye on her moves.</p> <p>However, she died anyway, and she died in the hands of the man she trusted.</p> <p>Earlier on, Kong Qingming had indeed mentioned to him that Yang Chao had lost his interest in his sister.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi stood up behind his desk and walked to the window. As he raised his head to look at the dark sky of this post-apocalyptic world, he suddenly felt an emptiness in his heart.</p> <p>After looking at the sky for a while, he abruptly turned around and put on the blazer which was draped around his shoulders, then walked toward the door. Once he opened the door, he saw a man leaning against the wall by the door, eyes closed and head lowered, seeming to be drowsy.</p> <p>Lu Tianyu paused briefly, then said with a bland tone, “Didn’t you say that you’ll leave?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming opened his eyes and looked at Lu Tianyi absently. After pausing for a second, he seemed to understand Lu Tianyi’s meaning finally, then responded, “I said I’m out, not that I’m leaving.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi sighed, but said no more as he turned and walked toward the outside.</p> <p>Kong Qingming caught up and asked, “If you’re going out of the base, why don’t you ask me to go with you? I haven’t been out for a long time.”</p> <p>While speaking, he raised a hand and patted his yawning mouth.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi didn’t say anything, just walking down the stairs without pausing.</p> <p>They weren’t inseparable, but they would always go out of the base together. No matter which one of them wanted to go, the other would follow.</p> <p>In the base, some other people thought that they were a couple. The others could accept them being together as both of them were good-looking, even though neither of them had an interest in men.</p> <p>In this post-apocalyptic world, pretty men with white skin and slim body shapes were quite popular, as the number of women had decreased sharply. For this reason, some people called the post-apocalyptic era ‘an era of being gay’!</p> <p>Sadly, these two men who seemed to be suitable for being gay in the others’ eyes, only liked women’s bodies, and had absolutely no interest in men!</p> <p>A lot of men had their eyes on them, but none of those was stronger than them. Otherwise, male rape, as one of the most common events in the post-apocalyptic era, would have happened to them as well.</p> <p>Similar incidents did happen, but the results… weren’t the same as some people had expected.</p> <p>In the end, those men were either cut into skeletons by Lu Tianyi or thrown out of the base with broken limbs to feed zombies by Kong Qingming.</p>",
  "Chapter 48: The Zombie Which Is Afraid of Stink": "<p>On the other side, Lin Qiao stayed in her space with Xie Dong and the little one for a couple of days before she finally let him and herself out while Wu Yueling stayed inside.</p> <p>The little girl had already gotten used to staying in her space, and was less afraid by now. She could even chase the rabbit all over, even though she still wouldn’t talk too much.</p> <p>Maybe because of Lin Qiao’s space or the lake water, Wu Yueling didn’t feel much of hunger. Even if she did feel hungry, the hunger wouldn’t cause her body functions to decline.</p> <p>As for Lin Qiao herself, it seemed that as long as she continued to stay in her space, her sense of hunger would be less strong. Basically, even Wu Yueling’s smell couldn’t bother her in there. Unlike her, Xie Dong still seemed to be unable to control himself, because as soon as he smelled Wu Yueling, he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from staring straight at her and slowly losing his sanity.</p> <p>For this reason, Lin Qiao told Xie Dong not to come out of the small space unless he had to. After all, he would look really like a pervert if he kept staring at a five-year-old girl and drooling.</p> <p>Xie Dong told Lin Qiao that she would be hunted by Wu Yueling’s father for taking the little princess away. In response, Lin Qiao told him that Wu Chengyue could try to find her if he had the ability! She had a space, so who would she be afraid of? No matter how powerful that man was, he couldn’t possibly enter her space, could he?</p> <p>Xie Dong was curious why she took away the child; but every time he asked her this question, she would bare her teeth to him without giving him an answer. Even though her reaction made him even more curious, he wouldn’t ask it again.</p> <p>After staying in her space for a couple of Days, Lin Qiao felt that the level-five zombie wouldn’t show up again, so she went outside with Xie Dong.</p> <p>The room was suffused with an awful stench. The corpses which had their brains eaten wouldn’t become zombies even if they were affected by the virus, because only the corpses with more than fifty percent of their brains remaining unharmed would turn into zombies.</p> <p>The corpses which didn’t turn into zombies would rot quickly because of the high temperature during the daytime. The night temperature was low, but wouldn’t slow down the decay process.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s sense of smell was as sharp as that of dogs. Therefore, she was nearly knocked out by the stink in the room once she came out.</p> <p>She had no idea how Lu Tianyu’s brain remained untouched when she died. If her brain was eaten too, Lin Qiao wouldn’t have woken up in her body as a zombie even if her soul managed to enter this body, would she?</p> <p>What Lin Qiao didn’t know was that her soul had entered this body back then, right after Lu Tianyu died and before her brain was eaten. Her soul stayed in Lu Tianyu’s brain and guarded it with a spurt of energy, because of which, those zombies merely bit Lu Tianyu’s face but didn’t touch her brain.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao had directly become a high-level zombie when she woke up.</p> <p>But of course, Lin Qiao knew none of that; nobody did. If anyone knew about what had happened back then, they would have been utterly confused, without knowing how to explain that.</p> <p>The stink in the room made Lin Qiao cover her nose and jump out of the window in a flurry. Xie Dong suffered less than she had. He was only sensitive to the smell of human beings, but could sense absolutely no other odors.</p> <p>He looked at Lin Qiao, who was sitting on top of his car, and felt like laughing. It seemed that having a sharp sense of smell wasn’t always a good thing.</p> <p><em>‘But anyhow, you’re a zombie, aren’t you? Yet you’re actually afraid of the smell of rotting corpses? Which zombie can be afraid of this smell?’ </em>Xie Dong thought.</p> <p>With the map, Lin Qiao didn’t need to go into the city anymore. Instead, the two directly drove toward the South.</p> <p>A couple of hours after they left, another military off-road car showed up under the building they were in earlier. A man and a woman got off the car and walked straight into the building without paying any attention to the zombies in the surrounding area.</p> <p>The surrounding zombies intended to approach the two, but had no way to do that as they would be hit by lightning once they tried!</p> <p>The man wearing camouflage clothes had no expression on his face, but a hint of somberness in his eyes. He blankly looked at the woman in front of him, asked, “Are they really here?”</p> <p>While speaking, he quickly waved a hand. A few thin lightning bolts descended from the sky and struck on the heads of the couple of zombies which had been slowly shambling toward the woman and himself. The man didn’t even need to take a glance at those zombies.</p> <p>Along with a series of thuds, the few zombies shivered immediately and then fell to the ground. The attack made the stop moving, their bodies emitting smoke.</p> <p>Meng Yue closed her eyes to feel carefully. She looked upward and said uncertainly, “The sense is faint, and I’m not so sure. However, a little clue is better than our pointless searching.”</p> <p>While speaking, she walked upstairs ahead of that man.</p> <p>The two of them searched through every floor on their way up, but found nothing until they walked into that room with a few rotting corpses. In that room, they finally had some discovery.</p> <p>Both of them were struck by the stink in the room, needing to cover their noses when walking in.</p> <p>In this place, Meng Yue stopped being able to feel Wu Yueling. The two of them observed the four corpses in the room and found that all of them were bitten by zombies.</p> <p>“The vibes of these people… seem to be a little familiar. Have we met them before?” Meng Yue covered her nose and scanned the few corpses with her calm eyes as she asked with confusion.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue spent a moment feeling with focus, then took a close look at the few corpses’ faces. Afterward, he shook his head and said, “They’ve been dead for days, and their vibes have dissipated. My senses aren’t as sharp as yours, so I can’t recognize them.”</p> <p>Meng Yue looked at the few corpses, failing to recognize them as well. After that, she turned around and walked out of the room to breathe some fresh air.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue followed her out and asked, “Are you sure that Ling Ling’s vibe was detected from this room? Could it be wrong?”</p> <p>Meng Yue unhappily glanced at him and responded, “Why did you follow me here if you don’t believe me? Go find her yourself!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue immediately gave her a fawning smile. The smile on his handsome face could make people feel warm and gentle, like touching a clean and soft stream of water. “No! It’s not that I don’t believe you. I’m just worrying that what if you’re really wrong? I know you’re worrying about Ling Ling as much as I am!</p> <p>Meng Yue was slightly shocked by his smile. Facing this handsome man’s smile, she could no longer remain calm, but still snorted coldly and said, “Em… See, even you doubted me. Have I ever been wrong? Why don’t you think about that? I know you’re too concerned about Ling Ling to even think straight, but you know that I am worried about her as well. How could I lead you around aimlessly?”</p> <p>While speaking, she turned her face and walked downstairs.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned back and glanced at the few unrecognizable corpses in the room, then followed her down.</p> <p>“If you believe that Ling Ling has been here, then she must have been brought here by that female zombie. But, who ate those few people in there? Did that female zombie eat them? Then, why didn’t she eat Ling Ling?”</p> <p>Meng Yue shook her head and said, “Not necessarily. The smell in that room is too strong, but I sensed that more than one zombie had been there. It should be other zombies which ate those people. Didn’t Yunlong say that the female zombie has no hostility? It really hasn’t eaten human beings. I agree with him on this point. So, don’t scare yourself. Ling Ling is fine.”</p>",
  "Chapter 49: Where Did this Alien Come From?": "<p>While talking, the two of them walked quickly down the stairs, where Meng Yue stood in front of the building and again closed her eyes to sense.</p> <p>Suddenly, she opened her eyes as a faint joyful look flashed across them. She raised her right hand with palm facing upward. Next, a glowing green little grass sprouted from her palm.</p> <p>Both of them immediately fixed their eyes on the grass. The grass hadn’t grown tall, just about two centimeters in height. It swayed in Meng Yue’s palm, swinging left then right.</p> <p>Catching their scents, the surrounding zombies instantly turned back and stumbled toward them again. At a short distance, three figures had been running swiftly on all fours in the direction where Lin Qiao was moving to.</p> <p>Those were the level-five zombie and its two underlings. To chase after Lin Qiao or to avoid being targeted by Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue, the three of them were running incredibly fast.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue quickly glanced at the direction where they were moving to, then stopped paying attention to them as he kept staring at the little grass in Meng Yue’s palm. Meanwhile, a hand of his never stopped swinging left and right from time to time.</p> <p>Thin purple lightning bolts flashed from the sky, clearing out all the zombies that had been approaching the two of them. The lightning bolts surrounded them in a circle and gathered into a giant beam of light that covered them.</p> <p>Both of them concentratedly gazed at the grass, which slowly became still after swaying for a while. One of its two blades bent down while the other one rose slantingly, pointing in a direction like a pointer.</p> <p>Then, the two of them found out that the direction which the grass was pointing at was exactly where the level-five zombie went to, which Wu Chengyue had sensed just now.</p> <p>“That way.” Said Meng Yue with certainty.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue slightly frowned and asked, “Are you sure? A few high-level zombies went that way just now.”</p> <p>Meng Yue paused briefly and then turned around to look at him as she asked, “How many? High-level zombies? Was the female zombie one of them?”</p> <p>She had concentrated on the grass just now, so her sensation toward the surrounding environment had weakened by seventy percent. Therefore, she hadn’t noticed anything suspicious around her.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue shook his head and said, “I didn’t sense her vibe. But, those few zombies seem to be chasing after something. They were running really fast.”</p> <p>“Chase after what? Can it be that female zombie?” asked Meng Yue.</p> <p>People had to admit that women had sharp intuition sometimes, especially those like Meng Yue who had a special superpower.</p> <p>Hearing her, Wu Chengyue felt it to be a real possibility. Earlier on, he didn’t think of it because he hadn’t found out that Ling Ling was also moving in this direction. But now, as these two factors were linked together, this possibility turned to be high.</p> <p>With this thought, he couldn’t stay still anymore. He turned back and dimmed the surrounding lightning bolts, then walked toward the dark-green off-road car that he drove over. Meanwhile, he waved a hand and swept across the zombies that had been trying to climb up his car with a few lightning bolts, which were slightly thicker than those he used for his own protection earlier.</p> <p>Following a series of thunderclaps, the zombies which had gathered around or on top of his car were immediately struck into piles of dark ash.</p> <p>When the two of them quickly walked to the car door, it opened up for them.</p> <p>“Chief…” A soldier sitting in the driver’s seat turned his head and greeted them.<br/>\nWu Chengyue nodded, then bent down and sat into the car. He pointed at the direction that the grass blade pointed out just now and said, “Go that way… Drive fast! ”</p> <p>Meng Yue got into the back seat of the car. The little grass in her palm had already disappeared.</p> <p>“Understood!” The soldier immediately nodded and pressed the accelerator while neatly turning the steering wheel. With that, the car backed quickly, then steadily turned around and rushed onto the road.</p> <p>Lin Qiao, who was sitting in the back seat of another car, hadn’t yet known that two groups of pursuers were coming after her. And, she wasn’t a match for either of those groups.</p> <p>She was studying the map, trying to find out which way to go while Xie Dong was driving. However, after she spent quite a while reading the map, he told her that she didn’t need to study about the roads in this area, because as long as they drove on the highway, he would know where to go.</p> <p>Xie Dong was more familiar with this area than Lin Qiao. Therefore, he didn’t need her to show him the way for the time being. He already knew the road from which he could access the highway that led toward Zhe Province.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glared at him with dissatisfaction. Why didn’t he tell her earlier on that he knew the way, but let her read the map alone pointlessly? She wasn’t familiar with this area, so she wanted to figure out the route.</p> <p>To find out if the car could take her space along while she was in, Lin Qiao entered her space from within the car, leaving Xie Dong driving alone.<br/>\nAs a result, she wasn’t in the car anymore when she came back out, remaining at the exact spot where she had entered the space from; the car was already a hundred meters away. As the experiment had failed, Lin Qiao had no choice but to sit in the car bored.</p> <p>She was going to water the strawberry plants in her space which she had randomly planted and had actually survived. After a few days of observation, she found that the putrid smell of those strawberries had been slowly weakening, maybe because of the soil or because she had watered them with the lake water. Anyway, the area with strawberry plants was no longer as smelly as it used to be.</p> <p>Before, Lin Qiao thought that the strawberries she transplanted to her space would have a low survival rate. But unexpectedly, all of them survived; not a single plant died. Therefore, during the past few days when she stayed in her space with nothing more to do, she cleared the strawberry field of weeds with her claws, and picked the ripe strawberries, washing them up and serving to Wu Yueling in a bowl.</p> <p>She remembered the utterly confused expression which was shown on Xie Dong’s face when he saw the cluttered strawberry field of hers. She didn’t even know what that expression was supposed to mean.</p> <p><em>‘What kind of strawberries are these? They don’t even look normal? They’re mutant and poisonous, aren’t they? She’s a zombie, but why is she planting strawberries? Do zombies eat strawberries?’ </em>This was what Xie Dong was thinking back then.</p> <p>He even had walked over and picked a strawberry. As a normal zombie, he wasn’t able to smell anything but human beings. Therefore, he couldn’t detect the suffocating odor of the strawberry. He took a bite, but as he tasted no flavor, it felt like biting wax. Hence, he disliked this strawberry field very much deep down.</p> <p>Consequently, his confusion about the reason why Lin Qiao planted strawberries deepened. But, when he saw her wash them and then put them in a bowl for Wu Yueling, he understood why.</p> <p>There was a rabbit in Lin Qiao’s space, and Xie Dong had seen it as well. However, he had absolutely no interest in it. Therefore, when she asked him if he had smelled the aroma of the rabbit, he looked at her confusedly.</p> <p>Everyone in this post-apocalyptic world knew that zombies ate no other living things except human beings.</p> <p>At last, Lin Qiao told him that she are rabbits and mice, and that those animals tasted not that bad. Hearing that, he stared at her with his eyes again filled with puzzlement.</p> <p><em>‘What kind of a zombie is she? Where did this alien come from?’ </em>He wondered.</p> <p>She had memories and an exceptionally sharp sense of smell; she could control herself from eating human beings; grew strawberries; and had such a large, precious space. If these were still acceptable, she was also able to absorb the spaces of others and turn them into hers, which was a little terrifying indeed.</p> <p>What was even scarier, not only did she have memories, but also human-level intelligence!</p>",
  "Chapter 50: Man-Eating Society": "<p>Xie Dong’s off-road car was running on the highway, passing many abandoned vehicles that lay along the highway. Before, many roads and highways were jammed by abandoned vehicles; but as people often drove out of bases to hunt zombies during these years, some paths were slowly cleared in the areas where they had been.</p> <p>People all panicked when the apocalyptic era began. No one remembered any traffic rules, and everyone wanted to drive and leave. As more and more cars squeezed into the roads and highways, one could imagine the result. Car accidents happened one after another, and every accident was a pileup. The corpses of the people who didn’t manage to run were still lying in their cars, while the ones who survived had abandoned their vehicles.</p> <p>Therefore, since the post-apocalyptic era started, many places started looking the same. Only after the bases of survivors were built up did people slowly realize what had happened, and gradually found a way to keep living amidst zombie crowds.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Xie Dong kept driving southward day and night. When the car ran out of gas, they would take out the gas from her space to refuel. When they encountered zombie-hunting squads, they normally would avoid them; but if they couldn’t, Xie Dong would have no choice but to deal with those people alone.</p> <p>Like now…</p> <p>“You alone? Where’re your teammates?” A group of burly guys barred the road, standing in front of Xie Dong’s car.</p> <p>Xie Dong stopped the car and sat still in the driver’s seat. With his eyes, he quietly measured the seven men who had surrounded his car.</p> <p>These people fiercely blocked his way once they showed up. All seven of them were wearing thick bullet-proof jackets and black combat uniforms, holding rifles in their hands. More guns were worn on their waists, backs, and legs. These people were armed to the teeth. As soon as Xie Dong stopped the car, they rushed up and surrounded it.</p> <p>All seven of them showed a really surprised look in their eyes when they found that Xie Dong was in the car alone. They greedily scanned across his car over and over again, but after finding nothing good in there, began talking to him in a cold and rude tone.</p> <p>At the sight of these people’s looks and gears, Xie Dong knew that he had encountered with the post-apocalyptic world version of robbers.</p> <p>There were one kind of people who were capable of fighting but weren’t willing to make the efforts and guard their bases, nor come out to hunt zombies and trade their harvests for food. They only liked to stay in the bases and sneakily rob the others, or steal and gain things by cheating. They were a bunch of rascals and rogues.</p> <p>Over time, these people were reported by the others and kicked out by the administrators of their bases. They lived a vagabond life out here, holding a grudge against the people in the bases. Therefore, they would often attack zombie-hunting squads, committing robberies and murders. No one was restraining them out here, which made them even more savage.</p> <p>Most people who encountered them or were targeted by them wouldn’t be able to make it back to their bases alive.</p> <p>Judging by these people’s behavior and the look in their eyes, Xie Dong knew who they were. He remained sitting still without answering their question.</p> <p>A man thumped at the car window by Xie Dong’s side and yelled at him fiercely, “You, get out!”</p> <p>Xie Dong knew that if he got out of the car, these people would tip the car over. After all, these people weren’t ordinary, all having superpowers.</p> <p>He silently opened the car door and got off.</p> <p>All these men had impressive appearances. Some of them were tall, some were short; some were fat, and some were slim. Seeing Xie Dong get off the car, they immediately jumped in and searched every corner, but failed to find any food.</p> <p>“Damn it, this kid got nothing in his car.” A fierce-looking, tall and muscular man impatiently rummaged through the car and found nothing, then cursed in anger at once.</p> <p>Hearing him, the others started showing sulky expressions as well.</p> <p>They had been searching in this area for nearly a month, and this was the first car they had found. These starving people rushed up at the sight of Xie Dong’s car to see if they could find some food in his car. But after forcing the car to stop, they found nothing but a man in it, and their hearts sank.</p> <p>There was only one man in the car, which meant that this man wouldn’t have much food. But, the seven robbers had been starving for days. Unexpectedly, they found nothing from the car. Not to mention food for one man, there was no food at all.</p> <p>After knowing that there was no food in the car, they immediately glared at Xie Dong and asked, “Tell us, where is the food? Did you hide it?”</p> <p>While speaking, one of the robbers approached him and attempted to search him for food.</p> <p>As he came nearby, Xie Dong took a step backward.</p> <p><em>‘Speaking of food, the only food here is your flesh,’ h </em>e really wanted to tell them that <em>. </em></p> <p>But at the moment, he couldn’t speak at all. And of course, he wouldn’t really eat human beings. Even though he had become a zombie, the humanity that he had been having for more than twenty years hadn’t disappeared, and his mind was still righteous.</p> <p>Even though the smell of these people was very tempting, and it made him want very much to pounce upon them and bite their throats, he restrained himself from doing that.</p> <p>Seeing Xie Dong stepping back, the one who was approaching him was immediately infuriated. He raised the gunstock to hit Xie Dong’s face while growling, “Damn you! Why did you move? Stand still if you don’t want to die miserably! Otherwise, we’ll slice off your flesh and eat you later.”</p> <p>Eating human flesh was no longer something new in these people’s eyes; they could be even scarier than ghosts when they were starving. How could they possibly survive out here while the world was filled with crowds of zombies if they didn’t eat other people?</p> <p>This was the reason that most of the people who had encountered them didn’t manage to survive; those people were eaten! Food was severely scarce in this apocalyptic world. Therefore, some people had become crazy in order to survive. For the first, second, or even third time, people might find that it was hard to accept things like eating other people mentally. But, after the first few times, they would slowly accept it and get used to it. After all, suffering from hunger would make people lose their minds and drive them crazy.</p> <p>This was the post-apocalyptic world.</p> <p>This man said this to frighten Xie Dong, to scare him, and make him panic. They wouldn’t let Xie Dong leave in the end either, because human flesh was also food.</p> <p>All the survivors in this apocalyptic world would rather encounter zombies when they came out of their bases than run into these man-eating human beings.</p> <p>After all, man-eating people were more horrible than unintelligent zombies!</p> <p>Watching that man swing the gunstock at his face, Xie Dong tilted his head to dodge and raised his arm to defend himself.</p> <p>Seeing that Xie Dong actually dared to defend, that man was enraged instantly. He raised a foot to kick him instead.</p> <p>Xie Dong dodged immediately. He didn’t fight this robber who was actually shorter than himself; but instead, turned around and slammed out a heavy punch at another man who was behind him.</p> <p>The man behind Xie Dong was a fat one. As the human shield, he was supposed to prevent the latter from running away. But to his surprise, Xie Dong suddenly turned around to punch his face instead of fighting the short one who had attacked him. The fat man didn’t manage to react timely; as a result, he suffered a severe blow in the nose, which immediately squeezed his tears and snot out of his face.</p> <p>“Ou-ch” The fat man screamed, then covered his nose and squatted down.</p> <p>Xie Dong knew that this would happen when he struck out this punch. Therefore, he didn’t even take back his hand before swiftly leaping over the fat man.</p>",
  "Chapter 51: The Apocalyptic World Robbers": "<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>Seeing Xie Dong make a move, the other robbers immediately raised their guns and fired at him while swearing furiously.</p> <p>“Damn you! You wanna die? Then die!”</p> <p>But next, they were dumbfounded to see him not even trying to dodge the bullets. After leaping over the fat man, he suddenly turned back. Standing behind the fat man, he completely ignored the bullets which had hit him, then directly bent down and stuck his claws into the fat man’s back.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>A beating heart was dug out in the next second.</p> <p>The fat man’s eyes bulged and his mouth was wide open. However, his screams were stuck in his throat as he fell to the side slowly before thudding against the ground.</p> <p>At this moment, Xie Dong saw only this fresh, beating heart in his hand, but had no spared attention for those robbers.</p> <p>What these hungry robbers didn’t know was that Xie Dong was even more starving than they were! Since he woke up as a zombie, he hadn’t eaten anything for days. He was a relatively lower level zombie; therefore, he had been suffering from the hunger all day. If not for Lin Qiao’s suppression and the lake water’s effect, he might have lost his mind already and become a crazy zombie which had memories.</p> <p>If that happened, he would be likely to bite every living human being he saw, and might not be able to tell the good people from the bad ones.</p> <p>Xie Dong had been struggling with himself while he was holding the heart and smelling its tempting smell. The fat man was an evil person, but still, he was a human being. If Xie Dong ate this heart, he would become a man-eating creature, wouldn’t he? But, he was really hungry now, and his empty stomach made him feel so uneasy.</p> <p>Another voice from his heart had been telling him that he was no longer a human being, that he was a zombie, and eating human beings was a normal physiological response of zombies; and that he didn’t need to care about those viewpoints based on humanity.</p> <p>Hearing that voice, Xie Dong gazed at the heart, hesitating over sinking his teeth into it.</p> <p>The six robbers who were still alive all stood stupefied when they saw Xie Dong staring straight at the human heart in his hand without glancing at them, and seeming to feel absolutely nothing when the bullets hit his body.</p> <p><em>‘This, </em>th <em>-this… What is this? Why could this man cut out someone’s heart bare-handedly? Why didn’t he respond to the bullets that hit him? Why does he seem so hungry when staring at the heart?’</em></p> <p><em>‘What on earth is going on!’</em></p> <p>To them, Xie Dong still looked like a human being, and was able to drive like a normal person. So, these robbers all thought that he was a human being. However, what he just did had gone beyond the limitations of human beings.</p> <p>Right at this moment, they saw this man suddenly put the heart into his mouth and take a large bite. The blood seeped from the corners of his mouth, and soon, his entire mouth was red with blood.</p> <p>Seeing the satisfaction in Xie Dong’s eyes, the robbers were stunned. Their brains even stopped working for a moment.</p> <p>They too ate human beings, but they would at least cook the human flesh before eating it. As for eating raw human flesh, not even these brutal evil robbers could do that.</p> <p>Therefore, these robbers were frightened when they saw Xie Dong bite the fresh heart directly. This man turned out to be even fiercer than they were!</p> <p>A man who seemed to the leader of these robbers soon realized what had happened. He calmed down and fixed his eyes on Xie Dong, then began observing him.</p> <p>He found that Xie Dong’s gunshot wounds had been bleeding, but that blood was dark-purple instead of red.</p> <p>When he saw Xie Dong eat the human heart, he thought that the latter was like himself; but now as he had calmed down, he found something unusual about Xie Dong.</p> <p>When Xie Dong stuck his claws into the fat man’s back and ripped out the heart, his moves were neat and quick like an instinctive action. He ignored the bullets that hit him, and made completely no reaction to the gunshots; his blood wasn’t red, but was dark-purple, like the blood which had pooled for a long time without flowing.</p> <p>Suddenly, a thought flashed across this robber leader’s head, causing his face to pale. He instantly drew back while shouting, “Get back! He’s a high-level zombie!”</p> <p>He fired at Xie Dong’s head while retreating. Hearing him, the others were all shocked, and then they hurriedly fell back.</p> <p>As for Xie Dong, he impatiently popped the rest of the heart into his mouth and wolfed it down after taking the first bite.</p> <p>Xie Dong seemed to be a little slow in reaction as he was eating. It seemed that he hadn’t sensed the bullets which were flying at his head. If those bullets hit him in the head, the result wouldn’t be too good.</p> <p>However, just when the bullets were about to hit him, a figure suddenly flashed out from the side to shield him. It raised its arms and swiftly clawed in the air, then some bullets fell from its hands one after another.</p> <p><em>‘Where did this zombie come from?’ </em>The robbers couldn’t figure it out.</p> <p>Lin Qiao threw the bullets in her hands to the ground, then glanced at the robbers disdainfully. Suddenly, she turned back and gave Xie Dong a kick.</p> <p>Xie Dong was immersed in the satisfaction of eating the fresh heart. But after being kicked suddenly, he turned back and looked at Lin Qiao with confusion.</p> <p>“Roar!” Lin Qiao bared her teeth to him, then curled her lips and gave him a roar. <em>‘Don’t just eat! Do you want the bullets to go through your head?’ </em>she said.</p> <p>Hearing her roar, Xie Dong finally came back to himself and realized what he had eaten. His face paled as he suddenly rushed to the side, then bent down and retched. He even put his fingers into his throat to try and make himself vomit what was eaten.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was just speechless at this point, figuratively of course, as she couldn’t speak anyway, <em>‘You’ve already eaten it, so why do you have to force yourself to throw up now?’</em></p> <p>But soon, she couldn’t pay attention to Xie Dong anymore because the robbers had already started attacking her.</p> <p>The six spread out and fired at her crazily.</p> <p>Following the flight tracks of the bullets, Lin Qiao felt that this was like playing a game. She moved swiftly and dodged a series of bullets which were flying toward her. Meanwhile, she rushed at the nearest robber.</p> <p>This robber was the slowest in reaction. He merely managed to climb over the highway guardrail when Lin Qiao came up behind him. She swung her claw at him before she could even touch this robber.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>A human head was cut off and sent flying up, then fell on the asphalt highway, with blood splashing all over the ground.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t stop after making the claw attack. Instead, she made a backflip and dodged a large fireball that was striking at her. But, that wasn’t the end as a rain of ice daggers came along with the fireball.</p> <p>The superpowered robber who threw out the fireball wasn’t at a high level, merely a level-three one. But, the one who sent out the ice daggers was a level-four. He was the one who had told the others to get back.</p> <p>The two robbers moved suddenly, and their attacks were rapid and fierce.<br/>\nHowever, they still weren’t as fast as her. When the fireball fell on the ground, Lin Qiao had already dodged aside, and when the ice daggers flew at her, she flashed across the air and disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>By the time she reappeared, she had already moved to the side of the robber who had thrown out the fireball.</p>",
  "Chapter 52: Missed A Few": "<p>“Watch out!” The robber leader automatically shouted out when he saw Lin Qiao cover more than a hundred meters within a blink of an eye and come up to the fire-power robber.</p> <p>But, his shouting changed nothing, because once he finished the two words, he saw her swing her claws again, followed by the fire-power robber’s head flying up as well.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>In panic, the other robbers fired another wave of bullets at Lin Qiao. However, as she was too fast, they had no way to locate her. By the time they fired the bullets, she had already moved to another location.</p> <p>Seeing this situation, the robbers immediately gave up on attacking and turned around to run right away. The ice-powered robber leader ran the fastest, feeling that Lin Qiao was so terrifyingly dangerous. After warning the fire-powered robber and then watching her cut off his head, this ice-powered robber promptly decided to run.</p> <p>He swiftly darted into the woods and disappeared at once. The other robbers each ran in a different direction, and none of them thought about the others when they ran. They fled in any path they could without heeding which they chose.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked the slowest one, suddenly increasing her running speed to chase after him. In a few seconds, a scream was heard from a short distance away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao returned a while later, holding some clothes and weapons. Clearly, she had taken the robber’s clothes and weapons after killing him. When she walked out of the woods, the clothes in her hands suddenly disappeared.</p> <p>She walked to the fire-powered robber, quickly glanced at Xie Dong, who was still retching, then left him alone. Afterward, she lowered her head and began stripping the robber.</p> <p>Smelling the blood, Lin Qiao felt something in her stomach. The feeling was surging, seeming about to break out of her body; but, she strictly suppressed it.</p> <p>Xie Dong wasn’t able to suppress hunger, but she was. She wouldn’t let herself eat human beings so easily.</p> <p>After retching for quite a while and throwing up nothing, Xie Dong finally gave up. After that, he stood up and wiped the blood from his mouth with his sleeve, then turned around and walked back.</p> <p>He checked the battle situation and found that besides the fat man that he killed at the start, two naked head-less corpses were also lying around. Right now, Lin Qiao was stripping the fat man. Because of the strong blood scent in the air, the hunger that he had just suppressed immediately arose again.</p> <p>Xie Dong paused for a moment in shock. <em>‘What happened just now? Is this over already?’</em></p> <p>After ripping off the fat man’s clothes with some efforts and putting those into her space, Lin Qiao stood up and looked at him. His face was still blue, his eyes contained a deep gloominess, and his expression was dark as well.</p> <p>He had eaten a human heart, but mentally, he couldn’t accept this fact. It seemed that he was disgusted with himself, which was why he showed such a dark expression.</p> <p>There was no psychological burden for Lin Qiao and Xie Dong in killing those robbers at all. After all, killing used to be their job before the old world ended.</p> <p>Therefore, she saw herself as getting rid of the evil for the other people. Those robbers had brought themselves to Xie Dong anyway, and she surely wouldn’t show any mercy. But, a few of those robbers had run away.</p> <p>The few who had run would continue hurting others.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the car, opened the door, and sat into the driver’s seat, then quietly waited for Xie Dong to come in.</p> <p>Seeing her get into the car, Xie Dong understood that he couldn’t stay in this place any longer. He followed her to the car and sat into the backseat. His mind was filled with the feeling from earlier on when he ate the heart. On one hand, he was submerged in the incredible taste of the human heart which had given him a physical pleasure; but on the other hand, he trapped himself in the sense of guilt for eating a fresh human heart.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that his mind was now unclear, and his emotions could be unstable. Therefore, she replaced him as the driver for the time being.</p> <p>She started the car and continued driving forward. The further away from the city they got, the more desolate the environment became. But still, many cars with corpses in them could be seen along the highway.</p> <p>Not long after Lin Qiao drove the car away, three figures came up fleetingly. These three creatures were incredibly fast, such that they could cover more than tens of meters with one leap. The one in the front was even able to cover a hundred meters with one jump.</p> <p>Soon, the three figures arrived at the place where Lin Qiao and Xie Dong were stopped by the robbers earlier on, then stopped moving.</p> <p>It was none other than that level-five ice-powered zombie leader, which had been catching up with its two underlings.</p> <p>It stopped, standing in the middle of the highway and sniffing around, seeming to be confirming something. The two behind it didn’t have as much worry as it did, directly rushing at the few warm corpses once they arrived on the scene.</p> <p>However, they didn’t begin feeding right again, but found the two heads which were cut off by Lin Qiao and served them to the level-five zombie.</p> <p>After confirming that Lin Qiao’s vibe had once appeared in this place, the level-five zombie glanced at the direction that Xie Dong’s car was moving in, then turned back and looked at the human heads that its underlings handed it.</p> <p>It seemed to feel that since Lin Qiao and Xie Dong hadn’t gone far, it was alright for it to spend a short while in eating here, as it would catch up with them again anyway later on.</p> <p>It took over a human head and cut it open with its claws like cutting a melon. Then, it held the head with one claw and inserted its other claw into the broken head, digging out some white brain matter and putting that into its mouth to chew with relish.</p> <p>It finished one head soon, then cut another one open and continued eating.</p> <p>Seeing that the level-five zombie leader had eaten two heads, the two level-five zombies turned to the third head which belonged to the fat man simultaneously. In the next second, they pounced at it together.</p> <p>With that, they started a fight before the fat man’s body. They scratched each other for a while, but never fought with their real strength.</p> <p>“Roar!” Maybe because the zombie leader was annoyed by this pointless fight, it suddenly turned its head and roared at the two level-three zombies.</p> <p>The two immediately quieted down, standing by the fat man’s body without moving.</p> <p>The zombie leader threw away the emptied head in its hand and then walked over. It neatly cut off the fat man’s head and picked it up, then cut it into two and threw at the two level-three zombies.</p> <p>The two zombies each caught half of the head, holding it with both their hands as they squatted and buried their faces in it to begin wolfing. They didn’t have the ‘elegant table manners’ as the zombie leader did. The zombie leader dug the brain out with claws, but they directly bit into it.</p> <p>At that moment, the zombie leader turned the fat man’s body over and found that his heart was gone. Then, it straightened its body and glanced at the other two headless heads, then walked over. Next, it dug out the heart of the fire-powered robber with a claw, put it near its nose to sniff, but then gave an expression of dislike.</p> <p>It bared its teeth, but didn’t throw the heart away. Instead, it put the heart into its mouth and took a bite, then its expression became complicated. Face filled with dislike, it forced itself to eat the heart.</p> <p>That heart had stopped beating long ago, so its scent and taste couldn’t be compared with the heart that Xie Dong had dug out earlier.</p>",
  "Chapter 53: Chapter53 – Hot Pursuit": "<p>Zombies fed on human beings. Many survivors didn’t know yet that zombies could die without food, although their death would only happen slowly. The lower level zombies could live longer without eating than the higher level ones because they were sluggish and didn’t need much energy. They loitered slowly and lazily because they had nothing to eat.</p> <p>The higher level zombies had intelligence, nimble bodies, and superpowers, but all these needed to be supported by energy. Without eating human beings, high-leveled zombies would gradually degenerate into low-leveled zombies, and then the zombie virus in their bodies would begin to lose activity. When the virus in their bodies was completely dead, these zombies would become ordinary corpses and rot.</p> <p>As low-level zombies had great resistance to hunger, they could live for three to five years without food, but would become slower and slower. High-level zombies didn’t have such great resistance to starvation. Normally, a high-level zombie could only live for a year without food. Without eating human beings, they needed to find other energy resources, such as zombie nuclei.</p> <p>However, zombie nuclei were merely temporary substitutes.</p> <p>Among all human organs, the heart contained the nutrition which was the best for high-level zombies, and tasted much better than the other parts of human bodies. The blood in human hearts had a richer flavor than the blood from the other parts.</p> <p>Therefore, high-level zombies would always eat the heart first, because that was their staple food.</p> <p>The zombie leader finished two heads and two hearts, leaving the rest to the level-three zombies.</p> <p>When they had almost finished, the zombie leader cast a roar for summoning them to continue chasing Lin Qiao. The three zombies seemed like swiftly running beasts as they darted in the direction which Lin Qiao was driving in.<br/>\nAfter half an hour, Lin Qiao found that she had driven onto a bridge. The bridge wasn’t long, only about eighty meters; but the problem was… it had already collapsed.</p> <p>She parked the car at the end of the road and then stuck her head out of the car window to get a clearer look at the front. Looking at the broken bridge, she sighed and turned back to glance at Xie Dong, finding some change in his face. His face seemed to be paler than before, but the lifeless bluish color was gone.</p> <p>Xie Dong had seen the road condition too, and learned that they couldn’t proceed along this road.</p> <p>At the moment, he was a lot calmer than before. He still felt very uncomfortable, but had been learning to endure it slowly.</p> <p>Besides, his body had changed a little as well. He felt that he was nimbler, and his muscles were less stiff and senseless compared to before; moving had become much easier for him. He even felt that his control over his power that he had before turning into a zombie had started to come back.</p> <p>He also had a faint feeling that his mind was much clearer than before. He had felt confused and unreal earlier on, but that feeling was gone now.</p> <p>He looked at the front, then raised a hand to point behind, and then crooked his finger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew what he meant. He wanted Lin Qiao to drive back because there was another road about ten kilometers away, and that detour was the only available path now.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then started the car and turned it around, driving back.<br/>\nHowever, she suddenly braked hard after a few kilometers. Xie Dong’s eyes were dazzled before he realized what was happening, and then he found that both he and the car were already in Lin Qiao’s space.</p> <p>As for Lin Qiao, she was standing on the grassland outside the car at the moment.</p> <p>Less than three seconds after Lin Qiao’s car disappeared on the highway, a figure darted to where it was.</p> <p>“Roar!” The figure circled around, then suddenly raised its head to let out an angry roar which sounded like that of beasts.</p> <p>In her space, Lin Qiao had her eyes closed to check the situation outside, and couldn’t help but frown.</p> <p>This zombie leader had actually been chasing after her all this time. Lin Qiao assumed that this zombie had to absorb the nucleus in her head to vent its anger. How could it be so vengeful? It was such a misfortune for her to encounter this zombie.</p> <p>Xie Dong opened the car door and got off the car with confusion. He had no idea why Lin Qiao suddenly bought both of them and the car into her space, but judging by her hasty look, she might have sensed some danger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened her eyes when she heard the noise that Xie Dong made, then saw the confused look in his eyes. So, she took out the pen and a piece of paper, and started writing— <em>‘That level-five zombie has caught up.’</em></p> <p>Having finished writing, the look in her eyes darkened, and fierceness surged in those black eyes.</p> <p>She needed to figure out a way to take out that level-five zombie! But, she felt that she wasn’t strong enough to defeat it at the moment, not to mention that it had two level-three underlings.</p> <p>As for Xie Dong, he looked like a level-three intelligent zombie; but in fact, his actual combat capacity wasn’t even as good as that of an ordinary level-two zombie. That was because he hadn’t eaten a human being, and hadn’t been getting energy from human flesh and blood.</p> <p>The two level-three zombies had both eaten human beings, which was why they reached level-three. Undoubtedly, they were strong and brutal.</p> <p>Therefore, Xie Dong couldn’t even rival one of them.</p> <p>On the other hand, the pressure that Lin Qiao sensed from the level-five zombie seemed to be a little lighter than before. This meant that she had grown stronger than before, but she didn’t know how that happened. All she knew was that this improvement started since she was struck by Wu Chengyue’s lightning.</p> <p>Thinking about that, Lin Qiao was confused a little. The other zombies needed to eat human flesh or absorb zombie nuclei to improve their strength. But for her, absorbing the energies contained in zombie nuclei and crystal nuclei were both ineffective, but being struck by lightning worked. Why was that?</p> <p>What the hell was going on? Did she need to find that man and ask him to strike her with lighting when she wanted to improve her strength again?</p> <p>Was this a joke?</p> <p>Reading her note, Xie Dong paused slightly and then knitted his brows as well. He looked at Lin Qiao, his eyes asking a question.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ran away every time she saw that level-five zombie, but to keep running wasn’t a solution. All this while, Xie Dong believed that she should be no weaker than that level-five zombie. As for why she ran away at the sight of that zombie every time, Xie Dong guessed that it might because she didn’t want to fight. After all, once a fight was started, both of them would suffer, and maybe pay a serious price.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed his thoughts when looking him in the eyes, so she wrote on the paper—’I <em>am no match for it. I’ll be the one defeated if we fight. I don’t want extra troubles for now.’</em></p> <p>She didn’t want to fight the level-five zombie here, as the only thing she wanted was to find her family. After all, some unpredictable results could be caused if she started the fight. For example, if she lost the fight, or were disabled from moving, she would have to spend more time to recover.</p> <p>She hadn’t heard a thing about her family yet. She didn’t even know if they were alive or not. So, she had, in fact, been quite anxious; but had rationally restrained her emotions so that she could calmly accept the fact that she was a zombie, then find the path to South.</p>",
  "Chapter 54: The little Follower": "<p>After reading her note, Xie Dong stopped feeling confused. He glanced at Wu Yueling, who was standing on the grassland at a distance, staring at him and Lin Qiao with the little rabbit held in her arms.</p> <p>In the next instant, he turned and walked toward the small space.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a moment sensing the situation outside. She saw the level-five zombie circling the highway where the two disappeared from, not seeming to give up. So, she planned to not go out for the time being.</p> <p>Having understood the situation, she walked toward Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Since no one knew when, the little rabbit had become quite close with Wu Yueling. However, it was only willing to come near her, and would leap away once Lin Qiao approached.</p> <p>…Like right now.</p> <p>Wu Yueling watched the rabbit jump away, not seeming to mind that. She was shy and really quiet. She had been staying in Lin Qiao’s space so quietly all the time, without crying or screaming.</p> <p>She didn’t even ask Lin Qiao to let her out.</p> <p>She was terrified of Lin Qiao at first, but not anymore. She was actually staying quite comfortably in this place by now.</p> <p><em>‘Doesn’t she miss her dad?’ </em>Lin Qiao wondered, <em>‘I heard her calling her dad in her mind quite a lot at first.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that this kid did have a big heart, and wondered if she worried that she might not be able to see her dad ever again, as she didn’t look anxious at all. The other kids would have wanted to go out to find their families long ago if they were in the same situation.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao walk over, Wu Yueling stared at her with her big watery eyes, looking very adorable. Her eyes were black and round, and her cheeks were pinky and chubby.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to her, saw that she had finished all the strawberries in the bowl. So, she picked up the bowl and turned to walk toward the strawberry field. After making two steps forward, she felt that the little one was following her.</p> <p>She turned back to glance at the little one, then continued walking forward without saying anything.</p> <p>After walking into the strawberry field, she checked all the plants which had been growing healthily for ripe strawberries. She had picked almost all the ripe fruits these days, but many strawberries left on the plants were almost ripe.</p> <p>The little one didn’t eat much, and these strawberries were large. So, two or three strawberries could fill her stomach.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that the child needed to eat something other than strawberries as well. She had finished the cookies which were found in the small space earlier, but she hadn’t eaten the instant noodles. That was because Xie Dong hadn’t regained the control of his power yet.</p> <p>He would either boil the water dry suddenly, or fail to boil it at all. One time, he almost burned a hole in the bottom of a pot which was brought in by Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wondered if she could find some mice or other animals in this mountain area. She decided to try finding some when she got out the next time, so that the little one’s diet could be improved.</p> <p>But before that, she needed to create fire. She had no lighter in her space. Xie Dong didn’t have a lighter either, because he had been using his own fingers as matches. He used to be a giant lighter himself.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao was picking strawberries, Wu Yueling followed behind her without doing anything else. Lin Qiao couldn’t sense her thoughts or read her mind, so she had completely no idea what this kid was thinking about.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked seven or eight strawberries to fill the bowl, then brought them to the lakeside to wash them. Wu Yueling followed her to the lakeside and silently watched her wash the strawberries, then took over the bowl from her hands.</p> <p>After handing the strawberries to the kid, Lin Qiao turned and prepared to water the strawberry plants. When she came back to the lakeside with a bucket, she found that Wu Yueling was still following behind her silently.</p> <p>She stopped and looked at Wu Yueling, who was looking at her as well, her bright eyes widely opened.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found no emotion from the child’s eyes, and couldn’t sense her thoughts either, so she didn’t know what the kid wanted.</p> <p>Therefore, she turned around to continue fetching water while Wu Yueling following behind her. When she got back to water the strawberry plants, Wu Yueling still followed her. After that, she again went to the lakeside to fetch more water, and Wu Yueling was still following her. She moved between the lakeside and the strawberry field many times, and the child followed her the whole while.</p> <p>Seeing this, Lin Qiao felt speechless.</p> <p>Having finished watering the strawberry plants, she turned around and lowered her head to look at Wu Yueling. The latter kept her head raised, staring at Lin Qiao with an adorable look.</p> <p><em>‘What on earth is this kid thinking? Why can’t I read anything from her eyes or sense any thoughts from her mind?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>She was almost driven crazy, and hoped that someone could come to save her. She didn’t know how to communicate with an introverted kid!</p> <p><em>‘What’s wrong?’ </em>Lin Qiao asked the kid with her eyes.</p> <p>However, the latter calmly looked at her without answering the question or making any response in her mind.</p> <p><em>‘Why are you following me? Do you need me to do something? Or do you want to tell me anything?’ </em>Lin Qiao tried to ask again by using sign language.</p> <p>Still, Wu Yueling made no response but kept staring at her.</p> <p>After she tried a few times, the little one remained silent and kept gazing at her without saying even one word. She didn’t’ hear anything from the child’s mind either.</p> <p><em>‘There’s no way of communication. As people said, autistic children rarely let the others know about their thoughts. So, what should I do now? Why has she been tailing me? What does she want?’ </em>Lin Qiao just didn’t know the answer.</p> <p>The two of them silently gazed at each other for a couple of seconds. When Lin Qiao scratched her head and was prepared to give up, Wu Yueling finally made a move.</p> <p>Before Lin Qiao turned around, she reached out her little hand and dragged Lin Qiao’s pants. Lin Qiao had found this pair of loose-fitting pants from the abandoned house near the strawberry field outside, and she needed to roll up the bottoms of the pant legs so that she wouldn’t step on them and fall.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stopped after Wu Yueling pulled her pants, looking at the child with confusion. Next, she saw the kid pull her own clothes. Although her little face still showed no expression, a clear dislike was detected from her eyes by Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘I need to change clothes! These are dirty!’ </em>Lin Qiao heard her saying in her mind.</p> <p><em>‘Alright! You can just tell me that! I wouldn’t know what you want if you just silently follow me everywhere!’ </em>Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>Thinking that the little one’s clothes were dirty, Lin Qiao also realized that the kid hadn’t showered for many days, so her body should be dirty as well. She must have felt uncomfortable, but didn’t know how to describe it; so, she told Lin Qiao that her clothes were dirty.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t expect this kid to be a neat freak. Most of the other kids wouldn’t mind that!</p> <p>Since the kid wanted to change clothes, Lin Qiao decided to give her a bath first, and then let her wear some of those adult clothes which had been washed earlier. Wearing those adult clothes was convenient for her, as a top would become a little dress on her. How simple was that!</p> <p>Lin Qiao also planned to wash those clothes which were ripped off those robbers, so that she could wear them herself after drying.</p> <p>With that, she jumped into action once organizing these thoughts. She led Wu Yueling to the lakeside and told her to stay put while she went to find a cotton top and a tattered coat herself. After returning to the lakeside, she put these clothes on the clean ground.</p> <p>She then squatted before Wu Yueling and looked at her while saying in her mind, <em>‘I’ll also give you a bath. Don’t move.’</em></p> <p>Meanwhile, she unbuttoned Wu Yueling’s top with both hands. Wu Yueling didn’t know what was going on, but she stood still to cooperate with Lin Qiao’s moves.</p>",
  "Chapter 55: She Has Become A Nanny": "<p>Lin Qiao took off the little one’s clothes and threw them on the ground. Then, she picked up the tattered coat, tore it into strips, and wetted them in the lake.</p> <p>After that, she wrung a strip of cloth and used it as a towel to wipe Wu Yueling’s slightly dirty face. She had to wipe that little face three times to make it clean.</p> <p>Wu Yueling closed her eyes expressionlessly, quietly letting Lin Qiao wipe her face.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found her little face to be much cuter when it was clean. Then, Lin she glanced at the kid’s long greasy hair and knitted her brows.</p> <p>How could she wash the child’s hair? She didn’t have shampoo or anything like that in her space. Probably, soaking those hair in the water for a longer while would work.</p> <p>She pushed Wu Yueling toward the lake and made her stand in the shallow water, then began wiping her body with cloth strips.</p> <p>The temperature in Lin Qiao’s space was constant, neither hot nor cold; and so was the temperature of the lake water. As a zombie, Lin Qiao couldn’t sense the water temperature, but Wu Yueling wasn’t like her.</p> <p>Stepping into the water, Wu Yueling found that it was a little warm, and not cold at all. In fact, her skin was colder than the water. Maybe because she had taken off her clothes, she felt comfortable and interested in the warm water. However, as an introverted child, she wouldn’t show her feelings.</p> <p>The other kids might have begun to frolic in the water already.</p> <p>Lin Qiao also stood in the water. After wiping Wu Yueling’s little body, she began showering her with the lake water.</p> <p>She felt that this child had brought her a lot of extra work. She needed to find her food, make her bed, and now she needed to bathe her; after this she needed to wash her clothes…</p> <p>She suddenly realized that she has become a zombie nanny!</p> <p>She should have sent the little one back to her father as soon as she could, because life would have been much easier that way. But now, she had taken the kid away, so she needed to be responsible for her! Even though this made the kid’s dad anxious, it wasn’t easy for herself either!</p> <p>Furthermore, Wu Yueling didn’t like to talk or communicate with her. She felt that this child was quite boring; but in fact, she disliked naughty and noisy kids so much that once she got near those kids, she would feel perturbed, and her head would even ache.</p> <p>If Wu Yueling hadn’t been so quiet that sometimes Lin Qiao even forgot that the former was there, the latter wouldn’t have really taken this kid with her. She would definitely throw her back to that man who looked nice but wasn’t at all.</p> <p>To be honest, Lin Qiao didn’t know why she really kept the little one…</p> <p>Wu Yueling was standing quite still when Lin Qiao bathed her. But suddenly, she raised a foot and quickly ran up behind the latter, hiding behind her legs and sticking her head out to look at the lakeside.</p> <p>Seeing her strange behavior, Lin Qiao raised her head to look at the same direction, then saw Xie Dong standing a short distance, staring at the naked Wu Yueling with his eyes glowing.</p> <p>It might be the obvious desire in his eyes which frightened Wu Yueling and made the kid hide behind Lin Qiao.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao even wanted to call the police and tell them that she had found a pervert.</p> <p>She straightened her body and gave Xie Dong a warning glare.</p> <p>Receiving the glare, Xie Dong woke up immediately, then began to wonder why she stared at him in such a strange way as if he was a pervert.</p> <p>And then, he finally recalled what he was trying to do by coming here in the first place. He wanted to tell Lin Qiao something, but he was again tempted by Wu Yueling’s nice aroma when he saw Lin Qiao bathing her; so, his mind stopped working for a moment.</p> <p>However, the glare and the strong pressure from Lin Qiao cleared his mind instantly.</p> <p>He looked at Lin Qiao while walking toward her. He didn’t get too close, stopping about five meters away from the lakeside. Then, he raised a hand with his palm turned up. Next, a small flame which looked like a flame on a lighter rose from his palm, swaying gently.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s eyes glowed when she saw the flame, but she then told him to wait by using a hand signal. After that, she turned back and continued bathing Wu Yueling. The kid’s long hair took her about ten minutes to clean up.</p> <p>The little kid had really thick hair that were waist long. Her hair were greasy, tied in a ponytail at first; but later on, the ponytail loosened.</p> <p>Lin Qiao asked her to bend her waist and face the lake water so that her hair could be soaked. She rubbed the kid’s hair with her fingers for quite a while before they got less greasy, then brought the kid ashore with wet hair.</p> <p>After giving her wet hair a wring, Lin Qiao put the adult top on her. It covered Wu Yueling up till her knees, and its sleeves looked especially long on her.</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao lifted her up and walked to the bedside, putting her down on it and letting her sit there.</p> <p>She found a coat and draped it around the kid’s shoulders as her hair were still wet. She didn’t know how to dry the kid’s hair now, but she was worried that the latter might get sick with the wet hair. So, she put the coat on her to try and keep her warm.</p> <p>After settling Wu Yueling down, Lin Qiao walked to Xie Dong. At that moment, he seemed to be practicing to control the flame in his palm, trying to prevent it from dying too fast.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked up to him, took out the pen and paper, and wrote a few words.</p> <p><em>‘Can you use your power now?’ </em>She asked.</p> <p>Xie Dong glanced at her and nodded, but then shook his head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew what he meant, that even though he was able to create flame now, he couldn’t control it yet. Besides, the flame was too small, and he didn’t know how to make it grow.</p> <p>He had eaten a human heart earlier. Before that, he couldn’t release his fire power, but now he could. Even though the flame wasn’t strong, it was still an obvious improvement. It seemed that eating human beings was indeed the best way for zombies to evolve.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao wondered exactly which level Xie Dong was at. Level-three? He was much weaker than level three zombies. But then again, he could now release his fire power, and might be able to use it more skillfully before long. After all, he remembered how he used to control his power.</p> <p>Lin Qiao assumed that he needed to eat human beings to gain energy and boost his power. Even though eating human hearts was very unacceptable for him, he should change his attitude if he wanted to grow stronger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Xie Dong for a while and then abruptly wrote on the paper,<em>‘When we’re out, let’s battle if we have the time. I want to know where’s the limit of your strength.’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong nodded in agreement after reading the note. He too wanted to know that. However, looking at her dark eyes, he felt that his a*s would be kicked thoroughly in this process.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Xie Dong from head to toe, then turned back to wash Wu Yueling’s clothes.</p>",
  "Chapter 56: The Reunion After Death": "<p>At this moment, Lin Yu walked into the Sea City Base. He looked glazed, his eyes were filled with a deep confusion.</p> <p>He got in. He really got in! The virus checking devices failed to detect anything abnormal from his body.</p> <p>Before getting in, he had been worrying about himself. He looked like a normal human being, but he couldn’t tell if it was because the virus was resting inside his body, and he didn’t know if he would start turning into a zombie once he was checked by the devices.</p> <p>However, he cleared his own doubts when he saw those zombies which hungrily pounced on him. If he truly harbored the zombie virus, why would those zombies charge at him?</p> <p>Therefore, he finally decided to try entering the base first. If he couldn’t, he would have to wait outside.</p> <p>But fortunately, he got in safely.</p> <p>After getting in, he headed to the registration department right away. After finding out that his Captain and teammates had indeed returned to the base, he went to find them.</p> <p>His Captain was a level-five ice-powered man. As a superpowered member, he was temporarily accommodated in a not-so-bad flat by the base administrators in an old residence community. Every building in this area merely had six or seven floors, and the people living here were mostly superpowered members and their families.</p> <p>In this base, it was pretty lucky to be able to live in a place like that. It was like a high-end apartment for the people in the old world.</p> <p>Lin Yu’s Captain, Li Zheng, and all his teammates were accommodated in that area temporarily.</p> <p>He asked around and finally found the location of that residence community. After locating the building where Li Zheng and his teammates lived in, he rushed up to the sixth floor and stopped before a door. He checked the room number, then raised a hand to knock the door.</p> <p>“Who is it?” The door was soon answered. An average-looking young man who was about twenty years old opened the door to look outside. When he saw Lin Yu’s face clearly, he suddenly widened his eyes, looking stunned.</p> <p>“Brother Lin Yu! You’re alive!” Three seconds later, a scream was heard.</p> <p>The others in the room were doing their own work, silently wondering who was at the door. However, they paused simultaneously when they heard the scream as if someone had pressed the pause button for all of them.</p> <p>In the next second, they rushed up to the door together.</p> <p>Lin Yu stood by the door, looked at the suddenly opened door. Li Zheng and the other few of his teammates all crowded near the door, staring at him in disbelief.</p> <p>“Lin Yu… You… Didn’t you…?” Li Zheng stuttered to ask, eyes filled with shock, delight, confusion, and all the other complicated emotions which disabled him from speaking fluently.</p> <p>The young man who had opened the door was named Feng Yuming. He widely opened his small eyes as he gazed at Lin Yu while saying, “Brother Lin Yu, aren’t you affected by the zombie virus? You… How did you…”</p> <p>The others all had a bewildered look in their eyes.</p> <p>Lin Yu smiled, then looked around alertly. After confirming that no other people had noticed him and his teammates, he said, “Let me in first.”</p> <p>Hearing him, the others quickly woke up from shock and stepped back to let him into the room. Feng Yuming shut the door after Lin Yu walked in. If anyone heard what Feng Mingyu said just now, Lin Yu and all his teammates might fall into trouble.</p> <p>After entering the room, Lin Yu found that it was a studio, tens of meters squared in area. Two bunk beds stood against the wall for the four men in the room to rest.</p> <p>Behind the beds was the kitchen and the bathroom. The kitchen was connected with the balcony.</p> <p>This type of accommodation was like a very simple and often-seen kind of shared home for workmates in the old world. The rent for a studio like this might cost hundreds of yuan per month. The living condition here couldn’t be counted as good; but fortunately, the four men who lived here all liked to tidy it.</p> <p>Aside from the two iron bunk beds was a square table and a few plastic stools in the room.</p> <p>Lin Yu grabbed a stool to sit down, then leaned against the wall and waited for the others to sit.</p> <p>While staring at Lin Yu, Li Zheng, Feng Yuming, Fei Chonglin, and Lei Yao each found a seat. Their sharp gazes seemed even to tear him apart to examine every inch of him and then put all the pieces back together.</p> <p>Lin Yu faced their gazes with a complicated feeling. He knew that they were all very curious about what happened to him. Even he wanted to know what exactly had happened.</p> <p>He remembered that he had locked himself in an empty warehouse, then fell unconscious. When he woke up, he found that he didn’t become a zombie. But before falling unconscious, he had sensed some strange changes in his body indeed.</p> <p>Back then, he couldn’t move, and his limbs were slowly turning stiff. His head ached so badly that he had slowly fainted. But when he woke back up, he found that he was perfectly fine. He could run and jump like a healthy human being, and even his blood continued to be red.</p> <p>But later on, he found something—a pair of tooth marks on his chest, seeming to be left by sharp canines which had pierced into his skin. He thought he was bitten by some kind of animal, because those tooth marks didn’t look like they were left by zombie teeth.</p> <p>Lin Yu organized his thoughts, then began talking while four pairs of eyes filled with curiosity were fixed on him. “In fact, I don’t know what happened either. I locked myself in a warehouse. I wanted to kill myself at that time, but I couldn’t raise my gun because my head ached too badly. So, I fell unconscious. I didn’t know how long I slept, but then I woke up to find that I was still in the warehouse, perfectly fine,” he said.</p> <p>The others stared at him with disbelief on hearing what he said. Li Zheng frowned slightly and asked, “Did you find anything strange around you? Or, has any part of your body mutated?”</p> <p>“Yes,” Lin Yu nodded and responded.</p> <p>“What was it?” Asked Li Zheng immediately.</p> <p>“I checked the door of the warehouse which I locked, but it was pried open. I felt that something had entered the warehouse while I was unconscious!” said Lin Yu.</p> <p>He trusted his teammates very much. After all, they had been acting together as a group ever since the apocalyptic era began, helping each other to survive in this dangerous world. This time, his teammates never thought about giving up on him even when he was scratched by a zombie, but he asked to stay behind to cover them retreat himself.</p> <p>Therefore, he wouldn’t keep secrets from these people.</p> <p>A concerned look was shown in the eyes of the others when they heard Lin Yu say that something had entered the warehouse while he was there alone and unconscious.</p> <p>“What was it?” Li Zheng asked.</p> <p>Lin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know. When I woke up, there was nothing in the warehouse. The door was open, but the zombies nearby didn’t come in.”</p>",
  "Chapter 57: Come Out Alive From A Hopeless Spot": "<p>The others in the room looked at each other after hearing what Lin Yu said.</p> <p>Having finished speaking, Lin Yu abruptly rolled up his sleeves, raised his left hand, and pulled out the dagger from the sheath tied around his thigh with his other hand.</p> <p>“Brother Lin Yu, what are you doing?” Feng Yuming hurriedly asked as he was startled by Lin Yu’s sudden move.</p> <p>“Look,” While speaking, he cut his own skin with the sharp dagger and left a bleeding wound on his hand. The red blood which looked exactly like that of healthy human beings immediately gushed out of the wound, dripping to the ground.</p> <p>“The blood is red, this means your body is alright at the moment,” looking at Lin Yu’s blood, Li Zheng made a judgment. Lin Yu didn’t say anything but glanced at the four, maintaining his posture.</p> <p>“The wound…” Among the two who hadn’t talked all this time, a tall man suddenly let out a word with a muffled voice.</p> <p>Lin Yu looked at him and smiled. As he expected, this man, Lei Yao, who seemed to have strong muscles and a simple brain, looked a little dull, but was actually the most observant one in the room.</p> <p>Reminded by Lei Yao, the others immediately focused their eyes on Lin Yu’s wound, then found that it was healing itself! His self-healing was happening very slowly, but was real!</p> <p>Seeing this, all four of them widened their eyes in shock.</p> <p>They all clearly knew that Lin Yu was an ordinary man without a super power. He didn’t have a healing power, so his body wouldn’t possibly be able to heal itself.</p> <p>The pair of eyes on Lei Yao’s expressionless face slightly narrowed as he asked, “Is that… healing power?”<br/>\nLei Yao’s sentence was short, but the others understood his meaning. They immediately fixed their eyes on Lin Yu’s face again, waiting for him to give an answer.</p> <p>Lin Yu shook his head and responded, “It’s not a superpower. It’s because my body condition has changed.”</p> <p>That wasn’t his superpower. Instead, his body had somehow gained this self-healing ability, and it was only effective on himself.</p> <p>The others had slight traces of disappointment flash across their eyes when they heard what Lin Yu said; but, what was more obvious in their eyes was a relief. Soon, they began to feel delighted for Lin Yu.</p> <p>“Great! Now, we don’t have to worry that you might die because of slight carelessness!” Li Zheng sighed in relief and said.</p> <p>Li Zheng said this because Lin Yu was the weakest in the team. He didn’t have any superpower, so his teammates needed to worry about his safety in every action.</p> <p>But at that moment, Lin Yu gave a meaningful smile and said, “That’s not all… See this!”</p> <p>While speaking, he put the dagger back into the sheath, then raised his right hand slightly with his palm up. After that, he concentratedly gazed at it.</p> <p>As the others were wondering what he was doing, a black flame suddenly rose from his palm. The flame was small, only about an inch tall, standing on his palm, perfectly still without swaying at all.</p> <p>At the sight of this small black flame, the others leaped backward simultaneously, running away in panic like startled cats with bristled fur.</p> <p>Within a blink, the four had run as far away from Lin Yu as they could. They stood in the furthest corner that they could find from Lin Yu, staring at him with faces filled with a frightened look.</p> <p>“The netherworld fire!” Lei Yao, who reacted the fastest and hid in the bathroom, stuck his head out from behind the door and shouted at Lin Yu’s palm. The typical expressionless look in his face was gone, replaced by fear and shock.</p> <p>Fei Linchong reacted slightly slower than Lei Yao. Half of his head was stuck out below the latter’s, so that he could see Lin Yu.</p> <p>Li Zheng and Feng Mingyu had hidden in the corners in front of Lin Yu.</p> <p>Lin Yu was amused. He looked at them and said, “You don’t need to be you nervous. My netherworld fire is not even one percent as powerful as our chief leader’s! And, my fire has to touch a man to hurt him.”</p> <p>While speaking, he put the fire out, then rereleased it; then, repeated over and over again, seemed to be having fun.</p> <p>The other four were a little speechless at this point.</p> <p>They hadn’t overreacted. Lin Yu’s fire was exactly the same as the fire of one of their Hades Base’s leaders. The Hades Base was very famous, for no other reason but that base leader’s mysterious fire power.</p> <p>“Really? Oi, stop playing with it! Just put it out!” Fei Chonglin said with doubts when he saw that Lin Yu was playing with the fire quite joyfully. He felt terrified at the sight of that fire, and only wished that the latter could put it out as soon as possible and stop scaring the others.</p> <p>Lin Hao clenched his fingers and put his right hand down, then said, “That is my superpower. You guessed it right, as it is the same kind of fire as our leader’s. But, my fire needs to touch its target to harm it. It won’t deliver any effect without direct contact, because it won’t release the toxic gas that way.”</p> <p>Seeing him put the fire out, the four slowly and carefully walked out from where they were hiding. However, they no longer dared to get near him, staying about one and a half meters away from him.</p> <p>“Brother Lin Yu, is that the superpower you triggered after you fell unconscious and woke back up? You were scratched by zombies, yet you survived… And in addition to that, you triggered a superpower! I never thought that could happen! That is too… magical!” Feng Mingyu said with curiosity.<br/>\nHe automatically turned back to glance the others after saying this, who all looked at Lin Yu and nodded.</p> <p>They never heard that healthy human beings could survive after being wounded by zombies, and trigger superpowers on top of that. As far as they knew, all humans injured by zombies would be affected by the zombie virus, then slowly become zombies themselves. The zombie virus was seriously horrifying!</p> <p>Almost all who were affected by the zombie virus died. No one in the few large bases had ever heard anything about the virus being able to trigger superpowers.</p> <p>The powers of the current superpowered people in this post-apocalyptic world were either triggered when the old world ended, or by all other kinds of factors; but, the zombie virus wasn’t included.</p> <p>Lin Yu didn’t become a zombie, which was already miraculous. And to everyone’s surprise, he actually triggered a superpower. That was just plain unbelievable!</p> <p>Li Zheng stared at Lin Yu from head to toe, then asked with a confused look, “How did this happen? What exactly happened to your body?”</p> <p>“I have no idea either. I became like this when I woke up,” said Lin Yu, shaking his head.</p> <p>The others didn’t know what to say. Lin Yu was so lucky that even that could happen to him!</p> <p>He was lucky enough to survive after being wounded by zombies and gained a self-healing ability; and upon that, he triggered a superpower!</p> <p>He came out alive from a hopeless situation! And, merely his self-healing ability was enough to make the others jealous!</p>",
  "Chapter 58: Because of The Tooth Mark": "<p>“Brother Lin Yu, your self-healing ability is awesome, and so is your power!” said Feng Mingyu excitedly.</p> <p>Speaking of Lin Yu’s power, the others again felt curious. “We never thought that you’d trigger the poisonous fire power. How powerful is your fire now?” One of them asked.</p> <p>Lin Yu didn’t say anything but stood up and looked around the room. At last, he spotted the trash in the trash can. He walked over, took out the trash along with the trash bag, then put it on the floor.</p> <p>After that, he turned his palm and threw out the black flame. The flame lightly landed on the trash bag, and in the next moment, the bagful of trash quickly melted and disappeared without leaving even ashes on the ground.</p> <p>After the trash disappeared, the flame continued standing straight on the ground. Soon, the floor underneath it dented.</p> <p>It looked like the flame had devoured the things that it touched, but in fact, those things just melted too fast. It was truly a little horrible that the flame could even melt floor tiles.</p> <p>Seeing that the floor tile had begun melting, Lin Yu hurriedly waved his hand, and the small flame flew back into his palm.</p> <p>The others looked at the flame which had flown back into Lin Yu’s palm in surprise, then at the spot where it had lingered. A small dent was left on the floor.</p> <p>“This is just the same as our chief leader’s fire power when it was at the elementary level. The effects are about the same,” said Feng Mingyu.</p> <p>Lin Yu shook his head and responded, “Not exactly the same. My fire has no scent, so the surrounding people wouldn’t be poisoned when I release it. It’s still different from our leader’s fire.”</p> <p>“But, it has the same look and delivers the same melting effect as our leader’s fire,” said Feng Mingyu.</p> <p>“That’s true.” Lin Yu nodded and agreed to that.</p> <p>Li Zheng calmed down and said in a deep voice, “Let’s not tell anyone about this for the time being. You should all mind what you say from now on. Do you get it?”</p> <p>The other three nodded knowingly. After all, what happened to Lin Yu was way too miraculous. If the people in the Sea City Base knew about that and informed their leaders, those base leaders might lock him up to run all kinds of experiments on him.</p> <p>It was a great deal that he could resist the zombie virus, and apart from that, he had gained the self-healing ability and superpower. Therefore, anyone who had even a little ambition would want to know how to achieve that.</p> <p>“Lin Yu, just now you said that someone had entered the warehouse while you were unconscious, but didn’t it do anything to you, eh?” Asked Lei Yao.</p> <p>Lin Yu shook his head confusedly and replied, “Something did come in at that time, but I don’t know if it did anything to me or not… I was unconscious.”</p> <p>The others glanced at each other as they all felt regretful. If they knew what had entered the warehouse, they might be able to figure out what exactly had happened to Lin Yu.</p> <p>“But…” Lin Yu looked at them, his eyes containing hesitation.</p> <p>“What it is?” The others stared at him with confusion.</p> <p>Then, Lin Yu lifted his cloth to expose his chest. They had surely seen each other naked. They were even familiar with each other’s naked body, so they had discovered two tiny holes on Lin Yu’s smooth and muscular chest.</p> <p>“What are those?” Asked Feng Mingyu. Everyone’s eyes immediately focused on the pair of holes on Lin Yu’s chest.</p> <p>“They look like… tooth marks? And it seems to be left by some kind of animal’s canines…” said Lei Yao while pondering.</p> <p>“Lin Yu, have you been molested by some kind of beast?” Li Zheng stared at him and asked with a strange look.</p> <p>“Can’t you be serious?” Lin Yu rolled his eyes and said.</p> <p>Hearing him, all the others showed a smile in their eyes. “So how did that happen?” Asked Fei Chonglin.</p> <p>“I found these tooth marks the next morning after I woke up in the warehouse,” Lin Yu responded questioningly, “I don’t even know when these were left on my body. If I have to explain it, I’d say that these were left by the thing which entered the warehouse while I was unconscious.”</p> <p>“These two tooth marks are very deep. Even though your body has healed itself, it failed to erase these scars. So, I wonder if the changes of your body are related to these tooth marks,” said Lei Yao with a muffled voice.</p> <p>Lin Yu nodded and said, “I think so too. Otherwise, why didn’t I turn into a zombie, but had these tooth marks left on me? And, these don’t look like a zombie’s bite marks.”</p> <p>The others all nodded. “It sounds like that, but it can’t explain your current condition. However, whatever has happened to you, you came back safely, and that’s enough. None of the other things matters,” Said Li Zheng.</p> <p>While speaking, he stepped forward to pat Lin Yu on the shoulder. Recalling how he and his teammates had abandoned Lin Yu, he felt exceptionally guilty, and so did the others.</p> <p>Hearing Li Zheng, the other three fell silent. These days, the fact that they abandoned Lin Yu had been stuck in their minds making them extremely uncomfortable. However, as they were on a mission, they had to keep their grief bottled up and make themselves forget that they had lost a brother.</p> <p>But now, the brother whom they thought that they had lost was back, perfectly unharmed. And, he was even stronger than before!</p> <p>Lin Yu laughed out loud when he saw the sorrowful look in his teammates’ faces. “Yeah, you see, I’m really hard to kill. I’m back, so you don’t need to look after Yan for me when return to our base,” he said.</p> <p>“Have you seen the Purple Thunder Leader of the Sea City Base?” He then changed the topic suddenly.</p> <p>Their mission this time was to talk to one of the three leaders of the Sea City Base. They had heard that the leader was a kind and decent man.</p> <p>Hearing him mention the mission, the others stopped looking sorrowful. Li Zheng shook his head and said, “Not yet. He went out of the base with his soldiers, and hasn’t returned yet. So, we couldn’t see him.”</p> <p>Lin Yu paused shortly and asked, “Out of the base? For what? Collecting resources? We came at a bad time then! So, are we waiting for him to come back now?”</p> <p>Li Zheng nodded and responded, “I’ve asked some people, who said that he has been out for about a month. I think he’ll be back soon, so we’re now waiting for him.”</p> <p>“We still have some time. The Chief Leader will be free to act once she has sent her family and Chief Captain out,” said Lei Yao.</p> <p>At that point, all five men in the room had their faces darkened, covered in coldness and hatred.</p> <p>“We’ll be able to do whatever we want to deal with those people once Chief Leader has sent her family away!” Said Feng Mingyu angrily, “A bunch of ambitious scums! Do they think they can take out our Chief and make the base their own just like this? I think Chief will definitely destroy the base instead.”</p> <p>“Chief does intend to do so if she has to,” Li Zheng agreed with him, “Otherwise, why would she let the Chief Caption and her family retreat secretly?”</p> <p>“…And send us here to talk to the Sea City Base’s Chief Leader about cooperation,” Fei Chonglin added.</p>",
  "Chapter 59: Confirmed News": "<p>As Fei Chonglin said, their mission this time was to come to Sea City ahead of time and talk to the Base’s Chief Leader. In fact, they had traveled for nearly a month before arriving at the Sea City Base. If they hadn’t encountered a group of fierce post-apocalyptic world robbers and lost their car to them halfway, they might have arrived long ago.</p> <p>Post-apocalyptic world robbers were all psychos who would die for food. They would even eat human beings if they got too hungry. Therefore, in order to accomplish their mission, Lin Yu and his teammates ended their battle against the robbers as soon as they could, but let the latter take their car.</p> <p>However, the five of them didn’t know yet that their chief leader had died in a battle not long ago. She had felt that her enemies would soon take action, but had never thought that there was a mole amongst her people. Not only did the mole find out her plan and betray her, but also helped her enemies poison her.</p> <p>Chief Netherworld Fire of the Hades Base had an incredible fire power, but she wasn’t immune to all kinds of poisons.</p> <p>Her enemies knew her well enough to swat at her weaknesses. By collaborating from within with the forces from outside, five level-seven powerful people laid siege to her, who was also at level-seven. As a result, a few of the five were injured severely, and she died together with one of them.</p> <p>Her brothers and sisters managed to escape from the base, but they were all being hunted by now.</p> <p>In this post-apocalyptic world, communication networks didn’t exist. Therefore, Lin Yu and his teammates had no way of receiving a message and finding out what had happened in their base. All that they knew was their Chief Leader had given them a mission, and they now needed to accomplish it.</p> <p>They stayed in the Sea City Base to wait for the Chief Purple Thunder to return, but they had no idea that the man they had been waiting for was chasing a zombie which had abducted his daughter, and the ones who came back were only his deputy commanders and leaders.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In a rest station near the base, Xiao Yunlong sat in the only leather double couch in the room. A few of the soldiers were scattered around him, a couple of them standing on his both sides and two behind him, while two guarded by the door.</p> <p>Three meters away, three people were standing in front of him with their hands tied behind their backs.</p> <p>Those were two men and a woman, none other than Lin Yong, Liu Hongshi and Liang Caiyan.</p> <p>The tall and strong Xiao Yunlong leaned against the back of the couch, putting one arm on the couch’s back while the other hand fiddled with a pistol.</p> <p>“Do you mean that the woman has become a zombie already?” While speaking, he looked at the pistol which was spinning in his hand instead of the three people.</p> <p>The three glanced at the soldiers who were standing aside while pointing rifles at them, not daring to move.</p> <p>“That’s right! We were going to let her lead us to Chief Purple Thunder’s daughter. We don’t know where the little girl is, as only she knew that. We wanted her to take us there so that we could save the girl from that woman and send her back to Chief Purple Thunder. But, we didn’t think that she…” said Lin Yong calmly.</p> <p>“Send her back? Can you be so nice? Hilarious…” Xiao Yunlong interrupted him coldly. He sneered and continued, “Of course you wanted to send her back! Or, Yang Hao would kill you even if we let you live, wouldn’t he? In order to get rid of that boring woman, he involved our little Yueling and made her missing. You have to give our chief an explanation about that, don’t you?”</p> <p>Lin Yong and the other two lowered their heads, not daring to face Xiao Yunlong’s sharp gaze. Sweat oozed out of their foreheads immediately.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong had already seen the truth, so whatever they said now would be useless.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong’s face darkened as he stared at the three fiercely and said, “So…what now? You get that woman killed and make ur little Yueling missing. Do you think your lives are enough to compensate for our little Yueling?”</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>Before his voice faded, the pistol which was spinning quickly in his hand was suddenly gripped by him, and then three gunshots were heard.</p> <p>He didn’t even warn them. Before the three could realize what had happened, a bullet sank into each of their heads, leaving a thumb-sized hole with blood gushing out.</p> <p>They widely opened their eyes and softly fell on the ground, faces filled with confusion.</p> <p>“Toss them out,” Xiao Yunlong put the gun back into the holster, then stood up and said, walking out of the room.</p> <p>“Yes, sir.” The few soldiers in the room responded immediately, then quickly began moving the bodies.</p> <p>After walking out, Xiao Yunlong said to the deputy commander by his side, “Send the message to Chief and tell him that the woman is dead. And, send some people out to check the surrounding area… See if we can find the zombie turned from that woman, or her chewed body.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir. I’ll do it now.” The deputy commander nodded and responded instantly.</p> <p>Looking at the back of his deputy commander, Xiao Yunlong wanted to laugh, but instead, he sighed and hoped that the little girl would be fine.</p> <p>…</p> <p>As Xiao Yunlong sent his people out to verify Lu Tianyu’s death, Lin Qiao was looking for mice in the grass.</p> <p>She was hungry; sensing Wu Yueling’s scent every day made her hungrier and hungrier. But, she couldn’t go out of her space to find food, because the level-five zombie was waiting of her outside.</p> <p>Therefore, she thought of the baby rabbit in her space. But, she then remembered that the rabbit seemed to have become a friend of Wu Yueling. Would the little one be sad if she ate the rabbit? Lin Qiao didn’t want to take the risk, so she had no choice but to give up. Then, she suddenly recalled that before she threw the rabbit in her space, she had also put in a few furless baby mice.</p> <p>She didn’t know if the few little mice died or not. She assumed that they were dead, because there was no adult mouse to feed them, and so many days had passed.</p> <p>However, another voice in her heart had been telling her that those baby mice were still alive. Therefore, she bent her waist to search for those tiny things among the grasses which were taller than her knees.</p> <p>As she began searching, she really confirmed that those baby mice didn’t die, although she had no idea where they were. The grass nest she made for them earlier was empty by now.</p> <p>She and Xie Dong were two zombies, Wu Yueling was a human kid; except for them, the only other visible living being in her space was the little rabbit.</p> <p>Rabbits didn’t eat meat, so if anyone had eaten those baby mice, that would be one of the other three. As the little girl had been eating strawberries and couldn’t possibly eat raw mice, it would be either Xie Dong or herself. However, after observing, she found that Xie Dong was only interested in human flesh, and disliked all other kinds of animals.</p> <p>Earlier on, Xie Dong refused to even look at the little rabbit when Lin Qiao handed it to him.</p> <p>Therefore, after ruling out all kinds of possibilities, Lin Qiao concluded that no one in the space had eaten those mice. She didn’t know if other creatures existed in her space, but she had been living here for so long without seeing any, unless it was something in the lake…</p> <p>She thought about this over and over again, and still felt that those baby mice were still alive.</p> <p>Therefore, she crawled into the grasses to look for them, but failed after trying for quite a while. She had excellent eyesight and hearing now, and her sense of smell was even sharper than that of dogs. Yet, she still couldn’t find those baby mice.</p>",
  "Chapter 60: Fight the Level-Five Zombie": "<p>Xie Dong stayed in the small space, trying to gain better control of his fire power. Wu Yueling had stopped following Lin Qiao around after the latter gave her a bath. Instead, she sat on the bed which the latter had prepared for her with the rabbit in her arms. From time to time, she would raise her head to look at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave up on finding those baby mice after failing a few times. She couldn’t find them, which was so unexplainable. Those baby mice couldn’t fly into the sky, could they?</p> <p>She walked to a flat area by the lake to sit down, then closed her eyes to sense the outside situation. She found that the three high-level zombies were still circling the highway, showing no sign of leaving.</p> <p>It seemed that this time, the level-five zombie wouldn’t leave until it had found something. Lin Qiao couldn’t help but feel a little headache on thinking about that.</p> <p><em>‘As a zombie, why are you so vengeful? I did nothing more than snatch your prey, but you can just find another one. Do you really need to keep chasing me like this?’</em>Lin Qiao complained silently. She felt that the zombie leader had a higher IQ than the other zombies, and would hold a grudge for a much longer time as well.</p> <p>She couldn’t let this level-five zombie keep interfering with her journey back home. And, it felt really awful to hide every time she saw it. She thought for a moment and then decided to go out and fight it!</p> <p>She could always run if she failed to defeat that zombie leader! She could run pretty fast now! She couldn’t yet leap really high and move forward very fast by thrusting all fours against the ground like the other high-level zombies. She didn’t want to do that either, because that set of movements looked way too ugly. However, she could still run at a considerable speed with her two legs.</p> <p>Besides, she hadn’t had a chance to find out what the limit of her speed was.</p> <p>As for the level-three zombies, Xie Dong might not be able to defeat them with bare hands at this moment, but using a gun was quite a convenient way. Even though a gun could barely hurt higher level zombies, it could still manage to threaten the level-three ones. As long as he could react faster than the two level-three zombies and seize the opportunity to fire the gun before they could launch an effective attack, he would be able to take them out easily.</p> <p>After forming a plan in her heart, Lin Qiao stood up immediately and walked toward the dark entrance of the small space. Sensing her coming toward the entrance, Xie Dong stopped playing with the fire in his hand and turned back to look at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao handed him a piece of paper which had a few lines written on it.</p> <p><em>‘I’m going out to fight that level-five zombie. I want you to go with me. We can’t keep staying in my space.’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong nodded, then quickly armed himself. His power wasn’t working very well yet, but he had a gun. As a former special forces soldier, he was fearless!</p> <p>In fact, he had been expecting Lin Qiao to let him out and have some fun… or, to get some fresh air.</p> <p><em>‘Run if you can’t defeat them. You don’t need to worry about me. If we get separated, you can head straight for South. We’ll see each other again at some point.’ </em>Lin Qiao then wrote on the paper, reading which, Xie Dong nodded in agreement.</p> <p>After all, they might not be able to defeat that level-five zombie even by joining forces; but, as they didn’t want to keep waiting, they had no other choice but to fight as hard as they could.</p> <p>When Xie Dong was ready, Lin Qiao dragged his arm, and then, both of them disappeared from the small space.</p> <p>Once they were out, both of them struck first to gain some advantages, especially Lin Qiao. She had scanned the two level-three zombies before coming out, and had told Xie Dong about their location and the distance between the enemies and themselves. Therefore, they fired the guns held in their hands the moment they came out, sending bullets flying toward the foreheads of the two level-three zombies who weren’t far away from them.</p> <p>A series of machine gun fire could be heard as two figures flashed out of thin air.</p> <p>All the three zombies paused briefly when Lin Qiao and Xie Dong showed up. The mere one-tenth of a second’s pause was long enough for the two experienced former special forces soldiers to hit their targets.</p> <p>The level-five zombie leader reacted the fastest. It roared out loud then flew at Lin Qiao swiftly.</p> <p>The two level-three zombies moved slower than their leader. By the time they realized what had happened, the bullets had already sunken into their heads.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Xie Dong neatly finished off the two underlings of the zombie leader once they showed up.</p> <p>The level-five zombie turned back to glance at its two underlings which had fallen to the ground when it rushed at Lin Qiao. However, it only conveniently cast a glance, but didn’t pay too much attention. It had a clear target, which was Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After shooting the two level-three zombies, Lin Qiao immediately turned her gun to fire at the level-five zombie. However, the level-five zombie was so fast that she couldn’t manage to hit it with the bullets.</p> <p>She was aware of that, because she herself was also able to see the flight path of bullets, which weren’t flying too fast even in her eyes.</p> <p>Seeing that the level-five zombie didn’t take the bullets seriously and just flew ferociously at her, Lin Qiao threw away the gun and then flicked her dark nails.</p> <p>When the zombie leaped high and dove down at her from the air, she suddenly bent her legs and then rolled backward, dodging the zombie’s claws which slashed at her.</p> <p>While she was rolling backward, a claw of hers swung at the level-five zombie’s chest.</p> <p>The two of them separated after the first strike. Lin Qiao rolled on the ground again then sprung back up immediately, alertly staring at the zombie leader which had rolled backward as well. And then, she noticed that four very deep wounds were left on its chest, looking like the wounds caused by swords.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Those…’ </em>Lin Qiao murmured in her head while gazing at those wounds.</p> <p>The expression in the zombie leader’s face froze as it curiously lowered its head to check its chest, and found that its bulletproof skin was actually wounded by another zombie which was weaker than itself.</p> <p>It watched its own black and sticky blood flowing out of the four uneven sized wounds. It couldn’t feel pain, but it did feel rage.</p> <p>It raised its head and widened its eyes, cocked its brows and bared its teeth to utter deep and weird roars at Lin Qiao. She heard it and understood what it meant, so she couldn’t help but to want to laugh.</p> <p>She heard the zombie leader say— <em>‘How dare you scratch me! I’ll bite you to death!’</em></p> <p>It was a zombie leader, but it actually had such childish thoughts.<br/>\n<em>‘So, NOW you want to bite me to death? Then what have you been doing earlier?’</em>Said Lin Qiao silently.</p> <p>She didn’t let out any sound, but had a smile on her face. The mocking smile in her eyes was pretty obvious, and the zombie leader was smart enough to understand it. Therefore, it became even angrier, and roared resonantly at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After that, it again pounced on Lin Qiao fleetingly, and wiped its own chest with a claw in the meanwhile. With that, the few wounds immediately stopped bleeding, and were covered by a thin layer of frost.</p> <p><em>‘It knows how to stop the wounds from bleeding with its power,’ </em>Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>Next, the zombie leader charged at her at an incredible speed, with a fierce murderous intent, a strong vibe, and a series of flying ice daggers.</p> <p><em>‘This is bad!’ </em>Lin Qiao said in her head once she saw the ice daggers which were flying toward her from all directions. She immediately gave a hand signal to Xie Dong, who had been silently watching the fight, then turned back to dart into the woods aside.</p>",
  "Chapter 61: The Intense Fight In the Woods": "<p>As Lin Qiao thought, this level-five zombie wasn’t only strong physically, but also had a super power. No wonder level-five superpowered human beings were no match for the zombies at this level, because average physical attacks could hardly harm them!</p> <p>This time, Lin Qiao wouldn’t have been able to do any harm to the level-five zombie leader if her fingernails hadn’t upgraded to release the sharp air blades.</p> <p>After telling Xie Dong to retreat by using a hand signal, Lin Qiao turned and leaped away. In the next moment, a palm-wide ice blade pierced into the ground along with waves of cold air, but didn’t melt right away.</p> <p>The ice blades created by level-five superpowered human beings couldn’t pierce into the ground, but would only shatter into pieces against the ground. However, this level-five zombie’s ice blade managed to cut into the ground; although it did not go too deep, it had shown its powerfulness nevertheless.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao turned and ran immediately. She also tried to draw the zombie leader away and allow Xie Dong to run by himself, in case it lost its temper and decided to vent its anger on him.</p> <p>The zombie leader speeded up to chase after her right away on seeing its ice blade miss her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t panic under the great pressure given by the zombie leader. Instead, she raised her speed and calmly ran toward the woods. She seemed to be a little unreliable normally, but every time in a serious action, her mind would become very clear and rational, without giving her any chance to be flustered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao obtained this good mental quality through her training in the army, and it had become a part of her instincts. The more dangerous the situation was, the calmer she would be.</p> <p>Sensing the zombie leader chasing after her like a cheetah, she ran toward the area with more obstacles on purpose. The woods, as well as places with tall grasses and stone riprap could be included in her escape route. Even though she had been choosing these difficult areas particularly, nothing had impeded her at all. On the contrary, she was running as swiftly and briskly as a mouse, and even seemed to be quite enjoying it.</p> <p>The zombie leader following behind Lin Qiao had its eyesight blocked by the surrounding woods and grasses. And because it was really angry at the moment, it hadn’t been concentrating to sense her moves.</p> <p>Once it entered the woods area, it generated a wave of freezing wind and ice blades to sweep across the surrounding plants.</p> <p>Ordinary human beings wouldn’t dare to enter any woods area, but zombies weren’t afraid of the potential dangers in there, because those could barely harm them.</p> <p>Before entering the woods, the zombie leader was moving at a very high speed, but it slowed down by thirty percent once it did, as the surrounding obstacles blocked its eyesight. Then, it sensed that Lin Qiao was running further and further away, so it turned anxious.</p> <p>However, it had its own solution, which was leaping high up. It directly leaped to the top of a tall tree, then stood high and found the direction which Lin Qiao was moving in. After that, it nimbly jumped to the top of another tree like a monkey.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed the zombie leader’s vibe, so she turned back to glance at it. Then, she found that the zombie leader had climbed onto a tree, which meant that the situation had started turning against her.</p> <p>She didn’t stop, but continued running forward. When she ran past a large rock, she suddenly paused, turned around, and twisted her body, then rolled to one side.</p> <p>Following a series of puffing noises, a small wave of ice thorns fiercely landed where Lin Qiao was a moment ago. The finger-thick ice thorns fell on the ground and the rock. The ones that hit the rock shattered it into pieces, and the rest pierced straight into the ground.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quickly glanced at those ice thorns before she turned and continued running. Those ice thorns wouldn’t cause any pain of they hit her, but would pierce very deep into her body. She didn’t want tens of deep holes in her already-broken body, because she would look intolerably ugly that way! Furthermore, those holes wouldn’t be able to heal! She was already ugly enough, and if she got even uglier… In fact, she couldn’t think of any bad effects of being uglier.</p> <p>Since she was now a horrible-looking zombie, she couldn’t possibly find anyone to marry her, could she? Who would dare to marry her? Should she get a zombie husband? She didn’t think so! She had way better taste than that!</p> <p>Even at such a dangerous moment, Lin Qiao could think of the boring questions such as marrying someone. If the zombie leader that had been chasing behind her knew what she was thinking, it would definitely have been infuriated.</p> <p>She rolled on the ground again to dodge another attack. Once she stood up, she heard a series of swishing noise from above her head. So, she squatted back down without even taking a glance where the noise came from.</p> <p>Right after she bent her waist, the zombie leader leaped across her head, but was a little too high above her. Its claws failed to touch Lin Qiao’s head, only grabbing the air.</p> <p>“Roar!” Failing to hit the target again, the zombie leader flipped in the air before landing on the ground, then let out a wave of raging roar toward her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at its chest and found that the few wounds caused by her had already been frozen by a white layer of ice.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! It even knows how to dress its wounds!’ </em></p> <p>At that point, the zombie leader realized that its roars were ineffective on Lin Qiao, and this wasn’t the first time for that to happen. The zombie leader was able to control other lower level zombies, but it couldn’t figure out why this one could always ignore it.</p> <p>Based on her vibe that the zombie leader had sensed, it always believed that she was merely at level-three, and hadn’t even reached level-four. Therefore, the situation of being able to control the other level-three zombies except her had irritated it quite badly.</p> <p>For this reason, it had been chasing her and trying to defeat her with violence. But to its surprise, she was way too good at running.</p> <p>In fact, it no longer cared that she had snatched its prey. It kept chasing her mainly because it wanted this lower-level zombie to be under its control. It just felt so uncomfortable when it couldn’t do that.</p> <p>Meanwhile, being targeted by this zombie leader, Lin Qiao had been trying to figure out a way to escape from it.</p> <p>As expected, she was lower than the zombie leader in levels, as it could climb trees and leap between treetops across long distances. Lin Qiao didn’t think that she could do the same, because her jumping ability wasn’t as good as her running ability.</p> <p>Therefore, when she saw the zombie leader nimbly leaping between treetops, she knew that she couldn’t escape from it.</p> <p>Level-five zombie leaders were truly hard to deal with!</p> <p>Right at that moment, the zombie leader flashed across the air and charged at her.</p> <p>She had been staring at it the whole time. Seeing it pounce on her suddenly, she stepped back immediately while crossing her arms before her face to defend herself. Then, she felt a strong impact force from her arms, along with a fierce vibe.</p> <p>The zombie leader directly clawed at her hand.</p> <p>The moment the zombie leader’s claw slapped on her hand, she stopped stepping backward, then immediately twisted her waist and turned her upper body to drag it aside. After that, she raised a foot to kick its stomach.</p> <p>The zombie leader didn’t take her kick seriously, so she managed to kick heavily into its stomach. In the next second, it was sent flying backward.</p>",
  "Chapter 62: She Did Something Stupid": "<p>“Roar?” The zombie leader flew back confusedly. Lin Qiao looked skinny, and could only run on the ground even when escaping, So, the zombie leader assumed that her kick wouldn’t be as strong as its own kicks. Therefore, it took her kick carelessly, but then found that it wasn’t like what it thought</p> <p>As a result, it was sent flying away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao always knew that she had a great strength, but she didn’t think that she could kick the zombie leader to such a long distance away; so, she paused shortly in shock as well. But in the next second, she rushed toward the flying zombie leader at a higher speed while raising both hands to slice its head.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie leader had sensed the danger as it hurriedly flipped backward in the air, dodging her claws. After landing on the ground, it roared at her angrily, then thrust its legs against the ground and pounced on her, who was still in midair. A series of ice blades were released from its palms, flying at Lin Qiao from all directions.</p> <p>Seeing those ice blades, Lin Qiao knew that the zombie leader was truly infuriated right now. Hundreds of ice blades were falling from above her head, leaving her no way to dodge. So, she had no choice but to return to her space.</p> <p>The next second, Lin Qiao vanished into thin air before the ice blades could pierce into her body, even before she landed back on the ground. The rain of ice blades fell onto the ground, leaving hundreds of holes on the plants in this area.</p> <p>“Roar!” As Lin Qiao disappeared again, the zombie leader bared its teeth and uttered an angry roar toward the sky. Then, it turned back to scratch the surrounding plants and rocks ferociously, creating another scene of devastation.</p> <p>Lin Qiao showed up in the flat area by the lake after entering her space. She stood there and closed her eyes to sense the situation outside. Seeing the angry zombie leader, she couldn’t help but want to laugh.</p> <p>The zombie leader couldn’t enter her space no matter how pissed off it was. She had a space, so who would she be afraid of?</p> <p>But soon, she began feeling upset. She managed to flee into her space, but how was she supposed to go back out? She now realized that she had done something stupid, which was getting out of her space. The zombie leader seemed to have learned that she would reappear in the exact same spot where she disappeared from. If not, why did it wait on the highway for so long? Earlier on, Lin Qiao showed up again on the highway. Didn’t she prove the zombie leader’s guess by doing that?</p> <p>Thinking of that, Lin Qiao even wanted to punch herself. What had she done? She pushed herself into a troublesome situation. She was too worried about her family, so she ignored some details. But, now that she came back to her senses and found that she was wrong, it was already too late.</p> <p>She watched the zombie leader vent its anger, then leap onto a very tall tree aside and squatting on top quietly. It silently waited there like a predator which had been patiently waiting for its prey to show up.</p> <p>It was apparently waiting for her to come out! It seemed that she had really underestimated the zombie leader’s IQ.</p> <p>With that, she opened her eyes.</p> <p>She hoped that she could enter that ‘traveling ghost’ state again or dream another ‘moving dream’ to leave this place.</p> <p>Recalling what happened the last few times when she changed her locations without leaving her space, she eagerly wanted to do it again, but didn’t know how. She had no idea how to cast that skill! What kind of a moment should she be waiting for that?</p> <p>While she was trying to figure out how to put that skill in use, she suddenly felt her head turn heavy. Then, as she felt that something was summoning her, she began falling unconscious. This was the exact state that she had entered the last time. However, she didn’t show up on the outside as a transparent figure this time, and instead, her body directly turned transparent in the space.</p> <p>Wu Yueling had been looking at Lin Qiao from a short distance away. She began to feel strange since Lin Qiao suddenly showed up by the lakeside and stood there motionlessly. Soon, she saw that the latter’s body slowly turned transparent, but didn’t disappear completely.</p> <p>At least, she could still see Lin Qiao’s transparent body.</p> <p>She widened her eyes to stare at Lin Qiao, her face filled with curiosity. She wasn’t worried or scared, because many strange things had happened since she met that zombie. She had learned that she shouldn’t see the latter as an ordinary zombie.</p> <p>Wu Yueling didn’t know how to describe the fact about ‘shouldn’t be seeing Lin Qiao as an ordinary zombie’. Yet, her simple mind understood that the latter wasn’t the same as the other zombies, and that she was the only zombie which wouldn’t show the horrible ‘I-want-to-eat-you’ look to her.</p> <p>So, she curiously looked at the transparent Lin Qiao and watched her slowly walking into the lake. As she kept walking deeper and deeper into the lake, the water went over her knees, thighs, then waist; but, she didn’t seem to want to stop. She kept moving, and the water reached her chest, neck, mouth, nose, and then her eyes.</p> <p>Soon, Lin Qiao disappeared into the lake.</p> <p><em>‘What is it doing down there?’ </em>Wu Yueling wondered.</p> <p>At first, Wu Yueling was only curious about what Lin Qiao went down into the lake to do. She guessed that maybe the zombie went down to catch fish, and wondered would it come back up with a large fish and make grilled fish for her.</p> <p>While waiting for Lin Qiao to come out of the water, she quietly looked where she had disappeared, with all those thoughts flashing across her mind.</p> <p>However, she started feeling uneasy as she didn’t see Lin Qiao come out of the water after waiting for a long while. As time passed slowly, Wu Yueling felt that she couldn’t sit still anymore. So, she got off the bed, held the rabbit, and walked toward the lake.</p> <p><em>‘Why doesn’t it come out? Why doesn’t it come out yet? Why? Come out!’ </em>Wu Yueling shouted in her heart.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After walking into the water in a muddleheaded state, Lin Qiao realized what she was doing. However, she suddenly found that she couldn’t control her body, even though her mind was clear again. She had no choice but to watch herself walk deeper into the lake, and watch the water go over her head. She didn’t stop after that, but kept moving toward the center of the lake.</p> <p><em>‘What’s happening? Why did this happen? What’s going on?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt like an outsider who was watching Lu Tianyu’s body going deeper and deeper. Meanwhile, she saw the world under the water. She was a zombie, so she wouldn’t be suffocated, and could move freely underwater.</p> <p>When her body went deeper, and the water went over her eyes, she saw a green light underwater!</p> <p>The water surface looked deep and dark, but a green light was glowing underneath it. As a zombie, Lin Qiao was color blind, so she was really shocked when she recognized the green color of the light.</p> <p>After she became a zombie, everything she saw was black and white, boring and dull. However, why could she see this mysterious green light now? And more importantly, what was it?</p>",
  "Chapter 63: The Strange Thing That Happened At The Bottom Of The Lake": "<p>Before she could figure out what that green light was, she felt her feet get squeezed, and then something coiled on her lower legs. She realized that she had regained the control of her body.</p> <p>However, before she could react, she felt that the thing coiled around her legs were climbing up quickly on her body.</p> <p>She lowered her head to look at it, and was startled.</p> <p>She saw countless glowing green vines climbing up her legs like snakes, and soon wrapped her legs and waist.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! What the hell are these!’ </em>She screamed in her head.</p> <p>Her scalp was numbed when she looked at these things. She tried to struggle, but failed. She found that these vines weren’t wrapping her too tightly even though they looked terrifying; but strangely, she wasn’t able to free herself from them.</p> <p>She tried to pull them off. These vines were soft and slippery, and quite elastic. She couldn’t unwrap them or pull them apart, and couldn’t even cut them off with her sharp nails!</p> <p>She didn’t feel uncomfortable being wrapped by these vines, only weird. She felt that her clothes were melted, because the vines seemed to be sticking to her skin directly.</p> <p>She felt her skin was slightly numb and itchy.</p> <p>She actually had feelings! As a zombie, she now actually felt numb and itchy! Why did that happen? What on earth were these vines?</p> <p>Before she had an answer, these vines had reached her chest and neck, then soon wrapped her head, only leaving her pair of dark eyes unwrapped.</p> <p>After being wrapped in the vines, she felt that she was again in that ‘traveling ghost’ state; but this time, her mind continued to be clear.</p> <p>Sensing that slight numbness and itch, she slowly relaxed her limbs. And then, the numbness and itch gradually seeped into her muscles from her skin.</p> <p>She now caught a very odd feeling. She felt that her mind was drifting, seeming to float up; she felt like she was lying on a soft cloud, feeling quite comfortable.</p> <p>However, before she could enjoy that feeling, she suddenly sensed a slight pain from her brain. The first wave of pain wasn’t so bad, but every following wave was worse than the previous one. Soon, she knitted her brows and woke up from that comfortable feeling.</p> <p>She felt that her brain was shaken after every wave of pain. The pain got worse and worse, and she felt more and more uncomfortable. However, she couldn’t do anything as she wasn’t able to move. With no other choice, she endured the strange pain.</p> <p>She had no fear in her head, and she couldn’t manage to think too much at that point, because her mind was occupied by the pain and disabled from generating any other thought.</p> <p>Unlike the last few times when she suffered a piercing headache, this time, the pain occurred slowly, wave by wave, as if it was giving her a time to adapt, so that she wouldn’t pass out directly like the last few times.</p> <p>As time went by, she started to feel that her head was exploding. Her face was twisted and mouth agape, exposing her sharp teeth and canines.</p> <p>She wanted to scream to ease the pain in her brain, but she couldn’t utter a sound. So, she could only shout silently.</p> <p><em>‘It hurts! It hurts so much! Ou! I want to die!’</em></p> <p>Later on, her entire body began twitching. However, she couldn’t move or struggle because those vines wrapped her up tightly.</p> <p>She felt like passing out due to pain, but didn’t. She couldn’t tell for how long she had suffered the pain, but she never passed out, not even when her eyes lost focus and turned muted.</p> <p>When she was about to be driven crazy by the pain and even forget her own name, the horrible pain suddenly disappeared, and her tense nerves loosened.</p> <p>She opened her eyes in confusion before realizing what had happened. Suddenly, a green light flashed across her eyes and disappeared. It was like a naughty little snake which was playing hide and seek with her.</p> <p>At that moment, the vines wrapped around her body loosened slowly, and began to draw back.</p> <p>Now, she finally came back to her senses. She blinked and saw that the green light had turned brighter than before, but then disappeared for good.</p> <p>The twisted expression disappeared in her face as she let out a long sigh of relief. She automatically lowered her head to look at her feet, seeing her naked legs. She was standing in a dark greenness, stepping on a ground of mysterious black soil.</p> <p>Those glowing red vines were all gone by now. They seemed to have come out of the ground earlier on and drawn back in right now.</p> <p>She glanced around, but didn’t found those vines. Then, she raised her head to look upward.</p> <p>However, she saw nothing but a greenness.</p> <p>She moved her hands and suddenly felt that something was bringing her hands upward. She was familiar with that feeling, which was caused by the buoyancy of the water.</p> <p>After moving her limbs and finding nothing strange, she turned back to swim toward the water surface.</p> <p>Soon, she stuck her head out of the water, then looked around and found that she was right in the middle of the lake.</p> <p>She also found that Wu Yueling was standing by the lakeside, staring at her with her eyes turned a little red.</p> <p><em>‘Great! She came out! Why is she still there? Why isn’t she swimming back now?’ </em>Lin Qiao sensed Wu Yueling’s thoughts from a distance away, feeling surprised. Then, she swam toward the girl.</p> <p>She didn’t think that the little girl would worry so much about her.</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Qiao had begun to swimming toward the lakeside, Wu Yueling gave a long sigh of relief in her heart, then finally stopped worrying.</p> <p>While swimming, Lin Qiao suddenly felt something strange.</p> <p>She seemed to able to sense everything in her space clearly but the lake water…</p> <p>She didn’t know how to describe that feeling. It was like she had a space in her mind and it allowed her to see and sense everything in her space, along with every change that happened here.</p> <p>Therefore, she could clearly sense Wu Yueling’s location now even when her eyes were closed. She could also sense the grasses, the strawberry plants, and the randomly placed furniture pieces. She discovered that the rabbit and the few mice which she couldn’t find earlier had all gone underground!</p> <p>However, she felt a strange vibe from the lake, but she didn’t know what it was.</p> <p>When she finally swam ashore and walked out of the water, she realized that she was naked.</p> <p>She lowered her head to look at her body, and then she was dumbfounded again.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! What is this? What on earth happened to me down in the water just now!’</em>She screeched in her mind.</p>",
  "Chapter 64: The Recovery Of Her Body": "<p>Lin Qiao lowered her head, stared at her own legs in disbelief. The skin of her legs was as pale and bluish as before. Even though the skin color looked a little scary, her skin was smooth and tight, and her legs were long and straight.</p> <p>However, the few bone-deep wounds caused by zombie claws and teeth on her thighs and lower legs, were all gone!</p> <p>In the wound areas, her flesh and skin which was bitten off by zombies had grown back. But, the skin in these areas wasn’t the same as the rest of her skin. Her old skin was bluish pale, yet the new skin was pink, looking like the skin of a normal human being’s healed wound after its scab fell off.</p> <p>The wounds on her thighs didn’t heal as well as those on her lower legs did, but had changed quite obviously as well. The black and dead tissues in those wounds had all fallen off, and white muscle fibers had grown out of the broken muscles.</p> <p>She turned her eyes to her stomach and found that the hole in her stomach was still there, with her intestines still torn. The wounds on her chest didn’t seem to change either.</p> <p>She raised a hand to touch her face, and found that it was still filled with bumps and hollows.</p> <p>Then, she lowered her head again to check her legs, and confirmed that those wounds on her legs were truly gone.</p> <p>She really wanted to study the changes in her body now, but standing here and letting the little girl watch her naked body didn’t seem to be appropriate. She wasn’t a pervert after all!</p> <p>Therefore, she walked to the lakeside and gestured for Wu Yueling to not look.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was curiously looking at her body, and wasn’t scared by it. Knowing that Lin Qiao didn’t want her to keep staring at her, she obediently raised a little hand to cover her eyes.</p> <p>However, as her hand was only big enough to cover one eye, she kept staring at Lin Qiao with the uncovered eye.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed, then moved swiftly. She picked some clothes which were ripped off from robbers, then fled into the small space as fast as she could.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was incredibly fast, so Wu Yueling saw nothing but a figure flash across the air before finding that she had disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was now able to sense her space and almost everything in it, but she couldn’t control the things here.</p> <p>After quickly putting those clothes on, she walked out of the small space to the furniture area to check on Wu Yueling, and saw that she had gone to chase the little rabbit after she disappeared. She didn’t try to catch the girl’s attention again.</p> <p>She sat on the couch and rolled up her pants to carefully check her lower legs.</p> <p>She touched her skin and found that her calf muscles had actually regained the tonicity. Before, her calf muscles were so dead that the wouldn’t rebound when she pressed them, which was a normal body condition of zombies.</p> <p>Zombies wouldn’t die when they suffered physical injuries, but those injuries would never heal. Only the zombies at level-six or above could have a little self-healing power, but they needed to eat a giant amount of human hearts, blood, and flesh to gain that power.</p> <p>However, new flesh had grown out in Lin Qiao’s old wounds, and that wasn’t something a simple self-healing power could do. Although the recovery began with her lower legs, it seemed to have happened to her thighs too. So, would it happen to the rest of her body as well?</p> <p>She pulled down her pants, then turned her head to look at the center of the lake.</p> <p>She knew that the changes happened to her body were caused by the glowing green vines in the water. But, she didn’t know if that healing energy belonged to the lake water itself or something in the lake.</p> <p>What exactly was the lake water? And, where did this space come from?</p> <p>She had no idea if the recovery of her body was a good thing or not, or what would she become in the end. Would she become a living human being again? Or, would she become some strange creature?</p> <p>She thought that was way too unbelievable, but judging by the current condition of her lower legs, she felt that wasn’t impossible.</p> <p>Even though her lower legs now had new muscles, she still had no feelings, not even when she rubbed her legs or poked her skin with her sharp nails.</p> <p>The energy in the lake had altered her body. She always felt that the lake water had magical effects, but never had she thought that it could turn dead muscles alive, and the recovery could happen this scarily fast.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had experienced a lot, but she was really shocked by that.</p> <p>‘Damn! I’m not living in a fantasy novel where I can find magical herbs to heal my wounds, am I? I’m in a post-apocalyptic world!’ She said to herself.</p> <p>Even though some of her wounds had healed, Lin Qiao couldn’t tell for sure if the zombie virus in her body was killed, or it remained existing inside her.</p> <p>And, if the energy in the lake could turn her back into what Lu Tianyu looked like before she died…</p> <p>Lin Qiao narrowed her eyes.</p> <p>If that happened, the people from the Sea City Base would definitely recognize her, and she would fall in trouble! Even if she avoided offending the others, the others would find her and try to kill her, wouldn’t they? After all, that woman had done so many evil things when she was alive!</p> <p>Thinking of this, Lin Qiao suddenly felt that her head was aching! She should really stay away from Sea City as she had planned!</p> <p>If the little one’s dad recognized her, awful things would definitely happen!</p> <p>Recalling what Lu Tianyu had done to Wu Chengyue before she died, Lin Qiao wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. ‘Damn, why do I have to come back to life in this suicidal woman’s body?’ She wondered.</p> <p>Earlier on, she walked down to the center of the lake unwittingly, as if she was summoned to there. So, she wondered if that lake had a soul.</p> <p>Anyhow, the changes that had happened to her body were good so far. Would her entire body be healed if she stayed longer in the water? But, she didn’t want to try it again, because her heart was still fluttering with fear caused by that horrible pain she suffered down there,. Therefore, she decided to wait for a while instead of torturing herself.</p> <p>Besides, she didn’t go into the lake on her own initiative, but was summoned to the lake this time. So, she didn’t know if the energy in the lake would react when she went down there on her own. That needed to be verified.</p> <p>She thought for a while, then decided to give up on studying the source of energy in the lake. Then, she closed her eyes to see the outside world and sense the location of the level-five zombie.</p> <p>Once she started doing that, she found that her sensations had grown stronger. Before, she could only see the area where she entered her space from; but now, her view seemed to become higher and broader.</p> <p>She could even sense the level-five zombie’s vibe and the vibes of some other creatures.</p> <p>She began to wonder how she could go out invisibly and sneak away from under that level-five zombie’s eyes.</p> <p>Right at that moment, she heard a voice from her heart telling her that she was able to go out, as long as she kept her eyes closed.</p> <p>After that, she somehow followed the voice and said ‘out’ in her heart while keeping her eyes closed.</p>",
  "Chapter 65: Successfully Turn Invisible": "<p>Once she said that word silently, Lin Qiao’s eyes were dazzled.</p> <p>She was out!</p> <p>She stood in the woods, a little stunned. It was the same place where she had entered her space from. The whole area was devastated by the level-five zombie leader.</p> <p>She automatically glanced at the level-five zombie, and then immediately entered a state of alertness, preparing to defend herself and waiting for the zombie leader to dive down from the treetop.</p> <p>However, she heard no noise when she looked upward.</p> <p>The level-five zombie was still squatting on top of the tree quietly without making any move. It was as if it didn’t see her at all.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! What’s going on? Is that thing blind? I’m standing right here, but why didn’t it pounce on me? It chased me so hard before!’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>Seeing that the zombie leader made no reaction, Lin Qiao lowered her head to look at her own body. When she saw herself clearly, she paused in shock.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? What the hell? How did I become like this?’ </em></p> <p>She was dumbfounded when she saw that her body had become like a transparent plastic bag. She raised a hand in confusion and disbelief, then popped her claws.</p> <p>Her sharp claws popped out, even whooshing slightly through the air.</p> <p>The zombie leader which squatted on the treetop lowered its head to glance where Lin Qiao was standing, seeming to sense something from the air. However, it saw nothing. Hence, it glanced around in confusion, then forgot about that slight noise.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed its small moves, then raised her head to look at it. But, the zombie leader still didn’t discover her.</p> <p>She was very pleasantly surprised as she realized what was happening now. She couldn’t believe that she had truly done it: she had successfully made herself invisible and then came out of her space.</p> <p>Seeing this situation, she gently raised a foot to move to the side.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>She stepped on a dead branch. As the branch broke and made a slight sound, she froze immediately.</p> <p>She looked up, and as she expected, the slight sound caught the zombie leader’s attention instantly. It widened its dark eyes which were sparkling with a weird red-light from time to time, staring at the spot under Lin Qiao’s feet.</p> <p>It looked quite curious and confused.</p> <p>Seeing that the zombie leader didn’t dive down immediately, Lin Qiao sighed in relief. It seemed that she should be careful not to make a noise, because she couldn’t tell if the zombie leader would swoop down directly to see what exactly was down here.</p> <p>She gently took her foot back, then carefully observed the landform of this area. After that, she stepped on the thick grass without making any other sound. She turned back to see the Zombie leader, and after finding that it didn’t notice her movement, she kept moving to the side.</p> <p>After making a few steps soundlessly, she glanced back and found that the zombie leader was still gazing at the spot where she broke the branch, so she sighed slightly in relief and turned back, leaving quietly.</p> <p>After walking out on the highway alarmedly, she quietly ran further away for one or two miles, and then finally breathed a long sigh of relief.</p> <p>After that, she began worrying again. She had managed to make herself invisible and escape indeed, but the zombie leader was still waiting there for her to come out of her space again.</p> <p>And as a matter of fact, how should she make herself visible again?</p> <p>Lin Qiao tried touching her arm and found that she was able to touch herself. But, why was she looking like a transparent plastic bag?</p> <p>Did she need to re-enter her space and come out again?</p> <p>She flashed into her space once she had this idea. The moment she got in, she found that her body was no longer transparent. She saw her black battle bruises, black gun, and her pale, bluish skin.</p> <p>As her body had turned back the way it was before, Lin Qiao exited her space again.</p> <p>And this time, she was visible as she had expected; her body was no longer transparent. It turned out that she had found the way to make herself visible again.</p> <p>She decided to retry the invisible state, so that she could use that skill whenever she wanted in the future. After all, that was an advanced skill, and she needed to master it.</p> <p>She re-entered her space and closed her eyes to sense the outside world. She kept her eyes closed and said ‘out’ silently; with that, she was out again.</p> <p>After that, she lowered her head to find that she was again transparent.</p> <p>Then, she came back into her space once again and opened her eyes to check herself. After trying for a few times, she finally figured the whole process out.</p> <p>If she wanted to make herself invisible, she needed first to close her eyes in her space and sense the outside world, then bring herself out of her space by using her willpower while her eyes stayed closed. After that, she would become invisible to other creatures and would see her as a transparent figure. Furthermore, she would be released from the invisible state directly when she re-entered her space.</p> <p>So, her eyes turned out to be the key!</p> <p>Later on, she exited her space once again and brought out Xie Dong’s car. Then, she went back and showed up right beside Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Earlier on, she had discovered another skill, which was being able to appear in any spot inside her space. That was the reason why she could directly show up by Wu Yueling’s side.</p> <p>Seeing that she showed up suddenly, Wu Yueling widely opened her eyes, staring at her with curiosity.</p> <p>Lin Qiao lowered her head to look at the girl, then gently held a hand of hers. After that, she pointed at the sky with her other hand, and then brought Wu Yueling and the rabbit in her arms out of the space.</p> <p>They showed up in the car. After coming out, Lin Qiao put the kid on the front seat.</p> <p>Wu Yueling felt that her eyes were suddenly dazzled. When she saw again, she found that she was in a strange place. She tightened her face nervously and looked around. After realizing that she was sitting in a car, she looked out of the window and saw the strange woods and the broad road outside the car.</p> <p>Facing a strange environment, the little girl became nervous right away.</p> <p>She straightened her waist and held the rabbit tightly while glancing around. Meanwhile, she began wriggling on her seat, and at last, fixed her eyes on Lin Qiao who sat beside her.</p> <p>Seeing her like this, Lin Qiao understood that this kid needed some sense of security, so she bent slightly and buckled her up.</p> <p>After that, she looked at Wu Yueling while trying to communicate with her by using sign language and speaking in her heart at the same time. ‘I brought you out to play, so you won’t feel bored in there. It’s alright, you’re safe here.’ Lin Qiao said to the kid.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought that she wouldn’t encounter as many zombies as she had in the city while driving here on this road, so it was relatively safer for the little one. Therefore, she decided to bring the girl out and let her see the outside world.</p> <p>However, she didn’t expect the little one to react.</p> <p>Seeing the little one’s tightened body, Lin Qiao gently rubbed her head, then sat back into the driver’s seat and started the car, preparing to drive.</p> <p>The girl had autism, so the environment influenced her greatly. It was inevitable for her to feel nervous in a strange place. However, Lin Qiao couldn’t let the little one stay in her space all the time. More or less, the kid needed to come out to see some fresh things.</p>",
  "Chapter 66: Passing by A Small Town": "<p>Lin Qiao didn’t know if Xie Dong was nearby, but she had no time to look for him even if she did. However, she wasn’t worried, because she had told him to go straight South earlier on, so they might run into each other at some point.</p> <p>She drove the car in the direction that Xie Dong had mentioned before.</p> <p>Earlier on, she had turned the car around on the broken bridge to take another path under Xie Dong’s guidance. But, now that Xie Dong wasn’t with her, she had no choice but to take out the map and study it.</p> <p>There was a small town nearby, so she needed to take a detour of at least thirty miles to get on the highway which led to the South through another entrance.</p> <p>Guided by the road sign, she drove toward the small town.</p> <p>Half an hour later, she finally found the entrance to the town. The closer they got to the town, the more zombies she saw walking on the road. Those zombies were all attracted by the car once they heard the noise it made; they could even sense Wu Yueling’s aroma from the car.</p> <p>However, they didn’t dare to approach, because the car was surrounded by Lin Qiao’s vibe.</p> <p>After half an hour of driving, Wu Yueling had calmed down. Her body was no longer straightened, but was huddled in the seat as she gazed at the scenery which was moving backward outside the window.</p> <p>The little gray rabbit curled up on her lap quietly, letting her brush the fur on its back slowly with her fingers.</p> <p>Lin Qiao drove into the small town. While driving, she was also reading the road signs and the map which was spread on the steering wheel by her.</p> <p>After a few turns, she arrived at the central area of the town, which used to be the busiest part of this small town. The streets, buildings, and parks in this area all remained recognizable.</p> <p>According to the map, after passing through this area, she would see another road in the front; after driving seven or eight miles on that road, she would be able to enter the highway which she was on before through a branch nearby.</p> <p>While driving, Lin Qiao’s ears twitched suddenly as she seemed to hear something from the housing estate not far ahead. When the car was getting closer and closer to that area, Lin Qiao began to sense some thoughts brokenly.</p> <p><em>‘So hungry…Hungry…Food…There’s food…’</em></p> <p><em>‘In here…Food…So hungry…’</em></p> <p><em>‘So hungry…So hungry…Hungry…Delicious…So delicious…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that these simple and repetitive pieces of information were coming from some zombies’ instinctive thoughts the moment she heard them. But, what made her feel strange was that she had sensed a lot of similar thoughts from that direction. However, these thoughts seemed to come from a large number of zombies instead of just one.</p> <p><em>‘Hungry…Eat…Want to eat…Hungry…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Food…Here…Here…Food…Hungry…’</em></p> <p>As Lin Qiao was trying to figure something out, she suddenly sensed a different thought which was mixed among the zombie thoughts.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p><em>‘Piss off! Get away from me! Piss off!’ </em></p> <p>An angry roar was heard from a distance away, made Lin Qiao stop out of curiosity.</p> <p>She could sense the emotion contained in that voice, which was that of extreme anger and anxiousness. The anger she could understand, but why was the voice’s owner so anxious? And, that voice seemed to come from a zombie as well, but it was meant for the other zombies.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt more and more curious. Apart from the voice, she also sensed a strange vibe.</p> <p>She turned to look at Wu Yueling, then decided to go and take a look… because that vibe she sensed belonged to a human being.</p> <p>She turned the car around, then drove toward where those thoughts and that voice came from.</p> <p>Once she drove into the gate of the housing estate, she saw a large group of ordinary zombies. They had crowded around the entrance of a small building, seeming to want to swarm in, but were stopped by something.</p> <p><em>‘Eat…Eat…Eat…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Want to eat…Want…Food…Smells good…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Smells nice…Hungry…Eat…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Food…in there…Food…Food…’</em></p> <p>Once near here, Lin Qiao began to receive more information which gave her a headache.</p> <p>She parked the car aside, then turned to Wu Yueling. Wu Yueling had already begun to feel nervous as she saw so many zombies. Seeing that Lin Qiao had turned to her, she stared at her as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to unfasten the seatbelt for her, but this move startled the kid.</p> <p>She grabbed Lin Qiao’s hands tightly, trying to stop her from unfastening the seat belt. Meanwhile, she pressed her lips together and raised her head to look at Lin Qiao with a pair of slightly red, widely opened begging eyes. She was afraid that Lin Qiao might throw her into that crowd of zombies after unfastening the seat belt.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave the kid a hand signal while looking at her in the eyes and talking to her in mind.</p> <p><em>‘I’ll bring you into </em>the space <em>. Don’t be afraid,’ </em>She said to the child.</p> <p>Maybe Wu Yueling heard what Lin Qiao said or she understood the meaning of the hand signal, or received the message delivered through Lin Qiao’s eyes, she tamely loosened her hands and let Lin Qiao unfasten her seat belt.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao held her, and then they both disappeared from the car.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p><em>‘Go away!’ </em>That voice was heard again.</p> <p>Maybe because the angry zombie had sensed Lin Qiao’s vibe, it now seemed to be even more irritated than before.</p> <p>After sending the little one into the space, Lin Qiao came back out immediately.</p> <p>Then, she opened the car door and came out of the car, turning to walk toward the zombie crowd.</p> <p>The ones in the outer circle were some ordinary zombies which were wearing ragged clothes and covered in rotten wounds. They stepped away automatically and slowly when they sensed Lin Qiao approaching.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed the aroma of a living human being once she got off the car. As she had thought, a living human being was in this place!</p> <p>In the post-apocalyptic world, some human survivors would be forced into a room or corner by a giant zombie crowd sometimes, hiding behind a mere door. These people could either wait for the zombies to break in and kill them, or luckily expect a zombie-hunting troop. In the latter case, they might have a chance to survive.</p> <p>This world had suffered five years of misery since the apocalyptic era began. In the first year, every large base would send out search and rescue teams to save people, but they had stopped doing that now.</p> <p>To the people who were stuck in a hopeless situation, a regular army from a base would be the best thing to expect. If it were a zombie-hunting troop which showed up, the situation could still be under control; but if it were those post-apocalyptic robbers, the ones waiting for help should better just kill themselves.</p> <p>But this time, what made Lin Qiao curious was the owner of that furious voice. She wondered what kind of zombie had uttered those thoughts and roars.</p> <p>She didn’t only sense the anger and anxiousness in that voice, but also felt that it was trying to protect something, and that was the reason why it had been preventing this crowd of ordinary zombies from rushing up.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao got closer and closer, those ordinary zombies moved away and gradually made a path for her. However, they weren’t willing to just leave; they stayed aside, roaring toward the building, reaching out their arms and seeming to grab something.</p> <p>“Roar!” The strange zombie roared at the same time, its voice sounding highly alert.</p> <p>It was already very angry before, but didn’t seem to be so vigilant. Lin Qiao couldn’t tell why, but she knew that those ordinary zombies weren’t the reason.</p> <p>So, she was even more curious.</p> <p>She walked past those ordinary zombies, then headed toward the stairs. After that, she found that there was an iron gate before the stairway. No wonder those ordinary zombies couldn’t get in! It turned out that the iron gate was blocking their way!</p>",
  "Chapter 67: The Zombie Which Had Lost Its Memory": "<p>When all the ordinary zombies stepped away from the iron gate under the suppression given by her vibe, Lin Qiao saw what was behind it clearly.</p> <p>She saw a female zombie with disheveled hair standing behind the gate. Its face was undamaged but ghastly pale; the rims of its eyes had turned dark-purple, and its lips had a deep purple color as well. It was baring its sharp teeth, staring at Lin Qiao alertly with its pale gray eyes.</p> <p>The female zombie looked about twenty-seven. Judging by its undamaged face, it used to be a beautiful woman, but was so skinny that its cheeks were sunken. It wasn’t tall, around five feet and six inches; it was wearing a skirt suit which was simple but fashionable styled, and seemed to be not cheap. It might have been worth one or two thousand bucks in the old world.</p> <p>It stood behind the gate with bare feet. Seeing Lin Qiao approach, it alertly took a step backward, but didn’t turn and leave immediately.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her head to sniff at the air, then sensed the human scent from a room on the left side on the second floor. That living human being should be on the second floor. However, the female zombie behind the iron gate didn’t rush up to the source of that scent, but seemed to want to come out!</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the female zombie up and down, then found that even though it had turned into a zombie, its clothing wasn’t messy. Except for the blood stain on its white shirt in the shoulder area, its clothes continued to be quite neat. It looked a little dusty, but wasn’t covered in blood like the other zombies were.</p> <p>And judging by its expression, it seemed to be intelligent.</p> <p>Based on its vibe, Lin Qiao figured that it was a level-two intelligent zombie, and was about to reach level-three.</p> <p>“Roar!” The level-two female zombie uttered deep roars from its throat as it saw that Lin Qiao was getting closer. Its voice was filled with an intense fear toward her, but it was still trying to warn her not to come any closer.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t help but admire this female zombie. It was so frightened, but refused to leave, and even roared out to warn her.</p> <p>It seemed that it didn’t want Lin Qiao to go upstairs and get near to that living human being. It was afraid that she would eat that human, wasn’t it?</p> <p>She had clearly sensed the female zombie’s desire to protect that human being. She was surprised by the fact that a zombie who wanted to protect a human actually existed. She also wondered how that zombie controlled its instinctive desire and prevented itself from eating that human.</p> <p>While pondering, Lin Qiao ignored the female zombie’s roar and walked to the iron gate, then raised her claw to swing at the lock of the gate. Next, the lock broke along with a clang, and then she pushed the gate open to walk in.</p> <p>“Roar?” The female zombie stared at the gate lock which was suddenly broken by Lin Qiao, its face filled with confusion. It had tried for a long time but failed to break this lock, yet Lin Qiao did it so quickly and easily.</p> <p>“Roar!” However, it turned extremely anxious when it saw her walking in. Step by step, it began to draw back upstairs.</p> <p>It wanted to stop Lin Qiao, but didn’t dare to make any reckless moves. It was suppressed by Lin Qiao’s powerful vibe which had been giving it a great sense of danger. It worried that she might destroy it for good once it attacked.</p> <p>However, it could never let Lin Qiao go upstairs, because something that it wanted to protect was there.</p> <p>It stepped back as Lin Qiao approached. Gradually, both of them were closer and closer to the second floor.</p> <p>A large group of ordinary zombies followed behind them. However, these zombies had difficulty in moving, let alone climbing stairs. They shambled toward upstairs, but fell after making a few steps and pushed down the ones around them. Before they all fell to the ground, they merely managed to climb two or three steps.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n<em>‘Stay away!’ </em>The female zombie roared at Lin Qiao while drawing back.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at it in surprise, because she had sensed its thoughts clearly. The fact that it was able to deliver clear thoughts proved that it was really quite smart.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wondered if she could communicate with it.</p> <p>She stopped, trying to let it know that she had no hostility. Then, she roared at the female zombie.<br/>\n“Roar?”<br/>\n<em>‘Can you understand me?’ </em>She asked.</p> <p>The female zombie didn’t relax its vigilance when Lin Qiao stopped moving, but paused after hearing Lin Qiao’s question.</p> <p>“Roar?”<br/>\n<em>‘Understand what?’ </em>It responded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at it with surprise. She didn’t expect her to really understand what she said.<br/>\n“Roar?”<br/>\n‘Do you remember who you are?’ She continued to ask.</p> <p>This question made the female zombie show a confused look. Then, it began mumbling as its voice came from its throat.</p> <p>“Hrr… loo…”<br/>\n‘Who am I? Who am I? Who am I…’</p> <p>While hearing her repeating this question, Lin Qiao also sensed the confusion in her heart. It seemed that this zombie had lost its memories before death, and forgotten who it used to be.</p> <p>“Roar?” Lin Qiao spent a while gazing at this female zombie which was repeating that question over and over again, then gave it another roar.<br/>\n“Roar?”<br/>\n‘Do you know what you are now?’ She asked.</p> <p>Hearing her, the female zombie came back to its senses, understanding Lin Qiao’s question.</p> <p>“Roar, roar…”<br/>\n‘I know, I have become a zombie. I’m dead,’ she said.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao suddenly turned back to roar at those ordinary zombies which attempted to approach. Her voice contained anger and threat.</p> <p>Those zombies began shambling backward when they heard her roar, but because of the stair steps under their feet, they again fell, even creating a zombie pyramid.</p> <p>Looking at these silly zombies, Lin Qiao felt a little speechless.</p> <p>After watching the ordinary zombies fall down, she turned back to roar at the female zombie again.<br/>\n“Roar?”<br/>\n‘Have you lost your memories?’ She asked.</p> <p>The female zombie stared at Lin Qiao confusedly, then nodded with a complicated expression.</p> <p>In fact, it was aware that it had become a zombie since it woke up a couple of days ago. It knew that it was the post-apocalyptic era now, and also had general knowledge that normal human beings should possess. However, it had forgotten its own name, and didn’t know who it was. No one was there to tell it about that either.</p> <p>This place as surrounded by a group of ordinary zombies, and it couldn’t communicate with them.</p> <p>This female zombie also knew that a human being was on the second floor. That was a child, a little child. The moment it saw that child, a strong sense of familiarity emerged from its heart. So, it immediately realized that it could be its child, because it wouldn’t feel that way if the child wasn’t related to it.</p> <p>Most importantly, that child called it ‘Mom’!</p> <p>The child’s scent made it feel starving, but every time it thought about eating the child, it would hear a voice tell her— <em>‘You can’t eat him! You can’t! You won’t eat him, and you will keep him safe! You will protect him from the other zombies.’</em></p> <p>However, that child wasn’t in good condition. He had no water or food, and had already fainted from hunger. The female zombie was anxious about it. It wanted to go out to find some food for the child, but didn’t dare to leave him here alone.</p> <p>What was more important was that it couldn’t open the iron gate downstairs.</p> <p>Therefore, it had been trying to get out of the iron gate these days, but never succeeded. It had only become a low-level zombie. Even though its mind was still clear, its limbs weren’t flexible enough. It was just a little nimbler than those ordinary zombies, but it didn’t shamble when it walked at least.</p>",
  "Chapter 68: A Zombie’s Protection": "<p>Lin Qiao could sense the female zombie’s complicated thoughts, and had learned of her situation. It turned out that she was a newborn zombie. For a zombie who had completed her transformation only days ago, the flexibility of her body was already not bad. Another good thing was that her mind continued to be clear, even though her memories were lost.</p> <p>Furthermore, she was trying to protect the human being upstairs. So, Lin Qiao thought that she could somehow save this female zombie from becoming a real monster.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n<em>‘You’re protecting the human upstairs,’ </em>Lin Qiao looked at her and said affirmatively.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n<em>‘You can’t eat him! He’s my child!’ </em></p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao mention the human being on the second floor, the female zombie immediately become anxious again and roared at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>To her, Lin Qiao was a zombie that she could communicate with, but she didn’t know if encountering her was a good thing or not. If the latter were a human being who wasn’t a robber, she could stay silent and let her take the child. However, Lin Qiao was a higher level zombie; so even though the latter had shown no hostility, she didn’t dare to be careless.</p> <p>As of now, the female zombie believed that Lin Qiao was here for the child as she had expected, and that zombies had only one reason to approach human beings.</p> <p>She stared at Lin Qiao nervously. At that point, she was actually no longer afraid of the latter, as she thought that the child might be eaten by her. The only thing she could think at the moment was how to keep the child away from her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded while observing the female zombie. Her body was in good shape, and a powerful maternal love had been radiating from her, creating a magical vibe. The woman who had never given birth would never have such a vibe.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n‘Relax, I don’t eat human beings. But, your child is barely breathing…’ Lin Qiao roared at the female zombie.</p> <p>She sensed that the child’s breath was becoming faint. Wu Yueling was in the same condition back when she found her.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao say that the child was barely breathing, the female zombie immediately showed a concerned look. However, she still couldn’t let herself believe Lin Qiao, and kept staring at her alertly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood her concern. So, she thought for a moment and then gave the female zombie another roar.<br/>\n“Roar!”<br/>\n‘I’ll be back in a second,’ she said.</p> <p>Next, she disappeared right in front of the female zombie.</p> <p><em>‘Eh?’ </em>The female zombie was stunned.</p> <p>After entering her space, Lin Qiao saw that Wu Yueling was sitting on the couch. She glanced at the girl but didn’t say anything to her. Instead, she found a clean small bowl, walked to the lakeside to wash it, then fetched a bowlful of water and exited her space.</p> <p>When the female zombie paused because of Lin Qiao’s sudden disappearance, the zombie crowd downstairs began rushing up again as the suppression given by Lin Qiao was gone.</p> <p>“Roar!” The female zombie immediately came back to her senses, and roared at those ordinary zombies. However, before her voice faded, Lin Qiao came out of thin air.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao, the female zombie and those ordinary zombies were all stupefied.<br/>\n‘Is this high-level zombie playing some kind of game with us?’ The female zombie wondered.</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao showed the female zombie a piece of paper with words written on it— <em>‘This is clean water. You can feed it to your child. If you want to save him, you had better let me see him. Otherwise, you can wait for him to die.’ </em></p> <p>The look on the female zombie’s face changed when she read that.</p> <p>She understood what was written on the paper, but didn’t know if she should trust Lin Qiao. However, she knew that Lin Qiao was right about the fact that the child was barely breathing, and that if she didn’t do something now, the child might die.</p> <p>Lin Qiao offered her a chance to save the child at this critical moment, and let her choose to believe it or not. She didn’t rush her, holding that bowl of water while quietly looking at her and waiting calmly.</p> <p>The female zombie struggled for a short while, then chose to believe her. After all, she couldn’t think of a better idea than that. She couldn’t go out to find food and water for the child, or take him out.</p> <p>She took over the bowl from Lin Qiao’s hands, then gave her a roar.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n‘You can’t get too close!’ She said.</p> <p>After that, she worriedly walked upstairs. While walking, she kept turning back to look at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded to her. As she requested, Lin Qiao kept the distance of three or four meters between herself and the female zombie while following her up.</p> <p>She came here to save the child, so she surely couldn’t stimulate the female zombie.</p> <p>The female zombie was relieved slightly when she saw that Lin Qiao had distanced herself from her. After getting on the second floor, she kept walking toward the end of the corridor.</p> <p>Lin Qiao followed behind her and saw that she stopped before the door at the end of the corridor. She raised a hand to open the door, and then walked in.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the door, but didn’t go in directly. Instead, she stayed by the door and waited while looking inside. She saw a living room and two bedroom doors. The female zombie had walked into one of the two bedrooms.</p> <p>She waited by the door for a while, and sensed the human scent from the bedroom which the female zombie walked inside. She didn’t know how the female zombie fed the water to the child, but soon, the latter came out with an empty bowl. She stood by the bedroom door, staring straight at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the group of ordinary zombies which had been coming onto the second floor, then walked into the flat and locked the door.</p> <p>After that, she disappeared from the living room, leaving the female zombie standing there, dumbfounded. However, before the female zombie recovered from the shock, two figures showed up suddenly.</p> <p>Those were Lin Qiao and a little human girl standing by her side. The female zombie looked at them and widened her eyes, which looked a little scary.</p> <p>Wu Yueling felt a little uncomfortable after being brought out from the Lin Qiao’s space. Seeing the female zombie in front of her, she automatically hid behind Lin Qiao’s legs.</p> <p>The female zombie couldn’t have imagined that Lin Qiao was with a human being as well. She had the urge to rush up to bite Wu Yueling the moment she sensed her strange scent, but her judgment suppressed that urge. As Wu Yueling was just an unknown little girl to her, she didn’t feel the strong resistance from her heart when she wanted to bite her.</p> <p>“Em-hem,” Lin Qiao coughed when she noticed the expression on the female zombie’s face.</p> <p>Woken up by Lin Qiao’s voice, the female zombie widely opened her eyes to look at her, then at Wu Yueling who was hiding behind her trustingly; with that, she felt confused again.</p> <p><em>‘What is going on? Why is this zombie taking a human child with her? Is she her daughter? And the girl seems very dependent on her!’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed all her thoughts, and felt speechless about the fact that the female zombie thought of her as the little one’s mother. She wondered how the female zombie would regard her if she knew that Wu Yueling was abducted by her, and that the previous owner of her body had raped the girl’s father…</p> <p>She took out a pen then began writing on the paper— <em>‘As you can see, I have </em>a space <em>. This little girl has been in my space all the time. You should put your child in my space, then follow me. Who do you plan to give your child to? Is his daddy still alive?’</em></p> <p>After reading her note, the female zombie’s eyes dimmed as she shook her head.</p> <p>She couldn’t answer Lin Qiao’s questions. She didn’t remember anyone. She didn’t remember who she was, or who her family and friends were. Neither did she know who the child’s father was. Therefore, she had no idea whom she should give the child to. She wanted to take the child with her, but she was worried that she might lose control and bite him.</p>",
  "Chapter 69: Strange Energy": "<p>Lin Qiao glanced at the female zombie, then wrote on the paper— <em>‘Since you don’t remember anything, you can take the child with you for now. You won’t hurt him as long as I’m here.’</em></p> <p>The female zombie looked at Lin Qiao in surprise. She didn’t think that the latter could see what she was thinking. She thought that the latter had guessed it, but what she didn’t know was that Lin Qiao knew her every thought clearly.</p> <p><em>‘Maybe I can help you send your child to a base. The bases are where the human survivors should be living in. Living with two zombies won’t be safe enough for your child.’ </em>Lin Qiao wrote on the paper.</p> <p>The female zombie nodded. She understood that sending the child to a base was the best solution, but loathed to do that. She felt that the child was his son, and couldn’t convince herself to give him to other people.</p> <p>Even though her current condition didn’t allow her to raise the child, she truly wasn’t willing to send him away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her. She understood how the female zombie felt as a mother, so she thought briefly and then wrote on the paper— <em>‘You might be able to keep him if you don’t want to send him away. But, that will be very dangerous. And, if you’re going to protect him, you need to grow stronger.’</em></p> <p>For both human beings and zombies, they couldn’t protect anyone or even themselves in this post-apocalyptic world without strength.</p> <p>The female zombie looked at Lin Qiao confusedly. She didn’t know how to strengthen herself. Although she had become a zombie, she had no idea about how a zombie should upgrade itself.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the room behind the female zombie. She didn’t write anything this time, but asked the female zombie a question with her eyes, about whether she could get in to check on the child, and also about her next decision.</p> <p>If the female zombie let her in, that would mean that she was willing to take her son and follow her.</p> <p>The female zombie stared at Lin Qiao for a second while struggling inside. Then, she took two steps to the side and moved away from before the door.</p> <p>Seeing this, Lin Qiao walked passed the female zombie with Wu Yueling, into the bedroom. This bedroom was quite neat and tidy, probably because it had never been looted by the other human survivors. Many living goods and pieces of furniture were left in this room, all in good conditions.</p> <p>After walking into the room, she saw a little boy lying on the bed.</p> <p>She walked closer to see him more clearly. The boy was in a deep sleep, and looked one or two years younger than Wu Yueling, about three years old. His face was sallow, cheeks sunken, and the rims of his eyes were dark. Apart from all these, he looked as small as a two-year-old kid, albeit very skinny. At a glance, Lin Qiao knew that it was because of chronic malnutrition.</p> <p>The female zombie walked to the other side of the bed, also looking at the boy. She started becoming nervous when she saw Lin Qiao reaching her hand toward the child in bed. But soon, she found that Lin Qiao’s fingers were clean, without the dark, sharp black claws. So, she relaxed a little.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put her fingers on the boy’s neck side to feel his pulse, then found that it was already very weak, seeming about to disappear at any time.</p> <p>She took her hand back, prepared to exam the boy’s body condition further. But suddenly, she saw something strange.</p> <p>She tried not to look too surprised when she fixed her pure black eyes on the little boy’s stomach. Her eyes were sparkling with a cold light and filled with confusion.</p> <p>The female zombie had been observing Lin Qiao nervously, as she was afraid that Lin Qiao might suddenly hurt the boy. As she noticed that strange expression on her face, she immediately turned more nervous.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt her panic, so she slightly raised a hand to signal for the female zombie to calm down while her eyes were continued fixing on the boy’s stomach.</p> <p>When she stared at the little boy’s stomach, she was looking at a very faint greenness which was flowing inside the boys’ stomach.</p> <p>She didn’t know what it was, but it looked familiar. In order to confirm, she slightly bent down, lifted the boy’s blanket, and then put her palm on his stomach.</p> <p>As she expected, she sensed a familiar energy through her palm. That was the energy she had felt down in the center of the lake in her space when she was tortured nearly to death.</p> <p>She closed her eyes to feel it carefully, and after about ten seconds, she finally confirmed one thing: this weak energy had been restoring the boy’s nearly dried up life-force. It seemed that the bowlful of water which she gave to the female zombie earlier was the source of this energy.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and took back her hand.</p> <p>Then, she took out the paper and started writing— <em>‘The water I gave you earlier has healing power. It’s slowly restoring this boy’s vitality. I think he’ll wake up in three or four hours. You take him and come with me. I need to head South and can’t spend too long in here.’</em></p> <p>The female zombie’s pale gray eyes glowed as she read Lin Qiao’s note and learned that the water had healing power.</p> <p>She looked at Lin Qiao with surprise and expectation, hardly able to believe this.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then spread her hands and signaled for the female zombie to choose if she would leave with her now or not.</p> <p>Earlier on, she didn’t know that the lake water contained that energy. But, after the water altered her body condition, she could actually see the energy, which surprised her a lot.</p> <p><em>‘Why’s that? What exactly has happened to me?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>Seeing the surprised look on the female zombie’s face, she shrugged and then wrote—’I <em>will bring everything in this room into my space. They’re all useful.’</em></p> <p>The female zombie nodded. It was the post-apocalyptic world, and who cared whom the things in this room belonged to? No one would come for these things even if they left them here.</p> <p>After getting her permission, Lin Qiao turned away from the bed and began emptying the room.</p> <p>Wu Yueling followed Lin Qiao closely the whole time. She saw the little boy lying in bed once she came in, and was looking at him curiously. A mysterious attraction seemed to always exist between children of the same age. Therefore, the moment Wu Yueling saw the boy who was only slightly younger than herself, her attention shifted to him from the female zombie.</p> <p>Now, as she saw that Lin Qiao walked away to collect the things in the room, she hurriedly reached out to drag Lin Qiao’s pants and followed her tightly. But, while walking behind Lin Qiao, she kept turning back to look at the boy in the bed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rummaged in the room. She collected the kettle and all the cups and glasses on the table. Everything touched by her would vanish into thin air.</p> <p>It would be more understandable if it were a human being who had been collecting these things, but it was a little weird for a zombie to do so.</p> <p>She opened the closet and found quite some clothes in it; some were adult wear, and some were children’s. Those children’s clothes seemed to suit the little boy in the bed perfectly.</p> <p>After seeing these clothes, Lin Qiao put all of them into her space along with the closet itself.</p>",
  "Chapter 70: The Boy Wakes Up": "<p>After collecting the table, chair, and other furniture pieces in the room, Lin Qiao glanced at the bed. Then, she turned back and walked out, collecting the things in the living room and the other bedroom.</p> <p>She didn’t miss the kitchen, sending it into her space.</p> <p>If Xie Dong were here, he could at least help her to start a fire. But, he wasn’t around at the moment, and the fire was the only thing she was lacking as of now.</p> <p>After emptying the entire flat, Lin Qiao went back into the bedroom. The female zombie was still standing by the bed, staring straight at the boy in the bed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the bed to check the little boy’s body condition, and found that the green energy was nearly consumed up. She now sensed much less lifelessness from the boy, and instead, a life-force which didn’t exist before was now radiating from his internal organs.</p> <p><em>‘I’ll bring him into my space now. You can follow me in to take a look first if you’re still worried.’ </em>She wrote on the paper and showed it to the female zombie.</p> <p>The female zombie nodded in agreement after reading it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to her and pressed a hand on her shoulder, then both of them disappeared from the bedroom.</p> <p>The female zombie couldn’t see colors; everything she saw was black and white. For a moment, her eyes were dazzled, and after that, she reopened them to see a grassland, which was gray in her eyes.</p> <p>She turned to look around in surprise, then found that this was such a large space, which contained not only a grassland, but also a lake.</p> <p>She also saw some furniture pieces placed in an area; some came from the flat that she lived in, and the rest she had never seen.</p> <p><em>‘You wait here. I’ll go bring the boy in along with the bed.’ </em>Lin Qiao wrote on the paper. Before the female zombie could respond, Lin Qiao and Wu Yueling disappeared again.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao vanished suddenly, the female zombie instantly showed a nervous look. She took a circle but failed to find her, so she could only try to control her emotions while silently praying for the former to not lie to her.</p> <p>Fortunately, she only waited for a few seconds before a bed showed up on the grass right before her. However, no one was on the bed. However, right after that, Lin Qiao showed up as well; one arm of hers held the boy, and the other held the little girl.</p> <p>Lin Qiao let go of Wu Yueling’s hand and let her run away, then turned around to put the boy in the bed.</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Qiao had brought the boy in as she had promised, the female zombie let out a long sigh of relief.</p> <p>Hearing her sigh, Lin Qiao took out the paper and the pen after setting the boy, and wrote—’My name is Lin Qiao. Give yourself a name, if you can’t remember your old one.’</p> <p>The female zombie shook her head. Judging by her expression, she really couldn’t remember her own name. But as for naming herself, she had one flashing across her mind just now when she read Lin Qiao’s note.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed her thoughts, so she wrote ‘Junjun’ on the paper, then showed it to the female zombie.</p> <p>The female zombie nodded after reading it, and then suddenly gazed at the other with surprise.</p> <p>She had that name in mind only for a moment, but why would Lin Qiao know about that? She had this strange feeling since before, but didn’t realize it until she saw Lin Qiao write ‘Junjun’ on the paper.</p> <p>After sensing her current thoughts, Lin Qiao wrote to explain—’I can sense the thoughts of all lower-level zombies, including yours.’</p> <p>She felt that she didn’t need to keep that secret from Junjun, as nothing bad would happen if the latter knew. But, she didn’t tell Jujun that she could sense the thoughts of human beings too. And, even she herself couldn’t tell if that was her superpower or a just regular ability of zombies.</p> <p>Junjun stared at her, her face filled with shock.</p> <p>She wondered if all higher level zombies could do that or if that was exclusive to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t tell her anything more about that, but turned back to look at the bed. Abruptly, she held the boy up again, then walked to Junjun as the latter stared at her confusedly. After that, she put the boy in Junjun’s arms, then crooked her fingers to signal for her to follow her.</p> <p>Next, she dragged the bed quite easily and walked toward the small space.</p> <p>Junjun carefully held the boy and followed behind Lin Qiao. She looked ahead and saw a black hole…</p> <p>It wasn’t exactly a hole, because its both sides were occupied by a white fog. It looked like a two-meters-tall, square-shaped hole in the middle of the fog, like a door.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao easily lift the bed and drag it into the hole, Jujun had the words ‘tough girl’ emerge in her head. She pondered upon it then felt that she should replace ‘girl’ with ‘female zombie’, so she should call Lin Qiao ‘tough female zombie’!</p> <p>Lin Qiao regretted after dragging the bed in.</p> <p>She had realized that she should have taken out the things in the small space first. The room inside wasn’t large, so once the bed was put in, there was no room left for anything else. And now, the entrance had been blocked by the bed, behind which were a few tanks of gas and a pile of sundries. She now needed to move out the tanks!</p> <p>The problem was that the bed was stuck!</p> <p>She stood on the bed, silently looking at the few tanks behind it. Now, she could only carry them out by going over the bed.</p> <p>Junjun stood outside the entrance and stuck her head in to see that Lin Qiao seemed not to know what to do. However, she couldn’t help her as she was holding the boy, and could only curiously observe the small space.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she wondered why Lin Qiao had a small space inside her space. Was it a double space?</p> <p>Lin Qiao carried out the things inside the small space, and went over the bed to put them outside. Then, she moved the bed further in and piled those sundries under it.</p> <p>After being done with it, she waved at Junjun, then pointed at the bed, signaling her to put the boy on it.</p> <p>Junjun immediately walked in and held the boy to the bed, bending over to put him on it gently.</p> <p>Right at that moment, the eyelids of the little boy who was just laid on the bed moved slightly, and then he opened his eyes slowly.</p> <p>That was a pair of dim and expressionless eyes. However, these eyes didn’t show any fear when the boy saw Junjun’s zombie face, but glowed slightly. And then, the boy opened his mouth to utter a sound.</p> <p>“Uh… Mommy!” The boy’s voice was weak, but he sounded to be relying heavily on Junjun.</p> <p>Junjun’s heart melted when she heard his voice. Even though she didn’t remember anyone, she would never forget that feeling. It was like that this boy was the most important thing to her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the little boy in surprise as well when she noticed that he had woken up.</p> <p>She saw that his eyes were dim and unfocused, but couldn’t detect any fear from those eyes when he looked at Junjun, whose appearance had changed.</p> <p>She then took out the paper and wrote a line. However, instead of showing that to Junjun, she directly put the piece of paper in her hand. After that, she picked up the small bowl which she gave to Junjun before, then turned and walked out of the small space.</p>",
  "Chapter 71: Eat or Not Eat": "<p>Junjun unfolded the paper to read the few lines written on it.</p> <p><em>‘I have some strawberries in my space which edible for human beings. I’ll go pick some now. And, the water that the boy drank earlier on came from the lake. It has a healing effect for the boy, as well as for zombies. You can go to the lake to fetch some water to drink. It’ll improve your body condition a lot.’</em></p> <p>As Lin Qiao went to the strawberry field and picked a few large strawberries, Wu Yueling started following her again, with the rabbit held in her arms. She didn’t know why Lin Qiao let another strange zombie in, but she saw that they had brought the little boy in as well.</p> <p>Maybe because some strangers had come to this space which used to belong to only Lin Qiao and herself, Wu Yueling felt insecure again, so she wanted to follow the former around.</p> <p>Therefore, she ran to Lin Qiao when she saw her come out of the small space and walk toward the strawberry field.</p> <p>After picking a few large strawberries and putting them in the bowl, Lin Qiao glanced at Wu Yueling, who had run up behind her, then headed to the lakeside.</p> <p>A while later, she sent the washed strawberries to the small space.</p> <p>Junjun was sitting on the bed. She fixed her eyes on the bowl which was held in Lin Qiao’s hand when she walked in. The strawberries in the bowl were exceptionally large. She couldn’t see the color of these strawberries, but she knew that they were mutant at a first glance due to their abnormally large size.</p> <p>She looked at Lin Qiao with hesitation, as she didn’t know if she should feed the boy these weird-looking fruits.</p> <p>Seeing the look in her eyes, Lin Qiao knew how she felt without needing to sense her thoughts. She pointed at Wu Yueling, who was on the outside, then wrote on the paper—’That child has been eating these the whole time. You don’t need to worry. You can also go out to see if she’s eating or not.’</p> <p>Junjun glanced at the bowl of strawberries in Lin Qiao’s hand and thought for a moment, then carried the little boy and stood up to walk out of the small space and see Wu Yueling. As Lin Qiao said, she saw that Wu Yueling was eating a strawberry.</p> <p>After that, she turned back relievedly and walked up to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>The little boy hadn’t left Junjun’s arms since he woke up. He put his arms around her neck, not seeming to mind her dirty clothes and the blood stain on her shirt at all.</p> <p>However, he was scared when he turned his head and saw Lin Qiao’s damaged face. He immediately turned back to cradle his head on Junjun’s shoulder.</p> <p>“Em…” While doing that, he began weeping, but didn’t dare to cry loudly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know what to say as she accidentally scared the boy.<br/>\n<em>‘Why’re you crying? I don’t want to look like this! This body belonged to someone else! I found myself like this when I woke up! That’s not my fault!’ She complained silently.</em></p> <p>Junjun felt a heartache once she heard the boy weep. However, she didn’t know what to do to comfort him other than simply pat him on his back.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had no other choice but to hand Junjun the bowl and walk out. But before leaving, she left Junjun another note— <em>‘You stay here for now. I’ll go out to drive. If you need me, just roar. I’ll hear you.’</em></p> <p>After reading the note, Junjun glanced at the strawberries in her hand, then at the little boy in her arms.</p> <p>She hesitated for a while, then decided to let the boy eat these strawberries. After all, she had seen the little girl eating it just now, and nothing seemed to happen to her at all.</p> <p>She gently touched the little boy, then held the bowl up to his face.</p> <p>The little boy sneakily glanced back. After finding out that Lin Qiao was no longer here, he raised his head and was attracted by the sweet aroma of the strawberries.</p> <p>Lin Qiao exited her space with Wu Yueling, then went downstairs. Those ordinary zombies hadn’t gone far, and all turned back when they smelled the kid’s scent.</p> <p>“Roar!” Lin Qiao narrowed her eyes and gave them a deep roar, her voice containing a strong warning.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s voice, those zombies automatically drew back. The timider ones turned and left instantly, but some still stayed there, eyes fixed on Wu Yueling as they seemed unwilling to give up on eating her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked down the stairs, and those zombies followed while surrounding her and Wu Yueling, reluctant to leave.</p> <p>She came down to the first floor and walked out of the iron gate toward the car which she had parked by the entrance of the building. Then, she opened the door of the front seat, prepared to put the little one into the car.</p> <p>Suddenly, a figure leaped down from the second floor of another building, swiftly darting toward her on all fours like an animal.</p> <p>She quickly turned and shielded Wu Yueling behind her legs. Right when the figure pounced on her, she swung her arm and popped her claws.</p> <p>Puff! She gripped that creature’s face with her fingers spread, and her sharp claws had sunken deep into its temples.</p> <p>“Roar!” A weird raging roar was heard from that creature in her hand. Lin Qiao grasped its head and even lifted up it up, so its toes were barely touching the ground. However, it didn’t surrender, fiercely waving its limbs and trying to scratch Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Before its roar faded, a clear puffing noise could be heard as Lin Qiao clenched her fingers and crushed the head of this zombie, which seemed to have entered level-three not long ago.</p> <p>In fact, Lin Qiao had no idea that she had such a great grip strength. She was disgusted by the stench that came from that zombie’s mouth, so she unwittingly put forth her strength through her fingers. Yet unexpectedly, she crushed its head directly.</p> <p>Thud! She dug out the nucleus in that zombie’s head with the other hand while having a look of disgust in her face, then swung her arm and threw the zombie head far away.</p> <p>Witnessing this, the other zombies which surrounded her closely all stepped back, not daring to approach again. They were probably scared by the indescribably fierce vibe that Lin Qiao generated when she crushed the zombie’s head just now.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had no idea that she just had generated a strong and dangerous vibe just now. She put the zombie nucleus on her palm, which turned into powders in the next second and drifted away.</p> <p>A faint warmth flew across her body, then returning to her brain. Nothing happened after that. Simply speaking, the energy contained in that zombie nucleus was too little for her to even sense it!</p> <p>After she finished off the zombie neatly and quickly, Lin Qiao wiped her hand on the back of her own cloth, then turned to put Wu Yueling into the car and rub her back conveniently. The girl’s body was a little stiff already.</p> <p>Judging by her glazed expression and stiff body, she was frightened by what had happened just now.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put her on the front seat, fastened the safety belt for her, then closed the car door. After that, she walked to the other side of the car, opened the door of the driver’s seat, and sat inside.</p> <p>Then she started the car, turned it around, and drove out of this housing estate. But as she prepared to leave this area, she suddenly spotted a convenience store. So, she stopped again, took Wu Yueling into the store, and collected all useful things in it before driving on.</p>",
  "Chapter 72: It’s Heading South": "<p>While Lin Qiao was driving forward, a military off-road vehicle drove onto the highway which was still guarded by the level-five zombie, then stopped before the bodies of the few robbers. Meng Yue and Wu Chengyue got off the car, looking at the three bodies; two of the three bodies were headless.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue frowned slightly, then walked to the bodies expressionlessly and began examining them one after another.</p> <p>“These people were all robbers. Judging by the stage of decomposition, they’ve been dead for three days. The heads of these two were cut off quite neatly, which doesn’t look like something zombies would do. The other one seems to have been killed by a zombie though, as his heart was dug out by claws,” he said.</p> <p>He stood before the fat man’s body with one hand before his chest and the other supporting his chin. While speaking, he pointed at the three bodies, also turning the fat man’s body over with his foot.</p> <p>At the sight of these bodies, Wu Chengyue learned what had happened to these robbers. Like the other two, the fat man had his brain eaten and stomach emptied; but the large hole on his back proved that he died when a zombie dug his heart out.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue then turned to the two headless bodies. He also saw the two heads which were thrown to the side, with no brain matter left in them.</p> <p>“They may have encountered a higher level zombie. It was probably that level-five zombie leader. But… why were they stripped?” Meng Yue looked at the three bodies which were wearing nothing but underwear and wondered.</p> <p>Did that zombie leader have a weird hobby of stripping corpses? What did that a zombie need those clothes for? None of these clothes were left on the scene.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue carefully observed the surrounded environment, then shook his head and responded, “I don’t know.”</p> <p>Then, he turned to Meng Yue and asked, “Didn’t you feel anything? Have you felt Ling Ling?”</p> <p>Meng Yue closed her eyes, then slightly raised her right hand, palm up. A tiny grass grew out of her palm and swayed slightly as if it was blown by a wind. After that, it pointed at one side of the road.</p> <p>“Didn’t it go straight? Did it take a detour?” Wu Chengyue asked, sounding a little surprised.</p> <p>Meng Yue nodded and said, “This highway is probably blocked somewhere in the front, so it took a detour. I think there’s a bridge up ahead.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue thought for a moment, then asked in confusion, “Bridge? Is that female zombie afraid of water? Why did it take a detour?”</p> <p>Meng Yue glanced at the three bodies, then turned to walk back to the vehicle and said, “I don’t know. We should just hurry up and try to catch up Ling Ling. If I’m right, that female zombie should have gone through that small town over there.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded, then turned around immediately and followed her back into the car. After sitting inside, he ordered one of his soldiers to turn the car around and head to the branch road beside the highway.</p> <p>“That female zombie seems to be moving South the whole time, as if it has a purpose,” said Meng Yue while feeling strange about it.</p> <p>After chasing that female zombie for quite some days, the two of them had discovered that it had been moving in the same direction the whole time. They found that it was heading straight south without making any turns, and had been taking the shortest ways.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue dropped his eyelids, pondering over Meng Rue’s words. “For whatever reason, it’s heading South… But, why did it take my Ling Ling with her?” He said.</p> <p>“Doesn’t matter why it took Ling Ling. We can only try our best to find it as soon as possible. After all, we don’t know what it might do to Ling Ling during this time. And, I’m afraid that she might be in a bad condition. She’s an introverted kid, and has autism… Her mental state may affect her physical condition. I’m really worried about that,” said Meng Yue.</p> <p>Hearing her, Wu Chengyue’s face darkened immediately. He had the same worry as Meng Yue the whole time. He knew his daughter well enough; he knew that she wouldn’t even let the familiar people near her. But now, she was kidnapped by an ugly female zombie. He could imagine how scared she must be right now, and was also worried that her mental state might fail to bear what was happening and cause some severe problems.</p> <p>Food was his another concern. Meng Yue could sense that the seed inside Wu Yueling’s body was still alive, meaning that Wu Yueling was still alive. But, what he worried about the most was that she might have fallen into a coma already.</p> <p>He just couldn’t imagine that that female zombie would try finding human food for his daughter. He even doubted if the zombie’s space had oxygen in it, and thought that maybe living people would stay in a coma once they entered its space.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue had been keeping these thoughts to himself and telling himself that his daughter was fine. But now, he felt depressed on hearing Meng Yue say it out, even though he had always been a calm and confident person.</p> <p>But fortunately, he had a strong mind as one of the leaders of a base. So, he soon restrained the negative thoughts in his mind.</p> <p>At least, his daughter was still alive at the moment, and that was enough!</p> <p>Seeing the depressed look in his face, Meng Yue realized that she had said the wrong words. So, she corrected herself, “It’s alright though. My grass has sensed that Ling Ling is very close to us now, so we should be able to catch up with her very soon.”</p> <p>At that moment, the soldier who was driving stopped the car suddenly, then turned back to report to Wu Chengyue, “Chief, I found something in the front.”</p> <p>“What is it?” Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue look ahead together and asked.</p> <p>The soldier pointed at the ground and said, “There’re some new wheel ruts on the road.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue opened the car door and got off the car immediately.</p> <p>The car had driven off the highway and was moving toward the small town through the branch road. They felt strange when they heard the soldier mention new wheel ruts, so they got off the car to check the road.</p> <p>The road was covered in sands and dust, and two wheel ruts were on the middle of it. Judging by these wheel ruts, that car had only left not long ago.</p> <p>“Some people drove a car into this town. Were they zombie hunters? Or robbers?” Meng Yue stared at the wheel ruts on the road while saying.</p> <p>“We’ll find out what happened when we get there. Let’s go,” Wu Chengyue glanced at the road calmly, then turned and got back in the car, Meng Yue following him inside.</p> <p>The wheel ruts they found were left by Lin Qiao’s car. No one had been in this small town since the old world ended, so the road was covered by accumulated dust and sand already.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue couldn’t have figured out at all that the one who had driven a car into the town was a zombie named Lin Qiao, because they believed that only human beings could drive. Therefore, they guessed that the ones who drove into the town were either zombie hunters or robbers.</p> <p>It couldn’t be an army from a base, because they only found the traces left by one car. With that new puzzle, they continued driving toward the town.</p>",
  "Chapter 73: Pass By A Farm": "<p>Lin Qiao hadn’t driven far before a farm came in her sight and attracted her attention.</p> <p>Maybe because of the remote location of the town, almost nobody had ever come here since the old world ended. Most of the people who lived in the town had turned into zombies, and the surviving ones had all run away. Therefore, this place was left empty.</p> <p>Earlier on, Lin Qiao had found many useful things in the store.</p> <p>The road she was driving on was located behind the town. She didn’t expect to pass by a farm; or to be precise, she didn’t think that there would be a seemingly large farm behind the town.</p> <p>She parked the car by the roadside, then stuck her head out to look at the vast expanse of green plants, even though the whole world was black and white in her eyes.</p> <p>Many vegetable plastic greenhouses were still present on the farm. They were abandoned long ago, so most of the plastic clothes on these greenhouses were gone, leaving the frames standing there.</p> <p>However, many vegetables were still growing under these frames disorderedly. The vegetables in each greenhouse were of one variety, and a total of about two acres of land in the farm was used for growing vegetables.</p> <p>At a glance, Lin Qiao found the plants of all kinds of beans, potatoes, peanuts, and all sorts of melons; but sadly, over ninety percent of them seemed to have mutated.</p> <p>She couldn’t see colors, but could feel the virus inside these plants. She was now not only able to sense the energy of the lake water, but was also able to sensitively feel many other things. That might have something to do with what happened to her down in the lake, but she couldn’t tell for sure.</p> <p>She got off the car and sent the Wu Yueling into her space, then brought Junjun out of the small space.</p> <p>She had made a rule for Junjun—she needed to come out of the space while Wu Yueling was in there, and if she wanted to get in, Lin Qiao would bring the little girl out.</p> <p>At that point, Junjun trusted Lin Qiao more than before, so she left the little boy in the space without worrying too much, and came out along with the latter.</p> <p>Once out, she found that they were standing by a roadside, facing a farm. In her eyes, the world was still colorless</p> <p>She glanced at Lin Qiao in confusion, then the latter gave her a note.</p> <p><em>‘Stay here. I’ll go down to take a look. You be careful in here. If any human being shows up, you should hide or find me.’</em></p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao leaped into the vegetable field. The field hadn’t been taken care of for long, so it was overgrown with weeds, looking very waste.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao arrived here, the thing she caught the first with her sharp eyes was the orchard on a hill on the other side. Only after that did she find the vegetable field down here.</p> <p>She was attracted by these vegetables because she suddenly wanted to see if there were still some edible vegetables which hadn’t mutated yet.</p> <p>She now had two living human beings in her space, and not just a single one. She couldn’t feed them both with nothing but strawberries, could she?</p> <p>Most importantly, she sensed the scent of something edible for her from the orchard, meaning some kind of animal was in there!</p> <p>After eating a mouse and a rabbit the last time, she hadn’t eaten anything for a long time. Even though the lack of food wouldn’t do much harm to her body, she always felt her teeth itchy, throat dry, and stomach grumbling, because she was staying with Wu Yueling all day.</p> <p>She wanted to eat meat!</p> <p>She glanced at the vegetables and weeds under her feet after stepping into the field. Walking for a while, she found some tangled vines covering the ground, but most of them carried the virus.</p> <p>She squatted to look at the pumpkins on the vines. The melons were gray in her eyes. Then, she turned back and glanced at the vines and leaves. The leaves were gray as well, but the vines were black, tinged with a weird purple color.</p> <p>She knew that the strange purple color she saw was the virus itself.</p> <p>She couldn’t see the virus before, but now she could.</p> <p>Except for the bright green color of the energy contained in the lake water, she could now see another color which living human beings couldn’t see.</p> <p>What made her feel strange was that both the pumpkins and the leaves were free from the virus, and the virus was concentrated in the vines.</p> <p>Why did that happen?</p> <p>Looking at the weird-looking large pumpkin in front of her, Lin Qiao scratched it with her claws.</p> <p>The size of the pumpkin was the same as that of normal pumpkins in the old world. What made it different from the normal pumpkins was the awfully twisted stripes on its skin.</p> <p>Lin Qiao touched the pumpkin with both hands, then confirmed that it was free from the virus. It just looked weird because of the stripes on its skin, seeming to form a twisted human face! No human being would dare to touch this pumpkin, because ‘don’t touch strange mutant plants’ had become a common sense since the old world ended.</p> <p>The survivors in the post-apocalyptic world wouldn’t touch any plant unless they wanted to be affected by the zombie virus.</p> <p>Lin Qiao too felt that the plants in this post-apocalyptic world were strange. The ones which looked completely abnormal and mutant-like were actually non-poisonous, such as the strawberries in her space. And this pumpkin in front of her was mutant indeed, but the virus was contained in its vines instead of its fruits; which meant it was safe for healthy human beings as long as they didn’t touch its vines.</p> <p>At the same time, some plants looked normal, but weren’t.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the hairy gourd plant next to her and found that it looked quite normal. She couldn’t see its color, but it was of a normal shape at least. However, Lin Qiao had sensed a metallic scent from its fruits.</p> <p>She didn’t know how would that metallic scent affect human beings, but she saw that it was emitted from the virus inside the plant.</p> <p>After glancing at the surrounding plants, Lin Qiao stood up and gently raised a foot, walking toward the orchard quietly. She had decided to fill her stomach first, then come back to study these vegetables and fruits.</p> <p>Two types of trees were planted in the orchard: peaches and pears. The orchard was large, but most of the trees in it were mutant, rich in the virus.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sniffed at these trees. Their scent wasn’t pleasant, but wasn’t repulsive to her either, probably because she too had the virus inside her body.</p> <p>Apart from the scent of the trees, she had also sensed something else from deep in the orchard. It was a sweet aroma which boosted her sense of hunger.</p> <p>She followed the aroma which attracted her, quietly walking toward its source. She might have automatically begun to prepare for the hunting, as she instinctively restrained her vibe and gently moved toward the source of the aroma like a cat, without making any sound.</p>",
  "Chapter 74: The Giant Snake": "<p>When Lin Qiao moved closer and closer toward the source of the aroma, she suddenly sensed a strange scent which was like a strong smell of fish. She turned to look around, and just as she did that, she realized that the aroma she had been following was gone.</p> <p>She narrowed her eyes and stopped moving, because she felt that she was targeted by something. She couldn’t tell if the thing with the fishy smell had scared her prey away, or if the aroma was only a bait for luring her.</p> <p>She stayed where she was, silently sensing the surrounding environment.</p> <p>It was the noon as she stood in the middle of the pear orchard, surrounded by thriving pear trees. The ground was covered by grasses; a breeze blew across, rustling the leaves.</p> <p>At that moment, her feet sensed a very slight vibration. Human beings wouldn’t be able to sense that vibration, but she was no longer a human being.</p> <p>She didn’t turn back, but remained calm while looking at the front. She even casually glanced around, as if she was confused and was looking for something in front of her. However, her attention was concentrated on the area behind her.</p> <p>She felt that the slight vibration was coming closer and closer to her, and was quite strange. It wasn’t coming in waves, but seemed to be caused by constant friction; as if someone was towing a long rope forward by holding one of its ends.</p> <p>Thinking of that fishy smell, Lin Qiao felt that she knew what was coming at her.</p> <p>When that vibration stopped, Lin Qiao suddenly turned back her head and popped her claws. She swung her shiny claws backward and turned her body around in the meanwhile, then swiftly leaped backward.</p> <p>Apparently, she had made the right move. When she turned around and drew back, she saw a snake coiling on the pear tree which she swung her claws toward.</p> <p>That snake was huge, even thicker than the thighs of an adult human being. It coiled on the pear tree, nearly wrapping the entire tree with its body. Fortunately, the mutant pear tree was tall and strong, not as fragile as the normal ones. So, it managed to support this giant snake without breaking.</p> <p>Hiss!</p> <p>The snake had been reaching its head toward Lin Qiao. As she suddenly turned back and attacked, it didn’t manage to dodge, but let her sharp claws leave three slashes on its head.</p> <p>However, its skin was incredibly strong! Lin Qiao was able to cut off trees and zombie heads easily, but the harm that her claws did to the snake on its head wasn’t so bad.</p> <p>Being clawed on the head, the snake immediately screeched in pain. Then, it suddenly tightened its body which was coiled on the pear tree and began twisting intensively.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! What has this snake been fed?’ </em>Lin Qiao thought as she focused on the danger ahead of her. She couldn’t tell exactly how long this snake was, because it had wrapped countless coils around the tree; but its tail still reached the ground.</p> <p>She couldn’t tell what kind of snake it was either. It was entirely black, looking a little like a cobra, and its scales had a metallic luster. However, cobras were very rare in Sea City, and the commonly seen snakes in this area were vipers and rat snakes.</p> <p><em>‘What kind of snake is it?’ </em>Lin Qiao wondered.</p> <p>Anyway, whatever snake it was, it was one pissed off snake at that moment.</p> <p>One of its eyelids were cut by Lin Qiao’s claws and was bleeding, but its eyes weren’t hurt. Right now, its eyes were fixed with coldness and anger, fixed squarely on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>It was the king of this region. Because of its giant size, great strength, fast speed, and strong skin, the other animals weren’t able to hurt it. But now, it was wounded by Lin Qiao, who was just a prey in its eyes. And the prey had actually hurt it so badly! No wonder it got so infuriated!</p> <p>Lin Qiao paused briefly after sensing the scent of the snake’s blood. She raised her head to carefully sniff it, and then was cheered up.</p> <p>It smelled nice! Just now, she merely caught a strong fishy smell, but after sensing the smell of the snake’s blood, she felt eager to drink it!</p> <p>Looking at the extra long snake, Lin Qiao’s lips curved into a happy smile. She gazed at the snake as if it were a huge meal. She even felt like drooling, like the zombies which had spotted living human beings.</p> <p>The snake became even more furious as its prey suddenly began to stare at it like it was some kind of food. It tightened its body on the pear tree and raised its head high to look down at Lin Qiao in anger, then widely opened its jaws and let out its fork tongue, exposing its pair of large and sharp fangs.</p> <p>After that, it suddenly dove down from the tree and pounced on Lin Qiao who was four or five meters away. It nimbly slid off the tree as it widened its mouth to bite Lin Qiao’s head.</p> <p>Despite its giant size, this snake was incredibly fast. Within a blink, it had darted up to Lin Qiao from the tree.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that her eyes were dazzled. Before she could see what happened clearly, she sensed a strong wind blowing in her face along with a strong scent of blood.</p> <p>She instinctively leaped aside, agilely turned around. Meanwhile, she swung her claws toward the snake’s head as hard as she could.</p> <p>Squeak!</p> <p>An ear-piercing noise was heard.</p> <p>Next, she felt that her claws had hit against an aluminum-alloy-like surface and went numb.</p> <p>Hiss!</p> <p>The snaked hissed in pain again. Apparently, it had suffered even worse this time.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quickly stepped back. When she fixed her eyes on the snake again, she saw that it had fallen on the ground, coiled up and twisting intensively. She gave a closer look at the snake and found that she had managed to wound its head once again, on the same side which she had attacked the last time.</p> <p>While watching the snake struggling on the ground, Lin Qiao took another step backward silently. She did that for no other reason but to avoid being hit by its tail.</p> <p>The snake twitched intensely. Its tail even whipped at quite a few surrounding trees and broke them, also leaving a series of traces on the grass.</p> <p>The snake seemed to be in a real pain! Lin Qiao said ‘sorry’ in her head, and then wondered if she had lost her mind. ‘Why the hell should I be sorry?’</p> <p>At that point, the giant snake gradually quieted down. Its body, which was about ten-meters-long, slowly coiled up. It buried its head in its coiled body without daring to raise it high, only showing its pair of cold and sharp eyes to stare at Lin Qiao angrily and carefully.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed the strong murderous intent and vigilance in its eyes. She knew that just now, the snake believed that it was definitely able to bite her. However, it didn’t expect her to be so fast, or to hurt its head.</p> <p>Therefore, the snake didn’t dare to be careless again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao flicked her claws which were still numb, then flexed her fingers. She didn’t think that the snake’s head would be so tough. Judging by the noise caused when her claws hit against the snake’s head, she estimated that even a normal shotgun wouldn’t be able to shoot bullets into its head.</p>",
  "Chapter 75: The Car By the Roadside": "<p>While Lin Qiao was fighting the giant snake, the ears of Junjun, who was waiting by the roadside, suddenly moved. She heard a faint sound of a car, so she turned her head to look at the other side of the road.</p> <p>She didn’t forget that she had already become a zombie, and hence was instinctively vigilant against human beings.</p> <p>Soon afterward, she went down to the vegetable field from behind Lin Qiao’s car, then ran away with large steps in the direction which Lin Qiao took earlier on. She couldn’t run smoothly, stumbling all the way because her legs weren’t flexible enough. But fortunately, she was still able to run, just not as fast as she wanted.</p> <p>A few minutes later, a military off-road car showed up at the end of the road behind, and soon came to where Lin Qiao’s car was parked.</p> <p>The car was parked next to Lin Qiao’s car. Then, Wu Chengyue, Meng Yue, and the soldier who had been driving the car came out of it. They surrounded Lin Qiao’s car and spent a short while observing it, then turned to the farm by the roadside.</p> <p>“So, there are some crops and an orchard. Hasn’t anyone come to this area before?” Meng Yue looked at the disordered vegetables in the filed in surprise and said. While speaking, she let out the tiny grass in her palm again, then reached her hand toward the field and closed her eyes to feel something.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at Lin Qiao’s car, then looked at the vegetable field and the orchard on the hill at a distance, remaining silent.</p> <p>The soldier beside him gazed at the orchard and said, “Why did the owner of this car park here? To search for food in this farm? But, the crops here are clearly infected and inedible. And, that orchard is a very dangerous place. How dare they go in there? Aren’t they afraid that they may not have a chance to come back alive?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stared at the orchard for a while as well, then said, “Some things are fighting in there… Should be mutant animals.”</p> <p>Speaking of mutant animals, all three of them wore a serious look.</p> <p>Meng Yue nodded and said, “I felt it. A Level-four mutant beast, highly dangerous. But, it’s no match for you. And, it’s normal for mutant beasts to exist here, as this place is near a mountain area.”</p> <p>They were currently located on the edge of Sea City. If they kept moving for a short distance, they would enter Zhe Province. Therefore, this area was surrounded by mountains, and so was the small town that they passed by earlier.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded in response. Mutant beasts weren’t the only dangerous creatures in mountain areas. The most dangerous things in mountains and woods areas were those unpredictable mutant plants.</p> <p>Meng Yue glanced at the grass in her palm and then said, “All plants in this area are infected already, and none is edible. If the people who own this car have entered that orchard, I doubt they can find any food. And, apart from mutant beasts, I think a high-level zombie is also in the orchard.”</p> <p>She knitted her brows, as the orchard had been giving her a strong sense of danger, making her feel a little uneasy.</p> <p>She understood that that feeling was given to her by the mutant plants and animals in that area.</p> <p>She possessed botanical power, but her power couldn’t be used for launching fierce attacks. Instead, her power enabled her to be extra sensitive to the plants around her, and grow plants fast. She was also an excellent tracker.</p> <p>Fortunately, she herself had some fighting capacity; adding her sensitiveness to her surrounding environments, she wasn’t weak at all. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be carrying missions together with Wu Chengyue and the other soldiers all the time.</p> <p>Suddenly, she fixed her eyes on the grass in her palm, and then the look in her face turned serious. After that, she raised her head to stare at the part of the orchard which had been giving her that strong sense of danger, trying to feel something very carefully.</p> <p>Discovering her move, Wu Chengyue focused his attention on her face.</p> <p>“What? Is anything happening in there?” He asked.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue wasn’t going to enter that orchard, because that place was way too dangerous. As he needed to catch up with his daughter as quickly as possible, he didn’t want to waste his time in this place. However, when he saw Lin Qiao’s car, his judgment made him stop.</p> <p>He believed that if the people who owned the car had entered the orchard not long ago, they should have run out in a panic by now. Otherwise, the two creatures in the orchard wouldn’t be so concentrating on fighting each other, and would try catching the preys first.</p> <p>Meng Yue opened her eyes and said with a serious look, “I felt it! Ling Ling is in the orchard! If I guessed right, the weird female zombie should be there as well.”</p> <p>While speaking, she raised her hand to point at where Lin Qiao was.</p> <p>Hearing her words, the look in Wu Chengyue’s face changed slightly. He stared at that direction expressionlessly and asked, “Are you sure?”</p> <p>Meng Yue nodded affirmatively and responded with, “My feelings can’t be wrong! Let’s go in and take a look first. I think it might be the one which is fighting that mutant beast now!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue darted out from beside Mengyue and went down into the field without waiting for her to finish her words. Within a blink, he had crossed the field and rushed into the orchard.</p> <p>“Licheng, you wait here,” Meng Yue hurriedly gave an order to the soldier, then nimbly leaped into the vegetable field and followed Wu Chengyue into the orchard.</p> <p>“Yue, be careful!” The soldier whose name was Xiao Licheng shouted at Meng Yue, as he was a little worried about her.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was powerful, but unlike him, Meng Yue wasn’t a strong fighter. So, it was still too dangerous for her to run into the orchard now. But fortunately, because of her botanical power, the mutant plants wouldn’t attack her.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched the giant snake coil up and felt that it looked like a giant pile of poo… or, like an iron tower. It was posing for both offense and defense, as it was now able to defend itself easily, or reach out its head to attack the enemy.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood about five meters away from the snake in a lunge position, legs bent slightly and claws before her chest, preparing to attack.</p> <p>After watching the snake recover quickly from the pain, she understood that she now needed to focus all her attention in dealing with it.</p> <p>The snake had its head buried in its coiled body for a while, then slowly raised it, staring at Lin Qiao coldly. The wounds on its head had stopped bleeding already.</p> <p>Lin Qiao again sensed the scent of the snake’s blood. It was a mixture of a fishy smell and a thick sweet aroma, and was making her feel more and more hungry.</p> <p>When the snake slowly raised its head, Lin Qiao narrowed her eyes. She fixed those pitch-dark eyes on the triangular snakehead which was as big as the head of a human baby.</p> <p>Suddenly, the snake lunged its head at Lin Qiao and uncoiled its body momentarily. It moved incredibly fast, pouncing on her along with a gust of fishy-smelled wind.</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted immediately. She didn’t step back, but rushed directly at the snake.</p> <p>Snakes weren’t able to move in a straight line, but could only wriggle. Therefore, the prey might have relatively larger chance of survival if they fled in a straight route.</p>",
  "Chapter 76: Fierce Battle Against The Giant Snake": "<p>Seeing Lin Qiao charge at it, the snake immediately felt provoked. It gave a start, then showed ferocity in its eyes as it suddenly turned to the side and took a half circle. Right when it turned its head around, Lin Qiao darted up to it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was going to attack the snake on the head, but to her surprise, the latter was quite smart. It actually came around and reached its mouth to her back.</p> <p>Under the urgent situation, she only had the time to swing her claws at the snake’s strong body before leaping away as soon as possible.</p> <p>Clang!</p> <p>Another sharp metallic sound was heard.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s claws were sharp and strong, but the snake’s scales on its body were even thicker and stronger than that on its head. Therefore, she only managed to leave a few white marks on its body without even breaking its skin!</p> <p>On the contrary, her hands were numbed because of the collision.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Why is it so tough? How should I fight it then?’ </em>As her attack failed to deliver any effect to the snake, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but complain silently.</p> <p>Her only choice was to attack the snakehead now. However, after suffering two strikes, the snake had smartly learned to protect its head already. It kept its head away from Lin Qiao while using its body as a weapon.</p> <p>As she had expected, the snake fiercely charged at her once it found that her attack failed to harm it, and that she was drawing back.</p> <p>Now, the snake intended to coil around Lin Qiao and then tighten its body as hard as possible!</p> <p>Lin Qiao caught a sense of danger which sent shivers down her spine once she began drawing back. So, she immediately said ‘in’ silently, and then vanished into thin air.</p> <p>Hiss?</p> <p>The snake missed its target and threw itself to the ground. It paused shortly in confusion, then quickly raised its head and took a few circles around the spot where Lin Qiao disappeared from.</p> <p>It looked around for a few times, but still couldn’t find a trace of its prey.</p> <p>If it hadn’t watched her disappear right in front of it, it would have thought that something was wrong with its eyes.</p> <p>While the snake was looking around to search for Lin Qiao, a transparent figure came out of thin air. However, the snake didn’t sense the vibe of the figure, neither did see it.</p> <p>The snake could not see the transparent Lin Qiao, as if it had gone blind.</p> <p>In fact, this snake didn’t feed on zombies. It chased a coyote to this area, and that was why it showed up here; the coyote was mutant as well. It was turned into a coyote-like creature, which liked to live in mountain areas, from a Chinese rural dog.</p> <p>The snake had been starved for days. After spotting the coyote, the snake had been following it the whole time, waiting for an opportunity to swallow it. But today, when it chased the coyote to this orchard, a zombie suddenly showed up.</p> <p>The scent of this zombie was a little different from that of the others. This zombie smelled nice to the snake, like something edible! Therefore, the snake forgot about that small coyote right way and cast its eyes on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>However, eating Lin Qiao was harder than the snake had imagined!</p> <p>Not only was it wounded by her claws, but it also watched her vanish before its eyes. After suffering two claw strikes and witnessing the disappearance of its prey, the giant snake was furious.</p> <p>While the snake reacted with fury to what happened, the transparent figure silently walked up behind its head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly stood behind the giant snake. At that moment, she seemed to be weightless, so the snake failed to sense her approach through the ground.</p> <p>She stood behind the snake, then quickly entered her space and came back out within a blink. Meanwhile, she swung both claws strongly toward the snake’s head.</p> <p>Hiss!</p> <p>The giant snake suddenly sensed Lin Qiao’s vibe behind its head. Before it could react, it felt a sharp pain from its head. It didn’t see anything when it turned its head around, but the pain from its head was real.</p> <p>Lin Qiao re-entered her space after she launched the claw attack. So, the snake didn’t see her when it turned back to see what had happened after suffering the pain.</p> <p>Failing to find even a trace of hers, the snake began struggling on the ground once again because of the pain as the wounds on its head had worsened.</p> <p>After all, Lin Qiao had aimed precisely at the wounds which she had caused on the snake’s head earlier on. As she had learned how to turn herself invisible by using her space, she aimed at the snake’s head and then happily launched the attack.</p> <p>So now, the giant snake was madly twisting its body in the orchard, wriggling all over the ground and breaking the surrounding plants and rocks, sending them flying away. Sand and dust were stirred up in clouds, with rock pieces flying all over the sky. The snake’s head was covered in blood as the transparent figure had been showing up from time to time, cutting at its head with sharp claws nimbly, swiftly, and fiercely.</p> <p>In a couple of minutes, the giant snake gradually slowed down.</p> <p>It was dying actually. Soon, it lay weakly on the ground, unable to move. Its body was twisted, stomach facing the sky; but, it couldn’t do anything about it. Its head was badly mutilated, and eyes blinded. Blood gushed out of its body, covering the ground, grasses, trees, and rocks around it.</p> <p>The invisible Lin Qiao stayed around the snake. Sensing its vibe fading quickly, she knew that it was dying.</p> <p>She didn’t show her face. Instead, she remained invisible and kept observing the snake. Only when the snake’s vibe disappeared completely did she make herself visible and then came out of her space.</p> <p>She kicked the snake on its head and found that its body was already soft, and could no longer make any response. After that, she squatted and wiped her claws on her cloth, then dipped her fingers into the snake blood on its head and put them in her mouth.</p> <p>A sweet and salty flavor spread in her mouth, mixed with a faint fishy taste. Lin Qiao smacked her lips as she felt that the snake’s blood tasted not bad. It wasn’t delicious, but in comparison with fruit juices, it was already good enough.</p> <p>After tasting the snake blood, she immediately wanted to take a bucket out of her space to hold it. However, as she prepared to bleed the snake, she slowly turned around and stared at front with cold eyes.</p> <p>Two people were standing at a short distance, looking at her curiously.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to scold these two people once she saw them.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Does this man have a dog’s nose?’ </em>Lin Qiao didn’t understand how Wu Chengyue managed to chase her to this place. She knew that that level-five zombie was probably following her vibe, but couldn’t figure out how had Wu Chengyue been tracking her.</p> <p>And, these two people showed up right after she dealt with her prey; neither too late, nor too early. What a coincidence!</p> <p>While thinking, Lin Qiao suddenly moved her hand, and then the over-ten-meter long snake disappeared.</p> <p>After that, she stood up and looked at the two people expressionlessly.</p> <p>Meng Yue and Wu Chengyue had looked at her silently as well, not seeming to want to move immediately.</p>",
  "Chapter 77: The Writing Zombie": "<p>In fact, Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue had just arrived. Once they got here, they saw the familiar female zombie dip her claws into the snake blood and then put into her mouth. It wasn’t a beautiful scene, but was definitely a little weird.</p> <p>Both of them were quietly observing the zombie, which soon discovered them even though they had restrained their vibes as much as they could. Wu Chengyue was powerful, so once he restrained his vibe, almost no zombies and superpowered human beings who were weaker than him could sense his presence. Unlike him, Meng Yue used a special way to hide her vibe. She merged it with the vibes of the surrounding plants, as if she was hiding her own vibes among that of plants. Therefore, it was pretty difficult for anyone to sense her vibe now.</p> <p>At that point, not even a level-six zombie or superpowered human being could sense Meng Yue’s vibe easily.</p> <p>Lin Qiao became alert the moment she saw these two people. She stared at Wu Chengyue, her eyes filled with fear, hatred, and vigilance. She was worried that this man might suddenly strike her with lightning again without saying anything.</p> <p>Even though Lin Qiao’s eyes were purely black, Wu Chengyue still felt her strong hatred toward himself hiding under her calm expression.</p> <p>Meng Yue looked at Wu Chengyue, then at Lin Qiao in confusion. After finding that Lin Qiao was merely alert toward them without showing the obvious aggressiveness and ferocity that the other high-level zombies would show at the sight of them, she started observing her with curiosity.</p> <p>Last time, this female zombie disappeared before she could see her face clearly. But now, after giving a close look, she found that this zombie was truly ugly.</p> <p>And, the zombie had actually changed her clothes. She was now wearing a training suit which looked like men’s wear. Her burnt hair were unbrushed, covering her face. Her face under the hair was barely visible, but Meng Yue still saw the large scars on her face.</p> <p>Looking at Lin Qiao’s hair and realizing that it was burnt by Wu Chengyue’s lightning, Meng Yue wanted to laugh. ‘Look at her expression. She must want to hit Chief back with lightning too to vent her anger!’</p> <p>After witnessing Lin Qiao make that ridiculously large snake disappear within a blink, Meng Yue and Wu Chengyue now confirmed that she was a space-powered zombie.</p> <p>Judging by the size of that snake, Meng Yue felt that it was quite powerful. She glanced around at the traces it caused, learning how strong it truly was.</p> <p>However, the space-powered zombie had no wounds on her body. Not to mention wounds, even her clothes were perfectly undamaged, as if she hadn’t suffered any attack at all.</p> <p>Lin Qiao remained silent and moveless, and so did Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue. They simply stood seven or eight meters away from each other, quietly staring at each other.</p> <p>In fact, it was very easy for Lin Qiao to run away now. After all, it would only take her a moment to enter her space, and Wu Chengyue couldn’t be faster than her, no matter how fast he could be. However, at that moment she was thinking about the little one, Junjun, and her son.</p> <p>Since the little one’s father had found her, she thought that it would be alright for her to just give the kid back to him. That was his child anyway. She took the girl because she was angry earlier, and also because she was too lazy to send her back, as doing that would cost her time and energy. But now, her anger had calmed as she had already taken the child so far away. However, she still wanted an apology from Wu Chengyue. She couldn’t let him strike her with lightning and pay no price for it, could she? She was nicely sending his child back to him; but instead of being grateful to her, he actually struck her with lightning! He had to apologize to her!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gazed at the zombie for a while, also feeling very strange.</p> <p><em>‘Does this female zombie actually know how to change clothes? Where’s the ugly and dirty dress she wore the last time? Since when have zombies learned to care about their appearances? They’re supposed to be indifferent to that!’ </em>He thought.</p> <p>He also felt that the female zombie was still angry at him because he struck her with lightning last time!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was a patient man, so he was observing Lin Qiao curiously at that moment. Meng Yue felt that Lin Qiao was an interesting zombie too, so she was silently observing her as well.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao wasn’t a patient zombie. She was waiting for Wu Chenyue and Meng Yue to say something, but they didn’t. She waited for three seconds… five seconds… then ten seconds; yet, neither of the two said anything.</p> <p>She wondered why the two kept staring at her without saying a word or attacking. She couldn’t sense their thoughts, so she felt that the atmosphere had begun turning a little weird.</p> <p>At last, the impatient zombie suddenly raised a hand. A notebook and a pen appeared in her hand. Then, she began writing, and the two in front of her widened their eyes and gazed at her in disbelief.</p> <p>Watching Lin Qiao writing with a pen like a human being, Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue were deeply stunned. At that moment, they really needed someone to tell them if what they saw was real or not.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue unwittingly looked out of his eye corner at Meng Yue, who sensed his gaze and glanced back at him. Neither of them seemed to believe what they had seen.</p> <p><em>‘The zombie is writing! That zombie in front of us was writing! Since when have zombies become so smart that they can actually write?’ </em></p> <p>While Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue were silently communicating through eyes, Lin Qiao finished writing. She ripped the piece of paper off from the notebook, then put the notebook and the pen into her pocket. After that, she slowly squatted, picked up a small piece of stone and wrapped it with the paper. Then, she wadded the paper up.</p> <p>Next, she threw the wad of paper at Wu Chengyue’s face, who caught the wad of paper thrown at his face, feeling speechless.</p> <p>Meng Yue, who watched that happen, shared the same feeling with him.</p> <p>“Open it!” From what she had observed, she learned that Lin Qiao was different from other zombies. She looked weird, but really didn’t have any intent of killing toward her or Wu Chengyue. And just now, the zombie wrote something with a pen, which was unbelievable.</p> <p>She really wanted to know what Lin Qiao had written on the paper. However, Wu Chengyue paused in astonishment after catching the wad of paper. Seeing that, Meng Yue couldn’t help but urge him out of curiosity.</p> <p>After that, he silently unwrapped the paper and threw the stone away. Meng Yue leaned over and saw a few lines on the paper written with clear handwriting.</p> <p><em>‘Does striking people with lightning feel nice? Apologize! Or, you won’t see the little one again! You won’t be able to do anything to me if I don’t let you see her! Apologize!’</em></p> <p>Wu Chengyue was again speechless.</p> <p>“Ha…” Meng Yue couldn’t help but laugh when she read the first line. She was holding such a deep grudge!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue fell in silence as he found that it a little difficult for him to process what was happening. Earlier on, he met a zombie which acted like a human being, and he accidentally struck her with lightning. And now, the zombie actually wanted his apology!</p> <p><em>‘What the hell? A zombie which can write and ask for an apology? And… it’s threatening me! When did zombies become so much like human beings?’ </em>He just couldn’t understand.</p> <p>“It’s threatening you! But, its handwriting is pretty!” Meng Yue said smilingly.</p> <p>After reading the note, Wu Chengyue looked at the zombie in front of him, which had a barely visible face, then asked Meng Yue, “Do you think she can understand what we said?”</p> <p>Hearing his words, both Meng Yue and Lin Qiao rolled their eyes. But of course, their eye-rolling wasn’t the same.</p> <p>Meng Yue rolled her eyes like any normal human being would do, while Lin Qiao simply raised her head to glance at the sky.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue went speechless once again, feeling despised.</p>",
  "Chapter 78: The Reunion of Father and Daughter": "<p>Wu Chengyue couldn’t even describe the feelings he had at that moment. He was despised by a zombie which looked quite smart. Even though he couldn’t see the zombie roll her eyes, the disdainful look on her face was pretty obvious.</p> <p>Soon, he too realized that the question he asked was a little silly, as both Meng Yue and the female zombie had rolled their eyes at him. The zombie was even able to write, so how could it possibly not understand what he had said? She wasn’t deaf after all!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue couldn’t understand how this female zombie became like this. After all, except for her scary appearance and the fact that she couldn’t talk, she was exactly like a human being.</p> <p>“Can you… let us see Ling Ling?” Meng Yue looked at Lin Qiao and asked suddenly; her tone was quite polite. She asked the question because she found that Wu Chengyue was already stunned by the zombie, even forgetting what he was here for.</p> <p>Hearing Meng Yue, Wu Chengyue came back to his senses. He now realized that he was in a trance just now, because the zombie had shocked him so badly. On hearing Meng Yue mention Wu Yueling, he hurriedly fixed his eyes on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded. However, she focused her eyes on Wu Chengyue after glancing at Meng Yue, without making any other move.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue immediately understood her meaning—’This man hasn’t apologized, so you can’t see the girl. I can let you see her, but you need to apologize first!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao glared at Wu Chengyue with a grumpy look.</p> <p>She was kindly sending the little one back to her father, but the girl’s father didn’t see her as a kind zombie. On the contrary, he struck her with lightning for no reason. Anyone would feel wronged under the same circumstances!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue now recalled that last time when he attacked Lin Qiao without thinking. His attack didn’t kill the zombie, but it must have made her suffer. No wonder the zombie looked so angry now.</p> <p>Imagining being attacked like that, he felt not good either!</p> <p>As all sorts of thoughts emerged in his mind, Wu Chengyue realized that he should apologize indeed. After all, the zombie didn’t do anything during their first encounter, even though she was a zombie.</p> <p>However, apologizing to a zombie sounded way too weird!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and his people believed that zombies should all be destroyed. In their eyes, zombies were like beasts, and were nothing like human beings. So, what was happening now was like he had accidentally hurt an animal, and then the animal came back to ask for an apology! Wasn’t that weird?</p> <p>But, the problem was that he did do the wrong thing; and if he refused to apologize, the zombie wouldn’t let him see his daughter! So, how could he not apologize?</p> <p>Meng Yue glanced at Wu Chengyue. Seeing the struggling look in his face, she couldn’t help but giggle and say, “Just apologize! You did attack her, didn’t you? Perhaps, she was going to send Ling Ling back to you that day, yet you attacked her and made her run!”</p> <p>While finishing her words, Meng Yue couldn’t help but glance at Lin Qiao. Then, she saw the zombie nod.</p> <p>Meng Yue was stunned.</p> <p><em>‘No way! I was just saying! Did she really try to send Ling Ling back that day?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao crossed her arms before her chest, quietly looking at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Being stared by her, Wu Chengyue somehow felt a sense of guilt. He coughed, then looked at Lin Qiao and said, “Eh-hem… Um… I’m sorry! That day I… made a mistake! So, I’m really sorry.”</p> <p>While speaking, he looked at Lin Qiao sincerely and apologetically. He thought that the female zombie wouldn’t forgive him so soon even if he said that. He felt that sometimes women could really be narrow-minded.</p> <p>However, to his surprise, the female zombie nodded once he finished talking.</p> <p><em>‘This… Just like that?’ </em>He turned to look at Meng Yue to confirm with her, who smilingly nodded at him.</p> <p>Then, Wu Chengyue turned his head to look at Ling Qiao. He saw the zombie had thrown a glance at him and then disappeared without a trace. <em>‘That’s more like it,’ </em>said the zombie with her eyes before disappearing.</p> <p>He didn’t know why he was able to read the meaning in the zombie’s eyes. The zombie’s expressions were way too human-like, and he found that a little unacceptable!</p> <p>In a few seconds, two figures came out of thin air, showing up where Lin Qiao had disappeared just now.</p> <p>“Ling Ling!” Both Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue shouted out loud at the sight of the little girl by Lin Qiao’s side.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave a closer look at his daughter, finding that she looked quite energetic, and her face was clean. She was still wearing the same clothes that she wore when she went missing, but those clothes weren’t dirty.</p> <p>Seeing that his daughter had been taken good care of, he finally stopped worrying.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was a little confused when Lin Qiao brought her out, but she remained expressionless as always. However, when she turned her head to see Wu Chengyue, her eyes glowed and then turned slightly red.</p> <p>‘Daddy!’</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s heart softened when he saw the familiar look in his daughter’s widely opened eyes. He couldn’t help but make two steps forward, but stopped right after that and glanced at Lin Qiao with hesitation.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao was quietly watching the reunion of the father and the daughter, her arms crossed before her chest. She made no move when Wu Chengyue suddenly looked at her.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, Wu Yueling made some reaction when she saw that her dad was looking at the zombie. She ran up to Lin Qiao, then shook her head toward Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>She didn’t say anything, but Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue both understood her meaning: she was afraid that he might attack Lin Qiao. She knew that Lin Qiao was a zombie, and she often saw him attack zombies.</p> <p>She was young and introverted, and never liked to talk; but, she was also very sensitive and smart.</p> <p>Standing behind Wu Yueling, Lin Qiao sensed that the kid wanted to protect her. She looked at girl’s little body, feeling her metaphorical heart warm up.</p> <p>She reached out a hand and gently rubbed Wu Yueling’s head, then pushed her toward Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Wu Yueling turned back to look at Lin Qiao. Clearly, she knew what the zombie meant. She held the little gray rabbit and glanced at the latter again, then turned back to walk toward Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>However, after making two steps, she suddenly stopped and again turned back toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, come to Daddy,” Wu Chegyue squatted to look at Wu Yueling in the eyes while gently waving at her.</p> <p>Hearing her dad calling her, Wu Yueling immediately walked toward him. However, when she was halfway toward her dad, the little rabbit suddenly leaped out of her arms to the ground.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was startled, thinking that her rabbit friend was running away. However, when she turned to look at it, she found that the rabbit had run back to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>She paused briefly, then turned back to chase the rabbit.</p> <p>“Ling Ling! Come here!” Seeing that Wu Yueling seemed to run back to the female zombie, Meng Yue shouted out.</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Chengyue moved swiftly. He showed up beside Wu Yueling within a blink, then scooped her up.</p>",
  "Chapter 79: The Potential Risk of Leaving": "<p>“Good girl, daddy will get you another one when we’re home,” After scooping Wu Yueling up, Wu Chengyue glanced at the little grey rabbit which had already bounced to Lin Qiao’s feet, then said to his daughter.</p> <p>However, Wu Yueling shook her head, and her eyes were still fixed on the little gray rabbit. She didn’t cry, but the determined look in the eyes was unignorable.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue knew his daughter well. Once she liked something, that thing would become irreplaceable to her. But, what could he do? The rabbit belonged to the female zombie. Should he ask the zombie for the rabbit?</p> <p>Besides, he felt that it was pretty strange for a zombie to keep a rabbit as a pet. She didn’t keep the rabbit as food stock, did she?</p> <p>He had no idea that he had actually guessed right. Lin Qiao did want to keep the rabbit as a food stock back when she threw it into her space.</p> <p>Just now, Lin Qiao was wondering why didn’t the rabbit run away, but came back to her feet. So, when Wu Chengyue suddenly showed up beside Wu Yueling, she just glanced at him carelessly.</p> <p>Seeing that Wu Yueling was held in Wu Chengyue’s arms, she took out the notebook and began writing again. Having finished writing, she ripped the paper off, wadded it up, and threw it at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue held his daughter with one hand and caught the wad of paper with another. Then, he unwrapped the paper and saw a line written on it.</p> <p><em>‘Now, I have given your daughter back to you. She’s perfectly unharmed. We’ll go our separate ways and mind our own businesses from now on. Bye!’</em></p> <p>When Wu Chengyue raised his head again, Lin Qiao had disappeared from where she was. He looked around but failed to see the zombie, and the little rabbit was also gone.</p> <p>“Do you think… she has her life memories?” Meng Yue walked to Wu Chengyue with a frown, abruptly asking a question while thinking.</p> <p>“Eh?” Wu Chengyue turned back to look at her. His eyes glowed slightly when he heard her question, and then he nodded slightly.</p> <p>“I think so too. Otherwise, how do we explain her human-like behavior?” she said.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue had thought about that question long ago. In comparison with those irrational ordinary zombies, and those completely dehumanized high-level zombies, Lin Qiao acted exactly like a human being who looked like a zombie.</p> <p>She had shown no appetite for human beings, and she knew how to take care of a child. She never ate or hurt human beings; the way she had been acting was completely against the nature of zombies, and…</p> <p>“She was tasting the snake’s blood just now. Does that mean she eats animals?” Wu Chengyue guessed while recalling how Lin Qiao dipped her claw into the snake’s blood and put it into her mouth just now. His face showing confusion.</p> <p>Meng Yue’s eyes glowed as she looked at Wu Chengyue and said, “It’s highly possible. Zombies have an instinctive sense of hunger. So, if she doesn’t eat human beings, she might eat animals instead to fill her stomach. That makes sense. But, we’ve never heard about zombies eating animals. Those mutant animals don’t eat zombies either. They’re all infected by the same kind of virus, so I guess they taste flavorless to each other. But, I think that female zombie hadn’t been seeing herself as a zombie!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at his daughter. While checking if Wu Yueling was hurt, he said to Meng Yue, “That might be the truth. Otherwise, why didn’t she eat Ling Ling, who’s a living human being? What I’m curious about now, if she has her life memories, did she regain her memories after becoming a zombie, or had she never lost them when becoming a zombie?”</p> <p>Meng Yue shook her head and responded, “That I can’t tell for sure. We should have asked her about that just now! I wonder if more zombies like her have started showing up in the city. If she is hostile to the bases of human survivors, our base will face a great danger when she upgrades and learns how to control other zombies!”</p> <p>The look in Meng Yue’s face changed suddenly as she was speaking. After that, she continued regretfully, “We should have kept that zombie just now, then figured out her condition! By letting her go, we’ve let go of an invisible bomb which might go off at any time.”</p> <p>Hearing her words, Wu Chengyue fell in silence.</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Yueling suddenly twisted her body in Wu Chengyue’s arms as she had heard their conversation and sensed their hostility toward Lin Qiao. Then, she shook her head quickly when Wu Chengyue turned to look at her.</p> <p><em>‘No, Sister Zombie won’t hurt people!’ </em>she thought.</p> <p>Seeing the look of disapproval in his daughter’s eyes, Wu Chengyue sighed and said to Meng Yue, “I don’t think what you said will happen. At least, that female zombie restrained her zombie instincts well today and showed no bad intentions toward us human beings. And, I think she might be a Southerner. She’s been heading South the whole time, so maybe she’s trying to find her family, or go back to her hometown.”</p> <p>Meng Yue glanced at him in surprise and said, “How can you be sure that she has no bad intention toward human beings? What if her zombie instincts suppress her mind someday? If that happens, she will lose her humanity while continuing to be as smart as human beings. She would become like a sharp sword pointing at all human beings.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at Meng Yue, then at his daughter. Wu Yueling wore a sad look as she was worried that her father might not believe her. Seeing that look, Wu Chengyue smiled. “But, she has even earned Ling Ling’s trust. I don’t think she’s a bad zombie. Ling Ling is so sensitive that she never wants to get near to other people, yet she was willing to be close with that zombie. I think I can believe my Ling Ling,” he said.</p> <p>Wu Yueling nodded quickly.</p> <p>Meng Yue looked at both of them, then sighed and said, “Alright, I’ll believe you. I hope she’ll never lay a finger on the bases of human beings, or we’ll be facing a serious trouble. Okay, let’s go. We’ve got Ling Ling back now, and we can finally return to the base.”</p> <p>While talking, Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue turned to walk out of the orchard. Wu Yueling glanced at where Lin Qiao disappeared just now, seeming to be reluctant to leave.</p> <p>When they walked out of the orchard, they saw their car from a distance. However, the other vehicle was now gone.</p> <p>As they were coming back to the road from the field, Wu Chengyue saw Xiao Licheng staring at the road with confusion, seeming to be stunned. He didn’t know what the latter had seen.</p> <p>“Licheng? What happened? Eh? Where’s the other car? Did someone drive it away?” After coming up from the field, Meng Yue looked at where Lin Qiao’s car was parked, and the wheel tracks on the ground with surprise, then asked.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng now came back to himself. With a strange look in his face, he looked at Meng Yue and Wu Chengyue and said, “Yeah… It has been driven away! But, I didn’t see anyone come near this place. I suddenly heard the car door bang, and before I could check what was happening, that car drove itself away!”</p> <p>After saying that, he widened his eyes as if he was looking at a ghost. Then, he suddenly saw Wu Yueling, who was in Wu Chengyue’s arms, and said in surprise, “Eh? Little Ling Ling…You found her?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue glanced at each other, as they shared the same thought at that moment.</p> <p><em>‘It wasn’t that female zombie who drove the car away, was it?’</em></p> <p>Ordinary zombies couldn’t possibly do that. But just now, both of them had seen how special Lin Qiao was. It wasn’t such a strange thing for a female zombie who had her original memories to be able to drive!</p>",
  "Chapter 80: Eat the Snake, Drink its Blood": "<p>Meng Yue blinked, and soon felt that she had guessed right. “Yeah, Ling Ling was in that orchard just now. We followed her vibe here at the first place, so why are you so surprised?” She then said to Xiao Licheng.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng smiled and responded, “Ah, I didn’t know you could find her so quickly. You didn’t say that she was nearby just now!”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng was a stranger to Wu Yueling. Seeing him, she silently wrapped her arms around Wu Chengyue’s neck and stayed motionless. However, her eyes had been fixed on the orchard. Perhaps, she was still thinking about Lin Qiao.</p> <p>At that time, Lin Qiao had entered her space and brought the car along with her. As a matter of fact, she wasn’t far away from Wu Chengyue and his people.</p> <p>Earlier on, after entering her space in the orchard, she immediately turned herself invisible, then came out and left that area to find Junjun, who had hidden nearby for a long time.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed Junjun when the latter came to find her. The smart Junjun didn’t show up right beside her, maybe because she was worried that she might hinder her. Therefore, Lin Qiao conveniently found where she was hiding on the way while leaving, and sent her into the space.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao walked out of the orchard immediately to get her car. She found another car parked next to hers, being guarded by a soldier.</p> <p>To avoid catching that soldier’s attention, she stayed in the invisible state and quietly walked to her car, then quickly entered her space, switched to the visible state, and came out. After that, she sat on the driver’s seat as quickly as she could and started the car before stepping on the gas. With this series of swift and continuous movements, she drove the car away.</p> <p>On seeing the stunned look on Xiao Licheng’s face from the rearview mirror, she even wanted to laugh.</p> <p>After driving to a distance away, she got off the car and sent it into her space, then entered the space herself. She didn’t drive further away because she was prepared to go back to that farm after Wu Chengyue and his people had left.</p> <p>At this moment, Lin Qiao and Junjun were squatting beside the body of that giant snake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found a large bowl, then found an artery of the snake and cut it open with her sharp nails. When the blood spurted out, she hurriedly caught it with the bowl.</p> <p>However, as the snake had died for a while, its blood wasn’t flowing fast. After filling half of Lin Qiao’s bowl, the blood stopped gushing out.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took back the bowl and put it under her nose to sniff at it. The snake’s blood had a faint fishy smell, and smelled nice. Lin Qiao didn’t drink it instantly, but handed the bowl to Junjun instead.</p> <p>Junjun took over the bowl with curiosity, then brought it under her nose and sniffed at it. However, she caught no smell at all, so she looked back at her with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed her thought and learned that Junjun might have no appetite for blood or flesh of mutant animals. However, she didn’t plan to give up, but pointed at her mouth and signaled for the latter to drink the blood.</p> <p>Junjun knitted her brows. She was scared of snakes, so even though the giant snake had died, it still looked horrible to her. But now, Lin Qiao was asking her to drink its blood, and she found that rather unacceptable.</p> <p>She looked at Lin Qiao with hesitation, then saw her nodded at her determinedly. She wasn’t able to disobey Lin Qiao’s instructions, so without any other choice, she took a deep breath and prepared to drink the snake blood, even though she couldn’t actually breathe.</p> <p>While fighting against the sense of repulsion in her heart, Junjun put the bowl to her lips, and then forced herself to take a sip. After that…</p> <p>She tasted nothing! The snake’s blood was thick, but was completely flavorless! It didn’t taste as bad as she thought it would.</p> <p>She smacked her lips, then glanced at the blood in the bowl, and at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could sense Junjun’s feelings. She knew that the latter felt repulsion toward the snake blood, but didn’t dislike it; so she asked her to continue drinking it.</p> <p>Junjun frowned and finished the bowl at one gulp.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know if the snake blood could suppress Junjun’s hunger, but she assumed that nothing bad would happen when she drank it, because zombies wouldn’t have diarrhea anyway.</p> <p>After Junjun finished the bowl of blood, Lin Qiao took the bowl back, then made another cut on the snake’s body and continued collecting its blood.</p> <p>Then, she raised the bowl and drank the blood herself.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t feel the cool temperature of the snake blood, but had sensed a sweet and salty flavor spread in her mouth. She quickly finished the second bowl of blood like drinking water.</p> <p>After that, she collected another bowl of blood and handed it to Junjun. However, the latter stood up and shook her head while stepping backward.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t force Junjun to drink it, but finished the third bowl of blood herself.</p> <p>She didn’t get any more blood when she cut the snake’s body for the fourth time. So, she gave Junjun the bowl and asked her to wash it, then began peeling the snake.</p> <p>While peeling the snake, she tore off the snake’s flesh and put into her mouth. She wanted to invite Junjun to eat together with her, but then gave up as she saw the look of dislike on the latter’s face.</p> <p>Junjun washed the bowl, then turned back to find that Lin Qiao was eating the snake with an appetite. However, she had no interest in the snake at all, so she went back to the small space to check on the little boy.</p> <p>The little boy was sitting on the bed on his own, holding a half-eaten strawberry.</p> <p>Earlier on, Lin Qiao thought that she wouldn’t be able to finish the whole snake in one meal. She was wondering how many days could the snake flesh be stored in her space without going bad. As her space wasn’t a vacuum space, and the time wasn’t frozen in here, she assumed that the snake’s body would definitely go bad over time.</p> <p>She sat down and began wondering if she could finish the whole snake at one time while eating.</p> <p>However, her stomach…</p> <p>Thinking of her stomach, she automatically lowered her head to look at her belly. Well, she could only see her clothes at that moment. She wanted to touch her stomach with her hand, but as her hands were covered in the sticky fluid from the snake, she then gave up.</p> <p>Thus, she continued eating. While eating, she was also observing the situation outside. When she saw that Wu Chengyue and his people drive their car away, she sighed in relief.</p> <p>They had finally left. She still needed to go back to pick some vegetables!</p> <p>Yes, she didn’t leave because she wanted to go back to pick some vegetables; and not only pick some vegetables, she also wanted to dig up some edible vegetables and then transplant them in her space.</p> <p>With this thought, she stood up immediately. Then, she discovered that she had already eaten a half of that snake! Looking at the snake’s body which was now half-skeleton and half-untouched, she was a little stunned.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! How could I eat so much!’</em></p> <p>She was really shocked. That snake was even thicker than her thighs! It was about twelve meters long, and weighed at least two hundred and fifty kilograms.</p> <p>She had actually eaten a half of that snake at one time! Even though she didn’t eat the bones, she had still swallowed a giant amount of snake flesh. But, the problem was that where did the snake flesh go? And more importantly… she still felt hungry!</p> <p>She glanced at the snake again, finding that she had eaten the lower half of the snake and left the upper half untouched. The snake’s internal organs hadn’t been removed either.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then dug out the snake’s gallbladder. She decided to finish the gallbladder first, then go out to pick vegetables.</p>",
  "Chapter 81: It Was So Bitter!": "<p>Looking at the lemon-sized, black colored snake gallbladder, Lin Qiao opened her mouth wide, prepared to swallow it. When she put it into her mouth without any hesitation, it was torn by her canine teeth immediately.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>The bile flushed into her mouth, and then she froze.</p> <p><em>‘Damn, damn!’</em></p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>She gave a weird howl, then covered her mouth with her claws. Her entire face was twisted. After that, she sprung up and rushed toward the lakeside.</p> <p>“Roar?” Being startled by Lin Qiao’s roar, Junjun hurriedly ran out of the small space to see what was going on. She saw Lin Qiao lying by the lakeside with her whole face soaking in the water, but she didn’t know what had happened!</p> <p>After soaking her face in the water and taking a few large gulps, Lin Qiao raised her head, holding a mouthful of water as she struggled up from the ground with a painful look. Then, she squatted by the lake to wash her hands.</p> <p>The snake’s bile was so awfully bitter. She now felt that the bitter taste had occupied her whole tongue. It was so, so bitter! She had once tasted goldthread roots, but even that wasn’t as bitter as the bile!</p> <p>She turned her head to spit the water held in her mouth, then finished washing her hands and scooped some more water for herself to drink. After that, she finally felt a little better; but only a little, because the bitter taste in her mouth hadn’t faded yet!</p> <p>She knitted her brows, gazed at the lake with a slightly twisted face. Suddenly, she had an idea.</p> <p>As the lake water had magical effects, she wondered what would happen if she soaked the rest of the snake in the lake. Would the lake water be able to keep the snake meat fresh?</p> <p>With this idea, she turned and ran back to the snake body, then swung her claws toward its skeleton tail.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>The skeleton half of the snake was disconnected from the upper body.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao spread the snake’s skin which she had peeled off earlier on the ground, then cut the snake meat into pieces. As the snakeskin had been removed, her claws now became very handy. She cut off the snake’s bones and meat quite easily, then divided them into small pieces to pile on the snakeskin.</p> <p>Fortunately, in order to water the strawberry plants, she had brought many buckets into her space from the outside earlier. Now, she could put the snake meat in these buckets, then pour in the lake water to soak them. Instead of soaking the entire snake in the lake, she now only had to leave the snake meat in the buckets for a while to find out if the water could keep it fresh. Otherwise, if the snake went bad in the lake, the whole lake would stink, wouldn’t it?</p> <p>She finished cutting with a bitter face, then went to wash her hands. After that, she didn’t go to get buckets herself; she took out a piece of paper and wrote a note, then walked to Junjun, who was standing at a distance to see what was happening. She gave the note to the latter, then dragged the skeleton half of the snake and its head, and disappeared.</p> <p><em>‘Help me putting the snake meat into the buckets, then soak it with lake water.’</em></p> <p>After coming out, Lin Qiao threw the snake bones and head to the grass aside, then touched her stomach. There was still a giant hole in her belly, and a half of her stomach was still missing. However, she had just swallowed half of a giant snake. Where did all that snake meat go?</p> <p><em>‘This is unscientific!’ </em>She thought.</p> <p>But then, she realized that her becoming a zombie was already very unscientific! Was there anything more unscientific than that? So, she told herself that she should just get used to all that happened to her.</p> <p>However, the problem was that even though she had eaten a ton of snake meat, she was still hungry! She suddenly felt that she was more like a constantly craving hungry ghost than a zombie!</p> <p>While thinking about her current body condition, Lin Qiao entered that farm from another location.</p> <p>She felt that the crops in this farm weren’t all inedible as the others believed. Even though all the crops here were infected by the virus, Lin Qiao believed that if she transplanted them into her space and watered them with the lake water every day, the virus might be erased gradually.</p> <p>She believed so because the strawberry plants in her space were fairly healthy by now, and were almost free from the virus already. That awful smell was gone as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to find some edible vegetables from the farm, not only because of the little boy in her space or Wu Yueling, who lived there before, but also because of her family. She believed that if foods had become scarce in the whole world, her family in the South might need some food to survive as well.</p> <p>She was thinking that if she could find some vegetables which hadn’t mutated so severely in the farm and collect some seeds, she might be able to grow them in her space.</p> <p>She couldn’t tell for sure if the vegetables like cabbages would survive after being dug out and transplanted in her space. That whole process would be a little troublesome, but she had to try, and could do it very quickly. As for beans and melons, their seeds would be easy to collect.</p> <p>With these thoughts, Lin Qiao began digging vegetables in the farm. She directly dug out some well-grown vegetables and threw them into her space along with the soil. She didn’t know if those vegetables could survive or not, but as she had successfully transplanted strawberry plants in this way, these vegetables might survive as well!</p> <p>In fact, she knew nothing about gardening or agriculture at all! Right now, she was just making every possible effort.</p> <p>She also found a lot of potatoes. The mutant potato plants looked a little weird, but Lin Qiao discovered that the potatoes which were buried underground were only slightly mutated.</p> <p>Apart from that, she had also found something in common among the mutant plants in the post-apocalyptic world—The more a plant changed in appearance, the less amount of virus it turned out to contain. Some plants obviously had mutated and carried the virus, but in fact, they were mostly edible.</p> <p>She felt that those plants might have developed these changes for self-preservation.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was in quite a haste to head to her hometown, but at that moment, she still stopped in the farm for those possibly edible vegetables. She did that because one day, what she did here might help her family. But of course, that was only if her family members were still alive.</p> <p>In consideration of time, she only spent about half a day in the farm. She picked some lightly infected vegetables, including a pile of giant pumpkins and some potatoes, even including a few uninfected plants. Apart from those, she also collected some old, half-dried beans for seeds.</p> <p>After that, she entered her space, found a clearing, and began digging. She didn’t have a hoe or any other tools, so she could only dig with her claws.</p> <p>Junjun put her son on the bed which was placed on the grass and used to belong to Wu Yueling, then went to help Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After Lin Qiao finished digging holes, Junjun planted the vegetables in the holes along with the soil from the outside, then earthed it up. After that, she carried some water from the lake to water the vegetables. They worked for quite a while. Only until the little boy sat up on the bed and called his mom did they stop.</p> <p>“Mom! I’m hungry!” The little boy widely opened his black and bright eyes, saying while looking at Junjun, who had washed her hands and was walking toward him.</p> <p>After eating the strawberries, the little boy’s eyes weren’t as dull as before. However, his face still looked sallow.</p> <p>Junjun was still worrying about her son’s physical condition, but it was already way better than before when she hadn’t met Lin Qiao. Back then, she couldn’t find any food or water for her son, and had been worried sick. So, at least the situation was turning out to be better.</p>",
  "Chapter 82: Make A Snake Soup with the Lake Water": "<p>Lin Qiao glanced at the little boy’s face, then exited her space. She went to the woods beside the farm to collect a lot of dried wood, then went back in. After that, she thought for a moment, then picked a few pieces of rocks and built a small stove on a clearing by the lake with them.</p> <p>She didn’t have many things in her space by now, but had everything she needed at the moment, such as pots. Xie Dong broke a pot earlier on, but she had more of them.</p> <p>She had also collected many useful things from the flat where the little boy was found, and the store not far away from there.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at all the melons that she had piled on the grass, then wrote on the paper—’I <em>‘ll make him some snake soup.’</em></p> <p>Junjun paused briefly, then looked at Lin Qiao with hesitation. Lin Qiao read her mind and learned what she was thinking.</p> <p>She was thinking that the snake was mutant, full of viruses. She wondered if it was really edible for the child. What if the child got infected?</p> <p>Lin Qiao took out the paper and continued writing— <em>‘Like I said, the water in the lake can erase the virus. The snake meat has been soaked in the water for a while. Later, I’ll blanch it and then boil it. I think the virus would be gone after that.’</em></p> <p>After showing the note to Junjun, she began starting a fire on the stone stove. Building a fire in the wilderness wasn’t difficult for her. After all, she had done a lot of field training before, and often needed to cook food in the wilderness. More importantly, she had found a working lighter in the store before.</p> <p>However, she didn’t have any salt, so the soup she made wouldn’t be so delicious. But anyhow, it would be better than nothing.</p> <p>After the fire was built, she filled a pot with water, then put it on the stove.</p> <p>Next, she took a piece of snake meat out of a bucket, and put on a soup plate. Then, she realized that she had no way to cut the meat into small pieces together with the bones, because she didn’t have a knife! She had been using a dagger, but it was too small. It could cut the meat, but wouldn’t be able to break the bones.</p> <p>Therefore, she had no choice but to pick the meat off the bones with that dagger. She first cut off the part which had been cut by her claws, then carefully sliced the meat off. While doing that, she had also been putting some meat into her own mouth. When all the meat was shaved off, she threw the snake bone aside.</p> <p>After that, she washed the snake meat with the lake water, then waited for the water on the stove to boil.</p> <p>Junjun stood by her side, watching her do all this. She wanted to help, but seeing that the other’s moves were so quick and smooth, she felt that the latter didn’t need her help.</p> <p>The wood collected by Lin Qiao quickly burst into flames as they were all very dry. She hadn’t put too much water in the pot, so before long, the water began steaming.</p> <p>When the water began to boil, Lin Qiao poured it into the soup plate to blanch the snake meat, then poured it away. After that, she put the snake meat into the pot along with cool water to boil.</p> <p>She broke a lot of dry branches, then put them into the stove to make the fire stronger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Junjun couldn’t see the color of the fire. In their eyes, the fire was transparent. They couldn’t feel the temperature of the fire either, but could sense that the fire was filled with a scorching energy.</p> <p>She blanched the snake meat again, then added more cool water to stew it. Halfway, she peeled a potato and threw it into the pot. When she felt that the soup was almost ready, she picked a few uninfected leafy vegetables, washed them, and then put in the pot.</p> <p>Sensing the scent of the snake soup, Lin Qiao lost her interest in the snake meat inside. She was only interested in raw meat!</p> <p>However, she could tell if the scent contained any virus and the soup was edible for human beings. At last, the snake soup became very thick, because the potato was cooked to a pulp.</p> <p>“Whoa…” When Lin Qiao put out the fire and put some soup into a bowl to send it to the little boy along with a small spoon, the boy burst into tears. Her ugly face had again scared that kid.</p> <p>Looking at the back of the boy’s head and realizing that he was crying because of her ugly face, Lin Qiao felt speechless.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! My kindness came to no good…’ </em>She thought. Junjun gave her an apologetical smile, then hurriedly took over the soup.</p> <p>Lin Qiao expressionlessly watched her take away that bowl of soup, then went out of that small space. After that, she exited her space. She glanced at the farm, then let out the car and continued driving South.</p> <p>She soon drove on the highway, heading straight South. Before long, she drove out of Sea City and entered Zhe Province.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Nothing troubled her during the rest of her journey. The level-five, ice-powered zombie was no longer chasing her, and the little one was sent back to her father. Now, she was only with Junjun and her son. Two female zombies and a human child… What a strange group!</p> <p>During the journey, Lin Qiao made snake soup for the little boy twice a day. With the starchy food such as potatoes, the little boy gradually became much more energetic than before.</p> <p>Lin Qiao would also make some time to observe those vegetables that she planted unskilfully with her claws.</p> <p>She figured that all the energy of her space was concentrated in the lake, because all the vegetables which were watered by the lake water survived. At first, she thought it was because of the soil, so she left a few unwatered plants; but those died very soon.</p> <p>She had also found out that the lake water could really keep food fresh, because the snake meat soaked in the bucket never showed a sign of going bad.</p> <p>In order to arrive at the South as soon as possible, Lin Qiao drove day and night. In the first few days, she would only stop when cooking for the little boy. Later on, Junjun had learned now to make snake soup, and taken over the responsibility for cooking her son’s meals.</p> <p>Junjun too made some discoveries. Sometimes, she would feel very hungry, longing to pounce on the little boy and bite him when she sensed his scent. Every time that happened, she would run to the lakeside and drink from the lake as much as she could. Gradually, she discovered that the lake water could restrain her appetite for living human beings.</p> <p>After finding that out, Junjun was quite happy. After all, with the lake water, she wouldn’t lose her mind and hurt the little boy at least.</p> <p>Soon, Lin Qiao drove across Zhe Province and entered Min Province.</p> <p>At that point, the people she was looking for had entered Min Province as well, but from the opposite direction.</p> <p>Lin Feng and his few loyal followers protected his family to escape from Yue Province, avoiding numerous pursuing forces on their way.</p> <p>In Longyan City of Zhe Province, a group of people was quietly hiding In a place which used to be a karaoke club, on the top floor of a four-story shopping mall.</p> <p>The front door of the club was shut tightly, guarded by two soldiers in camouflage clothing. A young man was sitting on the billiard table by the door, legs crossed and face darkened. He was holding a thumb-thick wooden stick with one hand and a sharp dagger with the other; he had been slowly sharpening the stick with the dagger.</p> <p>He had sharpened one end of the wooden stick well already.</p> <p>A group of people was crowded in a room in the club. Some were sitting, and some were standing, all remaining silent. Among these people was a man in his thirties. He had an angular face and a very serious vibe. His eyes were sharp, thin lips pressed into a straight line. He looked so serious that ordinary people wouldn’t dare to approach him. A smart-looking little girl was sitting on his lap.</p> <p>The little girl wasn’t tall, but had a delicate and adorable face. Her clothes were clean, and her large eyes were sparkling brightly.</p>",
  "Chapter 83: The Runaway Troop": "<p>Sitting beside that man was a middle-aged woman whose entire body was giving out a sad vibe. The clothes she was wearing seemed to be cheap, but were very clean and neat. Her long hair was combed into a loose ponytail. The tips of the middle-aged woman’s brows were turning down, reflecting her sadness.</p> <p>Two women were sitting on an old couch, both looking about thirty years old; outstandingly pretty, their eyes showed an aggressive look.</p> <p>Women were rare in the post-apocalyptic world, but there were four of them in this room.</p> <p>Two men were standing by each side of the door of this room; both were young, about twenty years old.</p> <p>“Killing Qiao wasn’t enough for that animal named Yang Jianhua! Now, he wants to destroy all of us! So sick! I didn’t think that a man could be so ungrateful! We shouldn’t have let Qiao keep him back then!” The middle-aged woman said through clenched teeth. The anger and hatred in her eyes soon covered her sadness.</p> <p>“Hm! He has also cast his eyes on my sister-in-law and me. That lascivious man had coveted our eldest sister for long, and never tried to hide his desire in front of my sister-in-law and me. If our eldest sister hadn’t been restraining him, he might have done something long ago. But, Sister Lin only believed him, and never believed me!” said one of the two younger women who had long straight hair and a delicate face. Her words were full of hatred and aversion toward Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>The woman beside her had a pretty, baby face. She now had the same angry look as the other young woman did, but she was much more hot-tempered than her.</p> <p>Picturing that man sneakily gazing at her with a sick, disgusting look from the darkness, she turned around and kicked away the little chair next to her.</p> <p>She snorted, not wanting to say anything.</p> <p>“His main purpose now is to kill us. He’s worrying that if he lets us live, we might find a chance to take revenge against him one day. That’s why he has been chasing after us all this time. I’m afraid he’ll never be able to fall asleep before he has killed us with his own hands,” said the man holding the little girl calmly.</p> <p>“Aunty… Aunty is so strong! She won’t die!” The little girl sitting on the man’s laps pouted and said.</p> <p>The man turned to look at her. His sharp gaze softened slightly as he rubbed her head, then sighed and said, “Maybe… We can only wait for A to bring a reliable message back to us.”</p> <p>“Feng, this place isn’t safe. We should leave as soon as possible. We must meet Li Zheng and his people before we plan our next step.” The middle-aged woman forced herself to calm down, then said to her son.</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at his mother, then nodded and responded, “This place isn’t safe indeed. Now that we’ve had some rest and regained some energy, let’s go.”</p> <p>While speaking, he lifted his daughter and stood up to walk out. The others all followed him closely out of the room.</p> <p>Among the three waiting in the lobby, the young man who had been patiently sharpening the wooden stick leaped off the billiards table once he saw them coming out.</p> <p>“Finally leaving?” He asked.</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at him and asked, “How’s the situation outside? Did you feel anything?”</p> <p>The young man named Lin Hao shook his head and said, “There’re too few plants in this city, so the range of my sensation isn’t large. But, I haven’t sensed any danger from around this building.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and said, “Then, let’s go.”</p> <p>Hearing him, the others stepped slightly backward while the two soldiers guarding by the door opened it.</p> <p>Once the door was opened, the zombies which were crowding before the door and trying to get in immediately fell to the ground.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>After a series of gunshots, the zombies which just got in were finished off by the soldiers in the club. Every bullet they shot out killed a zombie.</p> <p>One of those zombies had a wooden stick stuck in its head. That was exactly the stick sharpened by Lin Hao just now.</p> <p>The others barely made a move. Soon, a group of people exited the club.</p> <p>A few miles away, a troop was resting in a two-story building. At that moment, they were all turning to where the shopping mall was located, as if they had sensed something.</p> <p>“Did you hear a gunshot just now?” A man stood up, looking around with confusion.</p> <p>“No! Did you mishear?” Someone responded.</p> <p>“I can’t hear anything now… I might have misheard…” he said.</p> <p>“Which direction? Let’s go take a look. We’ll then find out if you misheard or not! That might be them. Don’t miss any chance.”</p> <p>“You’re right! It seemed to come from… that direction,” said the man.</p> <p>“Line up! Let’s go over there!”</p> <p>“Yes, Sir! Ready to go!”</p> <p>However, when they found the shopping mall, they saw nothing but dead zombies and some traces left on the ground by vehicles.</p> <p>Lin Feng and his people only shot the zombies on the top floor dead, but tried their best to avoid starting any fight after coming down. They got into their cars as quickly as they could and then drove away.</p> <p>“They drove that way. Keep chasing!”</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao was going through Ning De City.</p> <p>She was still driving, and Junjun was sitting in the front seat. After leaving Sea City, they had driven across Zhe Province and entered Min Province. They hadn’t seen any human beings these few days, but had encountered a few high-level zombies. Those were merely level three or four zombies, and Lin Qiao took care of them quite easily.</p> <p>Level-three zombies were very easy to deal with for her, while level-four zombies were slightly more difficult. But anyhow, all those zombies were much easier to defeat than the level-five one which she encountered before.</p> <p>After finishing those zombies, she absorbed their zombie nuclei for fun. That was a pleasant thing to do after all.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t think that she could drive through the entire Zhe Province so easily and quickly. However, she had been having a strange feeling ever since she entered Ning De City. She couldn’t tell if that was a good feeling or a bad one.</p> <p>Throughout the journey, Lin Qiao discovered that the closer she got to the downtown area, the more zombies existed there. She also found out that high-level intelligent zombies were very good at hiding.</p> <p>She had been avoiding downtown areas all the way, so that she wouldn’t encounter too many zombies. Many ordinary zombies liked to wander on the streets. When Lin Qiao drove near them, they would sense her vibe and move away, but they could only shamble very slowly…</p> <p>Therefore, after being jammed by zombies for a few times, Lin Qiao decided to go through the sparsely populated areas.</p> <p>Since she had entered Ning De City, that weird feeling had been occurring to her more and more frequently. That feeling wasn’t strong, but she had to pay attention to it, because she needed to know what caused her to have that feeling.</p> <p>She drove concentratively for a few hours and passed through the entire Ning De City, but nothing happened in the whole while, neither had she discovered anything.</p>",
  "Chapter 84: Zombies Block the Way": "<p>Lin Qiao didn’t know that the people she was looking for weren’t far away from her. They were at a distance of two cities, but she missed them!</p> <p>When she drove into Fu Zhou City, Lin Feng and his people had entered San Ming City. Lin Qiao was heading to Pu Tian and Quan Zhou, while Lin Feng and his families were driving toward Nan Ping City.</p> <p>Therefore, they missed each other. Lin Qiao didn’t encounter Lin Feng and his family who were being chased, but entered Fu Zhou City with Junjun.</p> <p>Their way was blocked when passing through Min County.</p> <p>What jammed the road was still a large crowd of zombies. However, what happened this time was a little different than before. Lin Qiao’s way was blocked by a group of zombies which stood straight motionlessly on the ground even before she got near to the central area of this county.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stopped the car and rested her head on the wheel with confusion, looking at the group of motionless zombies which stood two or three hundred meters away.</p> <p>The zombies in this post-apocalyptic world were all unorganized, and would mostly act alone. Even if they occasionally gathered together, they would only shamble around purposelessly.</p> <p>But right now, hundreds of ordinary zombies were standing quietly on the road, staring at Lin Qiao expressionlessly; now that was a little scary!</p> <p>It seemed that all the zombies in this area had gathered in this place, because no other zombies were found except for the crowd which had jammed the road.</p> <p>While Lin Qiao was carefully observing the surrounding environment and the group of weird zombies at the front, Junjun, who was sitting in the back seat, let out a deep roar in pain.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao immediately turned back to look at her. She was holding her head with both hands, and her pale face had twisted badly at that moment. She seemed to be suffering, as her eyes were closed tight, teeth clenched and bared.</p> <p>She seemed to be enduring something, or trying to suppress something.</p> <p>“Roar?”<br/>\n‘What happened?’ Lin Qiao asked.</p> <p>She had no time to write at that point, so she gave Junjun a deep roar to ask that question.</p> <p>“Roar!” Junjun struggled to open her eyes and responded with a roar.</p> <p>From her voice and thoughts, Lin Qiao confirmed one thing—A strong willpower was trying to control her mind and make her obey it. However, when she sensed that willpower, she also felt a great pain in her head, as if a bomb was exploding inside her brain.</p> <p>Willpower? Control? Obey?</p> <p>Lin Qiao remained calm as some thoughts flashed across her mind. She reached out to grab Junjun’s hand, then both of them disappeared from within the car.</p> <p>After entering her space, Lin Qiao immediately began to observe Junjun’s reaction. As she had expected, Junjun relaxed her tightened face after getting in.</p> <p>As Junjun looked relieved, Lin Qiao pointed at her own head. She didn’t say a word, but asked the question with her eyes.</p> <p>Junjun understood her meaning. She took a deep breath, then nodded.</p> <p>She told Lin Qiao that she had stopped receiving that strong willpower after coming in, and her head wasn’t aching anymore. She also informed that her space was able to block the source of that pain, which had just now made her feel like her brain was exploding.</p> <p>It seemed that her space was completely isolated from the outside world, and that made things much easier. However, Lin Qiao still didn’t understand why she didn’t feel anything while Junjun did.</p> <p>At that moment, Junjun had fully recovered from the headache, and thought of the same question. So, she looked at Lin Qiao with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took out a piece of paper and started writing—’I felt nothing.’</p> <p>That deepened Junjun’s confusion, making her look at Lin Qiao with puzzlement.</p> <p>They were both zombies, but why did she have that feeling of pain and danger while Lin Qiao felt nothing?</p> <p>Lin Qiao closed her eyes to observe the outside situation. After finding out that the zombie crowd stayed the same as before, she decided to go out and find out what exactly was happening.</p> <p>‘You stay here, I’ll go out to take a look,’ she wrote on the paper. Junjun nodded in response, as that was the only solution at that point.</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao turned back and exited her space, leaving Junjun in there.</p> <p>After coming out, Lin Qiao was still sitting in the driver’s seat. She stared at the zombie crowd which stood motionlessly in front of her, trying to figure out what was going on.</p> <p>She was a little far away from the zombie crowd, so she decided to drive closer to see if she could sense anything.</p> <p>She felt really strange about the fact that Junjun was affected so badly in this place while she herself sensed nothing. Based on the current condition, she couldn’t make a judgment. If she could sense something, she might be able to figure something out.</p> <p>Lin Qiao drove the car slowly toward the zombie crowd. Normally, all low-level zombies would all slowly draw away when facing her. So, she now wanted to know if these zombies which blocked her way would do the same.</p> <p>As the car moved slowly forward, the distance between Lin Qiao and the zombie crowd was shortened bit by bit. Two-hundred meters… A hundred and fifty meters… fifty meters…</p> <p>When Lin Qiao’s car was getting closer and closer, the crowd of zombies remained motionless. They just silently and expressionlessly stood there, without making any moves.</p> <p>What was strange was that even though the distance had been shortening, Lin Qiao still sensed nothing: no information, no thoughts, no voice screaming ‘hungry’. She sensed absolutely nothing! Why would that happen? She couldn’t sense anything from these zombies!</p> <p>She was used to sense the simple thoughts of ordinary zombies about their simple desires to feed. But now, she was facing so many scary-looking zombies, but still could hear nothing from them. She felt that something was amiss.</p> <p>When the car was seven or eight meters away from the zombie crowd, Lin Qiao hit the brakes. She did that because she caught a sense of danger at that moment, which was causing a great suppression.</p> <p>After she stopped the car, the zombie crowd which had been remaining motionless the whole time silently started moving.</p> <p>The crowd split up slowly and showed a path in the middle, which was wide enough for only one person. After that, Lin Qiao saw a figure slowly walking out through the narrow path from behind the zombie crowd.</p> <p>Lin Qiao figured everything out at the sight of that figure.</p> <p>It turned out that a zombie at a very high-level was there controlling the crowd of ordinary zombies. Keeping hundreds of zombies so well under control and making them quietly stand there required an incredible willpower.</p> <p>Therefore, this high-level zombie which had been slowly walking out of the crowd possessed an extreme willpower! It was even stronger than the level-five zombie that Lin Qiao had encountered before.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at this high-level zombie, feeling a little surprised.</p> <p>This zombie had the same dark-circled eyes as Junjun did, and her face was also perfectly undamaged. Her eyes were blood-red, pupils black; her adorable lips were dark-purple, matching her pale face quite well, not bad-looking at all.</p> <p>Besides, this zombie looked very young. She was a young girl! She was about five-feet and two-inches tall, having a slim body and limbs. She had a doll face, and her long hair was tied in double ponytails, looking very cute.</p> <p>She was wearing a white dress which was perfectly clean, and a pair of red shoes which looked cute as well.</p> <p>However, this pretty young female zombie made Lin Qiao feel a great pressure and a strong sense of danger.</p>",
  "Chapter 85: The Red-eyed Zombie": "<p>After walking out of the zombie crowd, the young female zombie didn’t show any anger or ferocity. She just stood before the crowd with a calm expression, looking at Lin Qiao with curiosity in her eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was also looking at her from up and down. However, she hadn’t been receiving any thoughts from this female zombie, probably because the latter’s level was too high.</p> <p>Looking at those blood-red eyes, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but tighten her entire body.</p> <p>The eyes of ordinary zombies were pale gray, and the eyes of the zombies at level-three or above were pure dark. The level-five zombie that Lin Qiao encountered before also had black eyes; but occasionally, those eyes would glow with faint traces of red light.</p> <p>However, the eyes of the female zombie in front of her were completely red. Unlike the legendary red pupils of vampires, the pupils of this female zombie were black and bright, while the part of her eyes which was supposed to be white was blood-red, glowing with a faint red light.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hadn’t seen such a strange zombie ever since she woke up in the post-apocalyptic world, not even from Lu Tianyu’s memories. According to her memories, Lu Tianyu hadn’t even heard about any zombie like that!</p> <p>Looking at the female zombie’s clean white dress, Lin Qiao felt that she would look exactly like a human being if she didn’t have blood-red eyes and the dark circles underneath.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat in the car motionlessly. The young female zombie stood in front of the car quietly, just looking at Lin Qiao. Both of them remained absolute silent, but this scene seemed to be a little weird: a car parked on one side of a broad road, with a group of dirty-looking zombies in ragged clothes standing in front of the car motionlessly; and a pretty, clean-looking, weird young female zombie standing before the zombie crowd, also motionlessly.</p> <p>If anyone could see this scene, they would freak out and wonder what the hell was happening.</p> <p><em>‘She’s not a… level-six zombie, is she?’ </em>Lin Qiao stared at the pretty young female zombie and thought.  <em>‘Damn! I heard that level-six zombies were rare, and not seen frequently. No one wants to see them anyway, because a level-six zombie can kill a level-six superpowered human being almost instantaneously!’ </em></p> <p>Level-six zombies were very powerful, so human beings never wanted to encounter them. Reaching level-six was awfully difficult for zombies; hence, very few zombies managed to do that.</p> <p>As for level-seven…</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that this young female zombie was even more dangerous than the level-five zombie leader. She now even regretted not drawing back and leaving just now!</p> <p>Based on the current situation, she understood that she had entered this young female zombie’s territory already!</p> <p>At that moment, the young female zombie abruptly raised her delicate nose and sniffed toward Lin Qiao. Then, she let out a scream.</p> <p>Her voice was very shrill and penetrating.</p> <p>Lin Qiao only sensed a pain from her ears before a strong willpower was sent into her brain.</p> <p><em>‘Who are you?’ </em> Through her scream, the young female zombie asked a question with curiosity. Lin Qiao felt no hostility from her, even though her voice was sharp.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? No hostility?’ </em>Lin Qiao was surprised, because this female zombie only showed curiosity toward her, without any other intentions.</p> <p><em>‘So innocent!’ </em>Thought Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Ah!” The young female zombie screamed again as she didn’t get Lin Qiao’s response. Her pair of little canine teeth were faintly visible.</p> <p><em>‘Who are you? Tell me who you are!’ </em>She said.</p> <p><em>‘My ears hurt!’ </em>Lin Qiao complained silently.</p> <p>It seemed that the young female zombie wouldn’t let Lin Qiao pass before the latter introduced herself. So, she thought for a moment and decided to get off the car and communicate with her, as she had shown no hostility so far.</p> <p>She was worried that the female zombie might lose her patience and destroy her car. If the happened, she would be in trouble.</p> <p>At this point, she had completely no intention to find out how powerful this young female zombie who looked like a level-six was.</p> <p>With that thought, she slowly opened the car door and got off the car. In order to let the female zombie know that she didn’t intend to attack, she dared not to move too fast.</p> <p>After Lin Qiao got off the car, the young female zombie tilted her head and began looking at her carefully from head to toe. It was the first time for her to see a zombie who was in clean clothes like herself!</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly looked at the young female zombie after getting off the car without answering the latter’s question immediately. However, the young female zombie started getting impatient. She suddenly moved, as fast as a gust of wind. Within a blink, she was standing right in front of Lin Qiao, about a meter away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao tightened her every muscle instantly and automatically popped her claws.</p> <p>However, the female zombie didn’t scream at her again, but mumbled a few words that made Lin Qiao pause in shock.</p> <p><em>‘Do you have memories?’ </em>She asked. Lin Qiao was stunned, staring at her with disbelief.</p> <p><em>‘What does she mean? A zombie asking another zombie if she has memories? What memories? The memories she had before turning into a zombie?’ </em>Lin Qiao now had so many questions.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found that she had problems understanding this young female zombie’s words.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao make no reaction, the young female zombie showed a confused look. She took a step backward, again looking at Lin Qiao from head to toe. After that, she glanced at the car next to Lin Qiao, then crossed her arms before her chest and began wondering if she had mistaken something.</p> <p><em>‘Isn’t this zombie the same as me?’ </em>She wondered.  <em>‘But she can drive! Why does she know how to drive if she doesn’t have memories?’ </em></p> <p>Seeing the confused look in her face, Lin Qiao suddenly understood the young female zombie’s meaning. So, she took a notepad and a pen out of her pocket and began writing. While writing, she was also observing the young female zombie.</p> <p>As she had expected, after she took out the notepad and the pen, the young female zombie had her eyes glowed, and actually showed a smile.</p> <p><em>‘Do you remember things before the apocalypse?’ </em>Lin Qiao wrote on the notepad.</p> <p>Having finished writing, she raised the notepad to show the question to the young female zombie.</p> <p>The young female zombie was smiling in a pleasant surprise, but her smile froze after she read the words Lin Qiao wrote on the paper. A few seconds later, she suddenly closed her eyes and pounced on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Before Lin Qiao could react, she felt that the young female zombie had embraced her, and then heard a series of howls from next to her ear.</p> <p><em>‘Whooah! Whooah! Whooah!!!’</em></p> <p>Again, Lin Qiao was stunned.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Damn! Who can tell me if I’m listening to this zombie cry? Is she holding me and crying? What the hell is going on? Did anything happen? Who can tell me what on earth has happened?’ </em>She screamed in her head.</p> <p>The young female zombie’s voice was still shrill, but Lin Qiao had sensed the strong sadness contained in it. And, her voice had sent a great amount of information into Lin Qiao’s brain.</p> <p><em>‘I woke up like this! Zombies everywhere! Mom and Dad have both turned into zombies! They don’t remember me anymore! And, they were so afraid of me! They tried to hide every time they saw me! I went to the other human beings, but they attacked me once they saw me! No one told me what happened! No one told me why I became like this! Why do I still have my memories? My parents became zombies, and they saw me as a strange zombie. Once I forgot to keep an eye on them and let them run away, then they were killed by human survivors! Their heads were chopped off! So scary! So scary! I’m so scared! Whoo… I’m not a human being anymore, not a zombie either. I spent five years all alone. No one was there for me! I’m so scared!’ </em></p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed the young female zombie’s fear and sadness which came from the bottom of her heart, and were so real. She was like a poor kid abandoned by the whole world, terrified, helpless, and uneasy.</p>",
  "Chapter 86: The Zombie Named Qiu Lili": "<p>Lin Qiao felt that the young female zombie who was holding her while crying loudly had actually been shaking slightly.</p> <p>She sighed, and gently patted her on her shoulder.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could imagine how scared she must be when she woke up to find that she had become a cold-blooded zombie, and so had her family. Her family didn’t remember her anymore, and no one was there to care for her or look after her. The human beings she met launched lethal attacks on her, so she could only hide. She lived alone in the post-apocalyptic world. All of this might be easier to accept if she were an adult, but she was just a young girl. She might have even been a spoiled little princess who was dependent on her families. To such people, living alone was the most terrifying thing in the world, not to mention the fact that she was still underage when she became a zombie.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t move as the young female zombie was holding her so tight. She heard the zombie crying loudly next to her ear, but couldn’t see if she was shedding tears.</p> <p>She wondered if zombies could shed tears.</p> <p>Lin Qiao waited for a while, then felt a little speechless. The young female zombie had cried for a rather long while, but wasn’t showing any sign of stopping yet. After telling Lin Qiao her family background, she began talking about how she got through the last five years…</p> <p>She tried to seek help from some human beings, but they attacked her at the very sight of her. Even though she didn’t plan to fight back, those human beings never gave her a chance of starting a communication. She tried a few times, but the results were the same. As those superpowered human beings grew stronger and stronger, they soon became threatening to her. Therefore, she gave up on trying to communicate with human beings after that. However, she didn’t like to talk to zombies, because she felt that they were monsters.</p> <p>Besides, zombies only had instincts, without any humanity; including the high-leveled intelligent ones and the superpowered ones. The young female zombie who was used to living in the human society felt that higher level zombies were even more monster-like than the ordinary ones.</p> <p>She couldn’t bear to eat human flesh, dig out human brains, and chew human hearts like the other zombies were doing. So, she hunted animals to feed herself. She forced herself to eat those hunted animals even though they tasted awful, because she had a feeling that she would die if she didn’t eat any meat, even though she was a zombie. Even though she had become a half-human and half-zombie creature, she still wanted to live. The reason was simple, that she was afraid!</p> <p>She cried for three whole minutes, then finally let go of Lin Qiao and stepped back.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao looked at her face and found that her face was completely dry without any tears. However, her eyes had changed quite a lot. Those eyes were merely shining with a faint red light before, but now, that red light was shining so brightly that they even looked like a pair of red bulbs! Fortunately, it was broad daylight, so her eyes weren’t so scary. Lin Qiao couldn’t imagine how dazzling her eyes would be if it were dark now.</p> <p>Seeing that the young female zombie had calmed back down, Lin Qiao took out the notepad and the pen and started writing again. However, before she finished writing, the young female zombie uttered another scream with her shrill voice.</p> <p><em>‘I’ll follow you! Where’re you going? Wherever you go, I’ll go with you!’ </em>She said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stopped writing, then raised her head to look at the young female zombie with surprise. Next, she showed her the note in her hand.</p> <p><em>‘What’s your name?’ </em></p> <p>Lin Qiao had listened to her crying for three minutes, but she hadn’t told her the latter’s name.</p> <p>The young female zombie mumbled to respond— <em>‘Lili… My name is Qiu Lili. I was nearly sixteen before I became a zombie. Why don’t you talk? Why do you write on the paper? Doesn’t writing make you tired?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that this zombie named Qiu Lili was like a curious baby.</p> <p>The red light in her eyes had faded, and by now, those eyes were filled with curiosity. Looking at Qiu Lili, Lin Qiao felt like facing a three-year-old baby.</p> <p>Before she finished thinking, Qiu Lili began roaring to ask her more questions.</p> <p>“Roar, roar, roar?”<br/>\n<em>‘I was trying to control you and the zombie beside you, but I found that I can only control her, while you made no response to my power at all! You’re so strange! And, do you have </em>a space <em>? Just now, you disappeared, and so did your friend!’ </em>She asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head, then nodded and wrote on the paper—’My name is Lin Qiao. I don’t like using my voice because I feel it’s strange! I didn’t feel anything just now. And, I do have a space.’</p> <p>“Roar, roar, roar…”<br/>\n<em>‘But, talking like this is more convenient! Where’re you heading to?’ </em>Asked Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ripped off the first page of the notepad, then threw it into her space, because it was covered with her handwriting. She wouldn’t throw the paper with her handwriting in random places, because she didn’t want anyone to discover them. So, she had been throwing the used paper into her space.</p> <p>After that, she wrote down two words on a new page— <em>‘The South’.</em></p> <p>“Roar, roar!”<br/>\n<em>‘I’m going with you! I’ll go with you! I don’t want to be alone anymore…’ </em>said Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Seeing the begging look in Qiu Lili’s eyes, Lin Qiao felt that the former wouldn’t accept ‘no’ as an answer. She estimated that Qiu Lili would follow her no matter how, as she had sensed that this young female zombie was thinking exactly this way!</p> <p>She also wanted to know why Qiu Lili had blocked her way in this place, and if she often did the same thing here.</p> <p>So, she wrote on the paper— <em>‘How did you know we were passing through here? Why did you control so many zombies to block our way? Did you do this frequently?’</em></p> <p>“Roar, roar…” Qiu Lili gave a few howls. However, as Lin Qiao had been writing the whole time, she suddenly felt quite strange to roar like that.</p> <p>After all, before meeting Lin Qiao, she would only roar at the other zombies to deliver simple messages, such as ‘come here’, ‘get over’, ‘that side’ or ‘this side’, which contained merely one or two words. But now, she needed to roar out long sentences to Lin Qiao. She was a little used to communicating with other creatures by roaring, but now, that made her feel a little weird. In fact, she felt very weird about that.</p> <p>Therefore, she stopped roaring without finishing it, then thought for a moment and abruptly pointed at the pen and notepad in Lin Qiao’s hands.</p> <p>Lin Qiao handed her the pen and notepad. She took over the two objects, then began writing awkwardly.</p> <p>She held the pen with one hand, the notepad with the other, and wrote with a strange gesture. Lin Qiao waited a while for her to finish writing and show her what she wrote.</p> <p><em>‘I sensed that you were approaching, so I sent the zombie crowd to stop you. I’ll stop all the zombies coming from other places and drive them away. If you were human beings, I wouldn’t block your way. The whole town is my territory.’</em></p> <p>She stopped Lin Qiao because she thought that the latter was a zombie from another place, and didn’t want her to enter her territory.</p> <p>Lin Qiao now recalled that most of the high-level zombies had their own territories. Qiu Lili liked this town, so she guarded it to drive away all the zombies from other places. She wouldn’t do the same to human beings, maybe because she knew that human survivors had their own bases and wouldn’t linger in her territory for long.</p> <p>For that reason, she didn’t need to stop the human beings who passed through this area and expose herself. Apart from this, Lin Qiao felt that she had an indescribable fear toward human beings.</p> <p><em>‘A zombie is afraid of human beings?’ </em>Lin Qiao wondered without knowing what to say.</p> <p>She decided to let Qiu Lili follow her since she insisted. Qiu Lili could serve as a guide, as she might know about the location of the bases in the South.</p> <p>From Lu Tianyu’s memories, Lin Qiao had learned that two bases were in the South, but didn’t know about their specific locations.</p>",
  "Chapter 87: Qiu Lili Moves": "<p>Lin Qiao was preparing for a fight, but somehow, the situation had turned into this…</p> <p>She wrote on the paper— <em>‘Do you know about the locations of the two bases in the South? I want to go there.’</em></p> <p>Qiu Lili read the note, then nodded and wrote— <em>‘Are you heading to the two bases? I know where they are. But, why are you going there?’</em></p> <p>She then looked at Lin Qiao’s face and found that the latter’s face was severely damaged, while hair were unbrushed but tied up behind her head. She stared at Lin Qiao’s eyes for a while, then began looking at Lin Qiao’s nose and mouth.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao started feeling weird under her gaze, she wrote down another few lines.  <em>‘You have beautiful eyes, nose, and lips; the shape of your face is pretty too, but the scars look too bad! You look so ugly this way…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was speechless. Qiu Lili wasn’t the only creature who thought she was too ugly…</p> <p>Qiu Lili stared at her for a while, then wrote on the paper— <em>‘Are you going to the bases in the South now? Do you want to take a rest here?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head after reading the note. She needed to find her family; the sooner, the better.</p> <p>Seeing her shaking her head, Qiu Lili thought for a moment, then continued writing— <em>‘Then, please come where I live with me. You have </em>a space <em>, so can you put all my belongings into your space and take with us?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, as that was an easy thing for her to do.</p> <p>Seeing her nod, Qiu Lili directly dragged her arm. Lin Qiao felt that her body suddenly became weightless as a gust of wind took her away from where she was. She moved so fast that before she could see the surrounding environment clearly, the two arrived at a new place, stopping before a small western-style building.</p> <p>Once arriving there, Lin Qiao sensed the vibes of two creatures which were as powerful as herself surrounding the building.</p> <p>“Ah!” At that moment, Qiu Lili suddenly screamed out loud and startled Lin Qiao so badly that she almost sprung to her feet…</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Why did you scream so suddenly? I wasn’t preparing for that! You might scare me to death!’ </em>She complained in her head.</p> <p>Along with Qiu Lili’s scream, two figures showed up on top of the building. They were in human shape, but didn’t look like normal human beings anymore.</p> <p>Those were one male and one female zombie; their legs were bent, backs hunched, hands on both sides of their bodies. Their clothes were all ragged, looking old and dirty. Fortunately, they both had all their limbs.</p> <p>Their faces were both scary-looking. As same as the first intelligent zombie that Lin Qiao encountered, they had black eyes and awful dark circles under those eyes; their noses were flat, mouths cracked ear to ear, and sharp teeth sticking out of their mouth, glowing with a cold light.</p> <p>These two zombies seemed to be afraid of Qiu Lili very much; Lin Qiao could sense their fear toward the other. They also seemed to be under Qiu Lili’s control, as they showed up immediately after she called for them. Clearly, they didn’t dare to go against her.</p> <p>They didn’t dare to get near to Qiu Lili, but stood seven or eight meters away from her, looking at her carefully.</p> <p>“Roar!” Qiu Lili roared at them. After that, these two zombies moved aside and guarded by the front gate of the building. Then, she dragged Lin Qiao’s sleeve and walked into the building.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked around and found that the entire building was very tidy, as if someone would do the cleaning every day. Behind the front gate was a small yard. The concrete floor of the yard was very clean, without any fallen leaves or sands. A tree was standing in the yard.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw that a broom was placed under the tree…</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that it was normal for Qiu Lili to do the things that only human beings would do, as she was a zombie who had human memories like herself. She was just curious about whether she swept the floor herself or made the two zombies outside do it.</p> <p>Qiu Lili looked like a little princess in that clean white dress, so Lin Qiao assumed that she wouldn’t sweep the floor herself, but would make the other zombies do it for her.</p> <p>While picturing the two zombies sweeping the floor, Lin Qiao wanted to laugh. She couldn’t tell why, but she did want to laugh!</p> <p>Stepping on the clean concrete floor, Lin Qiao felt slightly more comfortable than before. The post-apocalyptic world was so dirty and disordered that almost every corner seemed to be a mess. She knew that the bases of human survivors might be much cleaner than the rest of the world, but she had never been in any base.</p> <p>Therefore, ‘messy’ was her first impression of this post-apocalyptic world.</p> <p>After guiding Lin Qiao into the living room on the first floor, Qiu Lili pointed at the suede upper leather sofa set, then at the delicate crystal tea table, and the exquisite tea sets on it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that Qiu Lili wanted her to take these. So, she walked over and sent the sofa set and the tea table and everything on it into her space.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found the well-organized furniture pieces in the living room quite acceptable, but felt a little speechless when she saw the strange plants in the flower pots.</p> <p>Qiu Lili was a zombie who attached importance to hygiene, and knew how to enjoy life. All surviving human beings in the town had fled, so without a doubt, she could take whatever she liked from any house.</p> <p>However, judging by an octopus-like flower, Lin Qiao felt that Qiu Lili had a strange taste.</p> <p>Under Qiu Lili’s guidance, Lin Qiao put everything in the living room into her space, including the table, chairs, cabinets, and the octopus-like flower. Then, Qiu Lili took her to the kitchen for all sorts of beautiful tableware and kitchenware.</p> <p>Qiu Lili had lived in the post-apocalyptic world alone for years. During this time, she had collected many pretty things which were very expensive in the old world.</p> <p>After finishing with the kitchen, Qiu Lili took Lin Qiao to the second floor. Without a question, the three rooms on the second floor were soon emptied by Lin Qiao. Next, they went up to the third floor.</p> <p>Only after Lin Qiao put almost every piece in the building into her space did Qiu Lili take her back downstairs. Lin Qiao felt that the empty area in her space was narrowed after she put all Qiu Lili’s belongings in.</p> <p>After coming out of the building, Qiu Lili pointed at the two zombies which were obediently standing by the gate, and roared at Lin Qiao. She asked her if she could take those two zombies as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t mind. She thought for a moment, then took out the notepad and wrote— <em>‘Up to you. But, they can’t sit in my car.’</em></p> <p>Qiu Lili happily nodded, then took over the notepad from Lin Qiao’s hand and wrote— <em>‘Alright! I’ll let them sit on top of the car then!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao felt a little speechless, but agreed.</p> <p>After that, Qiu Lili roared at the two zombies and dragged Lin Qiao’s arm. Then, Lin Qiao was again taken away by a gust of wind and sent back to her car within a blink.</p> <p>It seemed that Qiu Lili had the wind power.</p> <p>After returning Lin Qiao’s car, Qiu Lili directly sat in the front seat. Before sitting down, she tapped the seat to make sure it was clean. After shutting the car door, she saw the zombie crowd which was still blocking the way.</p> <p>She immediately stuck her head out of the window to scream at the crowd of zombie.</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was just opening the door of the driver’s seat when she heard Qiu Lili’s scream, which caused her hand to shake.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>The door closed itself.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was speechless once again.</p>",
  "Chapter 88: Ling Ling’s Current Situation": "<p>Hearing Qiu Lili’s scream, the crowd of zombies standing motionlessly on the road suddenly began loitering about, as if someone had suddenly turned on their switch. Their neat formation was immediately disorganized.</p> <p>All the zombies began drawing away from Qiu Lili and Lin Qiao once they started moving, as if they were afraid of something and were automatically trying to find another place to stay.</p> <p>The road before Lin Qiao’s car was soon cleared. After that, she started the car. Qiu Lili looked around in her car. When she turned to the backseat, she suddenly recalled that there was another zombie.</p> <p>So, she picked up Lin Qiao’s pen and paper and wrote, <em>‘Where’s your friend? Does she have memories too?’</em></p> <p>Before Lin Qiao, Qiu Lili hadn’t met any zombies with memories; so, she was curious about the other zombie.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hadn’t started driving yet, so she took over the pen and paper, wrote,<em>‘She’s in my space. She’s afraid of you.’</em></p> <p>She meant that they should leave Junjun in her space alone instead of letting her out to face Qiu Lili, who was a level-six zombie.</p> <p>Level-five zombies were called zombie leaders, while level-six zombies were called zombie kings and zombie queens, because they were the highest-leveled zombies which found till now. As for level-seven zombies, even though no human survivors had seen any of them yet, they called them ‘Zombie Dominators’.</p> <p>The clean-looking young female zombie sitting beside Lin Qiao was a wind-powered zombie queen. Lin Qiao didn’t know how powerful Qiu Lili was; but judging by the pressure and the sense of danger that she had been giving off, she should be strong enough to even put up a fight against Wu Yueling’s father, even though she was only a level-six zombie!</p> <p>She didn’t understand why this powerful zombie queen insisted on following her. She felt that she couldn’t understand the latter’s thoughts!</p> <p>Qiu Lili didn’t say much after reading Lin Qiao’s note. She nodded, then let out a deep roar, as if saying, ‘Alright’.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her, then pressed on the accelerator and drove away. Not long after that, she felt that the car suddenly became heavier. She knew that it was because Qiu Lili’s two followers had jumped onto her car.</p> <p>But strangely, it seemed that the two zombies didn’t dare to make any loud sound, as if they were afraid that they might disturb Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili, who were sitting in the car. In fact, they were only afraid of Qiu Lili.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Chengyue had taken Wu Yueling back to the base. During the journey, he found that his daughter’s personality hadn’t changed much, because she was still ignoring people, and wouldn’t talk. Wu Chengyue didn’t know how to make his daughter talk, and had already gotten used to her being like that. However, it was a good thing for him to find that his daughter remained the same as before, as he was worrying that she might have been scared by the female zombie and become even more withdrawn.</p> <p>Since what he had feared didn’t happen, he had relaxed a little by now. Earlier on, when he left that orchard, he felt that his daughter seemed to be reluctant to part with that female zombie. Wu Yueling didn’t tell him anything back then, but he still felt that way because he saw her turning back to look for that zombie from time to time.</p> <p>Even though the personality of his daughter didn’t change, her body seemed to have changed.</p> <p>Since he held his daughter the first time that day, Wu Chengyue had been feeling that her daughter’s body was filled with a magical energy.</p> <p>He didn’t know what that was. That energy wasn’t like a superpower, yet was like a power which was hiding inside her body, and had yet to be triggered. At first, he was worried that that energy might bring harm to his daughter; but after asking Meng Yue to sense it, he found that energy to be very gentle, and seemed to be protective. Somehow, that energy was protecting Wu Yueling.</p> <p>After knowing that energy wouldn’t hurt his daughter, but was protecting her instead, Wu Chengyue stopped worrying, and began feeling happy for his daughter. After all, it was a good thing.</p> <p>During the journey, he had been studying the energy inside his daughter’s body. However, he couldn’t figure out what exactly did that female zombie do to Wu Yueling. She not only took good care of his daughter, but also put a protective energy inside Wu Yueling’s body.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue also had a feeling that if that energy was triggered, his daughter might have a special superpower.</p> <p>After returning to the base, Wu Yueling still wouldn’t let anyone get near her, except for her father and Meng Yue, who was very amiable.</p> <p>Therefore, when the two of them weren’t busy, they would stay with Wu Yueling in her room. Alternatively, Wu Chengyue would bring Wu Yueling to his office. The people around him were all used to that quiet little girl.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was very quiet. If her father let her stay in her room, she would sit on her bed; her father had no way to find out what she was thinking. If her father took her to the office, she would sit silently on the couch, or sleep. While she was awake, she would always be in a daze.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue worried that she might get bored, so he decided to get her a pet. When she came out of the female zombie’s space, he saw that she was holding a little rabbit. Therefore, he found some small fluffy animals for his daughter.</p> <p>Those small animals were scarce and precious in the post-apocalyptic world, which was filled with mutant beasts. However, as a base leader, Wu Chengyue could get whatever he wanted.</p> <p>However, the problem was that his daughter wouldn’t even look at those kittens and puppies he found for her. Once he put those animals in front of her, she would turn her head away.</p> <p>Well, he knew that his daughter could be single-minded sometimes…</p> <p>Wu Chengyue felt that the female zombie was quite special. He wondered if she had memories, and also if she was still a human being, or a half-human and half-zombie.</p> <p>He was also curious about what kind of food she lived on. Animals? He saw her drinking snake blood earlier on, so he wanted to know if she had eaten that giant snake entirely.</p> <p>While Wu Chengyue was sitting in his office, gazing at his daughter who was drawing with a pen and a paper, someone knocked on his door.</p> <p>He came back his senses and realized that he was actually distracted from work, because he was thinking about that strange female zombie.</p> <p>“Come in,” he said toward the closed door.</p> <p>The door was opened right away, and the tall and sturdy Xiao Yunlong walked in with some files. He put the files on Wu Chengyue’s table, then said to him, “Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming want to see you.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at him with surprise, then asked, “Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming? Aren’t they working for Zou? Why do they want to see me?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong shook his head and responded with, “You might have to ask them about that yourself.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was curious about that, and he wasn’t in the mood to continue doing his work at that moment, so he nodded and said, “Send them in.”</p> <p>“Send them in.” Xiao Yunlong turned to say to the guards outside the door. After that, two young and handsome men walked in.</p>",
  "Chapter 89: Brother And Sister": "<p>“Sorry for disturbing you,” Lu Tianyi walked in and greeted Wu Chengyue smilingly.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stood up from his seat and smilingly walked out from behind his desk while responding carelessly, “It’s alright! Take a seat. I heard that you went out of the base earlier. Have you just returned? Why are you in such a haste to see me? What happened?”</p> <p>While speaking, he pointed at the two-seater couch in his office. After that, he walked to the water filter to get a few cups of water, then turned back and put the water on the desk before the two young men.</p> <p>Next, he walked to his daughter, lifted her up and sat down, putting Wu Yueling on his knees.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming walked over and sat on the couch that he pointed at. Xiao Yunlong walked out, closing the door and then standing behind it.</p> <p>“We’re here to ask that… It might be a little… Well, you… Where did see Lu Tianyu for the last time?” When speaking of Lu Tianyu, Lu Tianyi felt a little uneasy. However, he still managed to say it out.</p> <p>He had to. He and Kong Qingming went out of the base to search for her body, but found nothing. They couldn’t tell if she had become a zombie and ran away, but they had checked the surrounding zombies and still failed to find her.</p> <p>Therefore, they had no choice but to come here and ask Wu Changyue if he knew where Lu Tianyu’s body was. After all, she had raped him. Even if Wu Chengyue didn’t care about what Lu Tianyu had done to him, he did care about his daughter.</p> <p>To their surprise, Wu Chengyue didn’t get angry as they thought he would. Instead, he responded calmly and smilingly with, “Can I ask a question?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi nodded.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked him up and down with surprise, then asked, “You’re from Zou’s side, but why are you asking about Yang Chao’s woman? Did you make the decision to come to ask me, or did Zou send you?”</p> <p>He meant that he wanted to know if Lu Tianyi asked that question for himself or for his boss.</p> <p>While speaking, Wu Chengyue continued looking at Lu Tianyi from head to toe. He had heard about Lu Tianyi; he didn’t know him well, but he had heard his name. The base was huge, with millions of people. Three level-three leaders were ruling the base together, so without a doubt, each of them had a large number of followers.</p> <p>Wu Yuecheng had heard about Lu Tianyi, but never seen him. Lu Tianyi had a different duty than he did, and lived rather far away from him; so, they didn’t have the chance to meet each other before.</p> <p>He didn’t think that Lu Tianyi would come to see him today. Now, seeing Lu Tianyi’s face, Wu Chengyue had some thoughts flashing across his mind. That was why he asked him that question,</p> <p>Lu Tianyi’s face darkened a little, but soon turned back normal. He looked at Wu Yuecheng in the eyes and said, “I know that the woman had done something… some indescribable thing to you. But, I’m not gonna hide our relationship from you. She’s my half-sister. We didn’t get along well when we were little, so after the apocalypse, we lived separately. But anyhow, half of her blood was the same as mine. So, even if she’s dead… I want her to rest in peace.”</p> <p>The smile on Wu Chengyue’s face was replaced by a knowing look. With surprise, he said, “So, she had a brother! You know what, I don’t care about what she did to me. But, she left Ling Ling in a very dangerous place, and that’s why I can’t forgive her. However, I’ve heard that she’s dead. Since she’s dead, I think I can let it go. If you only want to know where I saw her for the last time, that was in the T-Mall at the Morning Lane, Southern District.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi carefully listened to him, then memorized what he said. At that point, Kong Qingming abruptly began talking, “Chief Wu, we knew that Lu Tianyi left your little Ling Ling outside, but how did you find her? You had searched for Ling Ling for a long time after Lu Tianyu died, and during that time, Ling Ling was all alone. How did she manage to survive till you found her? I’m just really curious about that. Not even I can find out what happened! I feel that’s a miracle.”</p> <p>He was really curious. Kong Qingming was the leader of the intelligence department on Zou Shihui’s side, so no news could hide from him. However, he had failed to find even a clue about the missing body of Lu Tianyu, and the previously missing Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Kong Qingming looked like a lazy and carefree person, but every time he had a puzzle, he would fall into it until he had figured everything out. Otherwise, he would keep the unsolvable puzzle in mind, and wouldn’t even be able to sleep at night. Sometimes, he would even become a little neurotic.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue surely wouldn’t tell him about Lin Qiao. Not because that might affect her, but because that would definitely affect his daughter in a bad way.</p> <p>So, he smiled calmly and said, “Speaking of which, I’m also wondering what had happened to her out there. If Meng Yue didn’t have a special power, we might not have been able to find Ling Ling’s location. When we found her, she was left in a town far away from the city center. I think the ones who took her there were also human beings, so they took her with them the whole time. But, I don’t know why they didn’t show up when we arrived. I don’t even know who those people are.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue told a story which was half real and half made-up. He explained why Ling Ling didn’t die of starvation or in accidents. He pretended he didn’t see that female zombie, but told Kong Qingming that the ones who took Ling Ling to that town never showed up, so that the latter wouldn’t continue asking him about that, even though he wanted to know.</p> <p>Sometimes, the best way to keep something secret was to know nothing about it.</p> <p>Ling Ling wouldn’t talk, so Kong Qingming and Lu Tianyi would never be able to get an answer from her. Actually, if they manage to make Ling Ling talk, Wu Chengyue would feel somewhat happy about that.</p> <p>Hearing his words, Kong Qingming was lost in thoughts. Gradually, he believed in that story as he felt that Wu Chengyue’s words did make sense,</p> <p>“Chief Wu, we’ve actually been to that mall you mentioned. We’ve searched through the area ten miles around it, but found nothing. However, I do know one thing, that Lin Yong and the other two were killed by your people. I’m thinking that you must have asked those three people some questions before killing them, right?” Lu Tianyi said.</p> <p>The meaning of his words was clear. He knew that Wu Chengyue had sent his people to catch Lin Yong and the other two. As for why did he do that, that must because he wanted to ask them about where Lu Tianyu was. Therefore, he believed that those three people had told him something before their deaths.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue thought for a moment, then said, “Ah, you’re talking about the three who used to follow Lu Tianyu around to protect her, right? They were taken care of by my deputy chief, Xiao Yunlong. He hasn’t told me what exactly happened yet. I’ll tell him to come in, then you can ask him directly.”</p> <p>He had been dealing with official businesses since he returned, so Xiao Yunlong had prepared to wait until he finished the most important works of his, and then report to him about that small personal matter in details. But, the latter did mention it to him earlier on.</p> <p>After saying that, he turned to shout at the door, “Cheng, go tell the deputy chief to come back.”</p>",
  "Chapter 90: Thirty Percent Like Each Other": "<p>“Yes, sir,” Cheng’s voice was heard from outside the door, followed by a series of footsteps.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming while speaking, “He hasn’t told me the details regarding how he dealt with those three people, so I don’t know much about it yet. You’re gonna have to wait for him to come over and answer your questions.”</p> <p>Fortunately, Xiao Yunlong hadn’t gone far, so he was back in two minutes. He knocked the door and walked in, then looked at the people in the office and asked, “You wanted to see me?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue pointed at an armchair and said, “You had finished those three people off before returning to the base, right? These two have some questions to ask you.” While speaking, he pointed at Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong didn’t directly sit down after coming in, but walked to the water filter to get himself a cup of water. After that, he held the cup and walked back to sit into the armchair.</p> <p>He looked at Lu Tianyi with a strange expression, then asked abruptly, “Can I ask you a question? Are you Lu Tianyu’s long lost brother?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi felt a little speechless. Wu Chengyue and Kong Qingming couldn’t help but laugh.</p> <p>“Not long lost. I am her brother. Do we look alike?” Said Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong took a sip of the water and nodded while saying, “Em… about thirty percent.”</p> <p>In fact, he had met Lu Tianyi before Lu Tianyu. Lu Tianyu’s thick makeup covered her real face, but Xiao Yunlong still felt a little strange after seeing her for a few times. Back then, he didn’t pay any attention to that or try to figure out why; but now, he had that feeling again when he was looking at Lu Tianyi closely.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi sighed and continued, “We don’t really look alike. But, Deputy Chief does have sharp eyes.”</p> <p>He was actually trying to say that Lu Tianyu might have looked more like him if she removed her thick makeup.</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Chengyue looked at Xiao Yunlong and said, “You dealt with Lin Yong and the other two superpowered ones yourself. Before that, did you verify any info about that wo… Em, about Lu Tianyu?”</p> <p>He was going to say ‘that woman’ in dislike, but changed his words on seeing Lu Tianyi’s face.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong nodded and responded, “Those three got Lu Tianyu killed. You should have known that already, so I won’t say much about it. I’ve sent my people to the place that Lin Yong told me, and my people have found some traces indeed. However, they didn’t see her body.”</p> <p>If Lu Tianyu were eaten by zombies, her body might be torn into pieces, but her skull and some bones should have remained. However, Xiao Yunlong’s people failed to find even a finger of hers.</p> <p>Kong Qingming rubbed his delicate chin as he pondered for a few seconds, then suddenly asked, “Could she have become a zombie?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Lu Tianyi both turned to Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong shook his head and denied that possibility, “That shouldn’t be possible. That could only happen when she was wounded by zombies, then hid in a zombie-free area. But, according to Lin Yong and the other two, they threw Lu Tianyu out after they killed her. So, she was very likely to be eaten by zombies.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi’s face dropped slightly as he remained silent. Kong Qingming thought for a while and said, “So where’s her body?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong looked at him and said, “I didn’t think that you two are really related. Is she really your sister?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi raised his head to look at Xiao Yunlong, then nodded slightly.</p> <p>Seeing Lu Tianyi’s grim face, Kong Qingming explained for him, “She was his half-sister. Because of their complicated family relationship, they didn’t get along well in the old world. But in fact, Tianyi has been keeping an eye on her since the apocalypse. But, something went wrong this time, and we didn’t get the message timely.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong nodded and said, “That woman… Em, it might be unpleasant to hear, but Yang Chao didn’t want her anymore, and other men did not want to have her either. Besides, that woman had her eyes on his enemy… Hm, that was enough to make him jealous. She risked her own life to try hurting our Chief, so Yang Chao took the opportunity to kill her. He has spread the word that it was us who threw Lu Tianyu into a zombie crowd, right?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong sneered while speaking, his gaze was sharp.</p> <p>At that point, almost everyone in the base who knew about what happened to Lu Tianyu thought that she was killed by Chief Wu’s people, as easily as killing an ant, because she had offended Chief Wu.</p> <p>They believed that Chief Wu and his people wouldn’t get soft-hearted, even though she was a beautiful woman.</p> <p>Only a few people who saw things extra clearly knew that she was abandoned and killed by Yang Chao.</p> <p>“That’s about all we know. The rest you can only find out by yourself. I’m sorry that we can’t be more helpful. We haven’t done you much help actually,” Wu Chengyue said to Lu Tianyi as an apology.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi hurriedly waved his hand and said smilingly, “You shouldn’t be sorry at all. We should apologize for disturbing you. And, Deputy Chief’s information is very useful to us. So, Chief, we should leave and stop wasting your time. We still have things to do.”</p> <p>While he was speaking, he and Kong Qingming stood up, prepared to leave.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue remained sitting in his seat while holding Wu Yueling. He raised his head to smile at Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming, then said, “That’s alright. So, see you later.”</p> <p>After the two young men walked out of the office and closed the door, Wu Chengyue turned to Xiao Yunlong and asked, “Did you really not see her body?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong looked at Wu Chengyue without answering the question. Then, he turned his eyes to Wu Yueling, who was sitting on her father’s knees, and said, “Eh? Why isn’t Lin Ling afraid of me today?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling was sitting in Wu Chengyue’s arms quietly. However, once she sensed Xiao Yunlong’s gaze, she turned to hold Wu Chengyue, with her back toward Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>‘I just said that you’re not afraid me of today…’ thought Xiao Yunlong with some exasperation.</p> <p>He had noticed Wu Yueling once he came in. Before, he couldn’t even see the little girl’s face, because she didn’t dare to look at anyone other than her father!</p> <p>However, he had sat here for over a minute today, and the little girl had been staring at her hands or feet the whole while. Even though she still didn’t dare to raise her head and look at his face, it was already unusual for her.</p> <p>Besides, two strangers were also in the office, but the child still didn’t turn to hold her father tightly.</p> <p>That was unusual!</p> <p>Nevertheless, when he pointed that out, the little girl reacted immediately, as if someone had turned on her switch!</p> <p>Hearing Xiao Yunlong, Wucheng Yue’s expression changed slightly. Then, he stared at him, his eyes glowing.</p> <p>Earlier on, he hadn’t been paying attention to his daughter when talking to Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming. But now, as Xiao Yunlong mentioned it, he sensed it right away.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at his daughter happily. He put his hands under her arms to drag her away from his chest, then said to her, “Ling Ling, you’re not afraid of Uncle Yunlong anymore, are you?”</p>",
  "Chapter 91: Believe It Or Not": "<p>Wu Yueling didn’t respond, but turned her head to an empty area.</p> <p>“Ling Ling?” Wu Chengyue didn’t give up. He shook her gently and called her name.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong stood up and circled to before Wu Yueling’s face, then squatted and prepared to talk to her. However, before he could start, she turned again without saying a word to him.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong felt speechless. ‘Alright, the same old Ling Ling again,’ he thought.</p> <p>Seeing that his daughter had turned back into that familiar state, Wu Chengyue sighed with disappointment and said, “I wonder how she got along with that zombie. That creature was so ugly, but Ling Ling didn’t seem to be afraid of her.”</p> <p>Speaking of that weird zombie, Xiao Yunlong got interested. He stood up and walked back to his seat, then sat down. “Eh? Tell me about that zombie. Earlier on, you just roughly mentioned it to me. I don’t know how that non-human-eating zombie looked like yet. How ugly is she?” He asked.</p> <p>When Wu Chengyue returned to the base, he only told Xiao Yunlong that it was a zombie who took Ling Ling away, but didn’t mention anything else.</p> <p>He held Wu Yueling back in his arm, then looked at Xiao Yunlong and said, “Her face was covered in an afro, so I couldn’t see it clearly. But, I saw the scars on his face, as large as her eyes, covering her entire face. She was wearing a clean military training suit, looking quite capable. Of course, to notice that, you need to forget about her face and afro.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong pictured that zombie in his mind and felt a little weird.</p> <p>“You turned her hair into an afro! No wonder she took your daughter so far away! I told you that she had no bad intentions. Perhaps, she was sending Ling Ling back to you at that time.” Said Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and responded with, “Back then, I just attacked automatically. I didn’t mean to hurt her. But, I didn’t think that she’d hold the grudge. She even made me apologize.”</p> <p>“What? Apologize? She made you apologize? Are you sure that you’re talking about a zombie? Not a human being?” Xiao Yunlong gave a start and asked. He thought he had misheard.</p> <p>Seeing the confused look in Xiao Yunlong’s face, Wu Chengyue nodded smilingly. Xiao Yunlong again felt speechless.</p> <p>“How did she tell you to… apologize? Can you understand zombie roars?” Xiao Yunlong recovered from the shock and asked in surprise. While speaking, he was also picturing that zombie roaring at Wu Chengyue to make him apologize.</p> <p>He wanted to laugh, but couldn’t tell why, so the look on his face had become very strange. Seeing that strange look, Wu Chengyue said, “Just laugh if you want to. Why do you have to keep a straight face?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong made a fist before his mouth of cover his expression, then said, “Em-hem… I was just picturing that zombie roaring at you. That’s a little weird. So, how did you know that she wanted you to apologize?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at him with a smile and responded, “Who told you that she roared? She can write!”</p> <p>“Em, write? That sounds more like it… Eh? Wait a moment! She can write?” Xiao Yunlong exclaimed as he registered the meaning behind the words.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Write? Is that still a zombie?’ </em>Xiao Yunlong thought.</p> <p>“Isn’t she a zombie?” Xiao Yunlong spent two seconds to process what he had heard, and then paused briefly while staring at Wu Chengyue in disbelief. He felt that it wasn’t right, so he asked, “It’s not a joke, is it?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave him a mysterious smile and just shrugged. ‘She is a zombie, but she still has her human memories and humanity!’ he thought.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong’s face was still filled with disbelief. He stared at Wu Chengyue, even showing a little scorn as he said, “A zombie which can write? Do you think that I’m silly? How can a zombie write?”</p> <p>All zombies were supposed to lose their humanity, mind, and souls. They were like monsters, with only their instinctive desire to feed on human beings and wander purposelessly.</p> <p>How could that kind of creature do something that only human beings were capable of?</p> <p>If that wasn’t a joke, what was it?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue remained silent and just smiled faintly. However, Wu Yueling, who had her face buried in her father’s chest, now suddenly turned back to glance at Xiao Yunlong, then quickly buried her head back into Wu Chengyue’s arms.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue couldn’t see the look in his daughter’s face, but Xiao Yunlong, who sat in front of him, saw it and then fell silent.</p> <p>‘Little Ling Ling, please explain that disdainful look on your face!’ Xiao Yunlong paused slightly when he noticed Wu Yueling’s expression, then shouted in his head.</p> <p>The little girl never talked to him before, but just now, she suddenly threw him a cute but disdainful glance. Xiao Yunlong even began to feel that she had started becoming a little annoying! She was no longer adorable!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at him smilingly and said, “You can go and find out if you don’t believe me. But, why should I lie to you? If you’re going, I need to warn you that just don’t let her scare you.”</p> <p>Imagining the tall and sturdy Xiao Yunlong being scared by that zombie’s human-like behavior, Wu Chengyue’s smile grew slightly brighter.</p> <p>Xiao Yun rolled his eyes and said scornfully, “I could tell that the female zombie had no hostility toward us. But, if you’re telling me that she can write… please stop joking.”</p> <p>Wo Chengyue rolled his eyes and then said, “Believe it or not.”<br/>\n…</p> <p>Lin Qiao who had been heading South, had no idea that some people were looking for the body that she was using at the moment. Neither did she know that the people that she was looking for had brushed past her, and were moving in another direction, further and further away from her.</p> <p>Qiu Lili’s vibe was way stronger than Lin Qiao’s, and could spread widely. If she wanted to, she could let the zombies within two miles in radius sense her.</p> <p>She had been restraining her vibe and keeping the range of its influence narrow. However, the zombies within four-hundred meters around them could still feel her.</p> <p>Therefore, all the roads had been quite unobstructed for Lin Qiao, as the surrounding zombies would all move away automatically once her car approached.</p> <p>So, she had increased her driving speed. Soon, she drove past Quan Zhou and arrived at Zhang Zhou.</p> <p>Zhang Zhou was quite close to Hades Base, which was one of the two Southern bases. Therefore, she planned to go to the Hades Base first and see if she could find any useful information. Although, she understood well that finding her family wouldn’t be easy.</p> <p>Besides, because of her current appearance, she had no way of getting into the base and to simply ask around. Without a doubt, she wouldn’t be able to enter the base.</p> <p>So, she planned first look for the people who were from the Hades Base, and sneakily approach them to see if she could hear anything useful.</p> <p>Only if she could have her own body back!</p>",
  "Chapter 92: Energy And Energy": "<p>While driving, Lin Qiao was thinking about how should she obtain the news about Lin Feng and her other family members. She didn’t know if they were in the Hades Base. They might be in another base, or they might have left already…</p> <p>The good thing was that she had as much time as she needed. Even though the final result could be bad, she still wanted a result.</p> <p>If she could restore her look…</p> <p>Suddenly, she had an idea and she automatically pressed on the break. The car stopped abruptly, and the inertia made both her and Qiu Lili lean forward.</p> <p>Qiu Lili reacted quickly. She immediately supported her body with her hands, then turned to look at Lin Qiao in confusion. She didn’t know why the latter had suddenly stopped the car like this.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t spare her attention for Qiu Lili at that moment, because she was recalling her experience down in the middle of the lake in her space.</p> <p>She remembered that after she came out of the lake, the wounds on her lower legs were mostly healed, and her lost flesh had regrown. If the lake water could restore her look, finding her family would become much easier for her.</p> <p>However, she didn’t make the decision herself to go down into the lake the last time, and instead was summoned down there. So, she didn’t know if those energy vines would show up again and help restore her body when she took her initiative to go down.</p> <p>After stopping the car, Lin Qiao turned back and got off the car without saying a word to Qiu Lili. In the next moment, she disappeared right beside the car.</p> <p><em>‘What happened? Eh?’ </em>Qiu Lili was left in confusion.</p> <p>After entering her space, Lin Qiao stood beside the lake. She first looked at the lake, then glanced around. She didn’t see Junjun, but could sense her vibe; the latter was in still that small space.</p> <p>She turned back and took off her clothes. If those energy vines really showed up, her clothes would disappear anyway.</p> <p>Lin Qiao would bathe in the lake every day. Her body couldn’t carry out metabolism, but could still get dirty. The outside world was awfully dusty, so after spending a day out there, she would always be covered in dust.</p> <p>In the harsh post-apocalyptic world, being able to bathe every day was an extremely luxurious thing. Only the base leaders and the capable people could afford to do that.</p> <p>After taking off her clothes, Lin Qiao glanced at her lower legs. Her lower legs now looked already like that of healthy human beings, just with a different color. Her unwounded skin was bluish white, while the newly grown skin was bright white.</p> <p>The difference between her two skin colors was quite apparent.</p> <p>She then looked at the wounds on her thighs. While bathing, she had slowly ripped off the scabs there and exposed the newly grown flesh. However, the surface of her thighs was still rough.</p> <p>As for her stomach and chest… She should better not look there, as her intestines would always fall out.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her head and took a deep breath, then walked into the lake.</p> <p>At that moment, she was recalling what had happened the last time. Back then, her mind wasn’t clear, as if she was summoned by something. She felt nothing at first, but when she reached the bottom of the lake and was wrapped up by the vines, her mind was clear again.</p> <p>Her heart sank a little when she thought about suffering that unbearable pain and brain-exploding feeling without being able to pass out. However, she still walked forward.</p> <p>At first, she was walking on hard rocks. But, she didn’t feel uncomfortable as her feet were dead, and could barely feel a thing.</p> <p>After going down to the lake, the buoyancy of water began holding her up. She thrust her feet against the lake bottom and started swimming.</p> <p>The lake was not large, so she soon swam to the center. However, after floating in the lake for a while, she suddenly didn’t know what to do.</p> <p>Earlier on, after she saw the energy flowing inside that little boy’s body, she had come back to her space to check the lake. Back then, she was able to see the large area of glowing greenness in the middle of the lake. The nearer to the center she got, the brighter it was, as if a certain amount of fluorescent liquid was gathered together. The further from the lake center she got, the fainter the color was.</p> <p>Only after what happened down in the middle of the lake was she able to see that green light.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was now floating above that greenness, but no green vines were showing up at the time. She dove down into the water, toward the center of the lake bottom; but, a strange buoyancy had been stopping her from reaching the bottom.</p> <p>Therefore, she had no choice but to float in the lake, trying to figure out a way to dive down.</p> <p>The water was very clear and glowing. However, she could see nothing but the green light.</p> <p>‘How should I go down? How to make those green vines wrap me again? Why did it happen the last time?’ Lin Qiao floated in the lake, pondering over these questions while recalling what happened the last time.</p> <p>She thought about it over and over again, yet couldn’t figure out a thing. But suddenly, she sensed some energy waves from the lake bottom. Then, she saw a finger-thick green vine wriggling out of the green light like a snake. It was so long that she couldn’t see the other end of it. The only thing she saw was it reaching up then gently coiling around her ankle.</p> <p>Suddenly, a message emerged from her mind.</p> <p><em>‘The energy isn’t enough, so the energy can’t be triggered!’ </em></p> <p>Once Lin Qiao received that message, the vine uncoiled from her ankle and quickly drew back down.</p> <p>She started thinking about that message.</p> <p><em>‘The energy isn’t enough, so the energy can’t be triggered’ </em>… What did it mean? She knew that the second ‘energy’ referred to the green light underneath her, but what was the first ‘energy’?</p> <p>Was that her own energy? She was a zombie without great superpowers. If she did have a superpower, it should be her space, shouldn’t it? But, she hadn’t sensed any kind of energy from herself yet, had she?</p> <p>Or… As she was a zombie, should she replenish her own energy with the nuclei of other zombies?</p> <p>She then recalled that she hadn’t been fighting any other zombies for quite a while, or getting any zombie nuclei. Did that vine just tell her to first fill herself with energy, then come back to the lake?</p> <p>The more she thought that way, the more she felt that it was right. In that case, she now knew how to find the answer!</p> <p>With that thought, she immediately swam toward the lakeside.</p> <p>Junjun was standing the entrance of the small space, looking at her curiously.</p> <p>She had sensed Lin Qiao’s vibe once the latter came in, so she came out to take a look. Then, she found that the latter had taken off her clothes and jumped into the lake.</p> <p>She first thought that Lin Qiao was going for a bath, then saw the latter begin swimming. But after that, Lin Qiao strangely stopped in the middle of the lake and quietly floated there. She couldn’t figure out what Lin Qiao was doing in the lake, but was quite curious; so, she remained standing by the entrance of the small space and looking at Lin Qiao.</p>",
  "Chapter 93: Hunt Zombies": "<p>After coming ashore, Lin Qiao walked toward the small space while getting dressed.</p> <p>She didn’t wear a bra, but that wasn’t important anymore. Her breasts had been eaten, so what did she need a bra for? At first, she felt very weird, like a breast cancer patient who had her breasts cut off. However, she gradually got used to it.</p> <p>Her body condition wouldn’t get worse anyway.</p> <p>When she walked to the entrance of the small space, the little boy walked out. While shambling around Junjun’s legs, the boy suddenly saw the approaching Lin Qiao. So, he immediately stopping moving forward, then turned and ran.</p> <p>He rushed to the bed, then climbed onto it with all fours and crawled into the blanket, covering his head with the blanket.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t even know if the boy was afraid of her or simply didn’t like her.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! I’ve been providing this little thing food and a place to live, but he has turned out to be ungrateful!’ </em>Thought Lin Qiao. She cooked snake soup and picked strawberries for him to eat, but he didn’t even dare to look at her.</p> <p><em>‘You little coward!’ </em>She complained silently. <em>‘Wu Yueling had nothing to eat but strawberries when she lived here. But after a while, that little girl stopped being afraid of me. She even tried to protect me. You’re so not like her, you little ungrateful soul!’</em></p> <p>Junjun glanced at the little boy, wanting to laugh. But still, she turned to Lin Qiao to ask her questions with her eyes, as she was really curious about the latter’s strange behavior in the lake.</p> <p><em>‘Do you wanna go out for some fresh air? </em>‘ Lin Qiao took out the notepad and wrote.</p> <p>Junjun glanced at the little boy, then thought of that young female zombie outside. After that, she shook her head decisively. After Lin Qiao told her that the young female zombie outside was a zombie queen, Junjun was even more afraid of going out.</p> <p>She was instinctively afraid of Qiu Lili.</p> <p>But in the meanwhile, she was curious about why Lin Qiao, who was also a zombie, didn’t feel anything when facing Qiu Lili. She even wondered if Lin Qiao was also at level-six.</p> <p>But then, she denied that possibility as Lin Qiao could only make her follow orders and disable her from fighting back, but had never given her a feeling of instinctive fear.</p> <p>Therefore, it wasn’t possible for Lin Qiao to be a level-six zombie, even though Junjun felt that she was very mysterious and strong.</p> <p>As Junjun refused to go out, Lin Qiao gave up on inviting her, then disappeared from where she was.</p> <p>Qiu Lili was getting bored outside, and was circling around the car. Suddenly, she paused and turned her head, seeing Lin Qiao show up right beside the car.</p> <p>“Aw-goro…” She still liked to make some strange sounds with her mouth to talk to Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘What happened to you? Why did you stop the car and enter your space suddenly? Did anything happen there?’ </em>She asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head, then took out the notepad and wrote—’I went in to confirm something.’</p> <p>Qiu Lili didn’t ask any more questions, just said ‘Aw’ and then sat back inside the car.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat back in the driver’s seat, then wrote her another sentence—’I’ll postpone my journey to the Hades Base. Right now, I need to hunt zombies.’</p> <p><em>‘Hunt zombies?’ </em>Qiu Lili turned to look at her in confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and then wrote— <em>‘Can you make your vibe disappear? Or, you’ll scare away all my preys.’</em></p> <p>Qiu Lili looked at her with wide opened eyes, then gave her a roar.<br/>\n‘Do you need me to control some zombies for you and make them come over?’ She asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head. She didn’t want help, because she intended to try her current fighting capacity. However, she felt that she could ask Qiu Lili to locate high-level zombies for her.</p> <p>Qiu Lili nodded, then closed her eyes and raised her head while taking a deep breath. Then, Lin Qiao felt that the former’s vibe disappeared completely. Not to mention the other surrounding zombies, not even Lin Qiao herself could sense Qiu Lili at the moment, even though the latter was sitting right next to her.</p> <p>She nodded in satisfaction, then drove toward the city center. To hunt zombies, she needed to choose the crowded city center. To get high-quality zombie nuclei, she needed to find high-level zombies.</p> <p>Actually, she had two high-level zombies right on top of her car, but she couldn’t kill them as they were Qiu Lili’s servants.</p> <p>Without Qiu Lili’s strong vibe, the road before Lin Qiao was again full of obstacles. Those ordinary zombies were like a group of cows which blocked the way. She tried to drive them away, but they moved too slowly…</p> <p>The closer they got to the downtown area, the more loitering zombies she saw. At last, Lin Qiao gave up driving. She parked on the road and got off, putting the car back into her space before walking toward the city center.</p> <p>“Roar?”<br/>\n‘What level of the zombies do you want?’ Qiu Lili asked, who was by her side. Lin Qiao glanced at her, then showed her four fingers.</p> <p>Qiu Lili nodded, then raised her head to sniff in the air.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t sense higher level zombies. Currently, she was only able to sense the zombies at level-three or below, and her range wasn’t large.</p> <p>After a quick sniff, Qiu Lili pointed at one direction. She had found a target already.</p> <p>Lin Qiao immediately walked that way while Qiu Lili followed behind her carelessly. She had been jumping around, looking for large stones to step on. She hadn’t changed her white dress, but that dress had been kept quite clean these days.</p> <p>After walking on a street, which was covered by stones and sands and surrounded by broken building, for a few minutes, Lin Qiao finally sensed a vibe. The owner of the vibe was slightly stronger than her, but hadn’t yet reached level-five.</p> <p>No other zombies existed in this area. This place was all clean, without even a single ordinary zombie.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked forward slowly in the middle of the way. She moved at a very slow pace, eyes focused on her own feet, as if she were having a leisurely time. It seemed that she was here to take a walk instead of hunting zombies.</p> <p>As she expected, in less than two minutes, a figure silently leaped down from the building behind her, diving straight down toward her back. That creature’s metal-lustered claws stabbed directly at the back of her head.</p> <p>It was swift, but so was Lin Qiao. She had sensed the enemy when it was diving down from the air. As the enemy was less than two meters away from her, she suddenly disappeared from where she was.</p> <p>The figure missed its target, landed on the ground. It stood there and looked around in confusion.</p> <p>It was a female zombie; its hair were as disheveled as Lin Qiao’s, covering its head. Its face under the hair wasn’t clearly visible, but Lin Qiao saw its purely dark eyes and widely cracked mouth.</p> <p>That zombie had a stench. Its whole body had been radiating evilness, ferocity, the intent of killing, and the thirst for blood.</p> <p>It widely opened its black eyes and opened its cracked mouth to bare its sharp teeth while looking around. However, it failed to find a trace of Lin Qiao.</p> <p>It had no idea that Lin Qiao was right behind it at the moment.</p>",
  "Chapter 94: The Confrontation On Top of the Building": "<p>Just now, Lin Qiao entered her space and came out in just a moment, but in her invisible state. After that, she silently circled to behind the level-four female zombie.</p> <p>In the next second, she flashed into her space again and came out immediately. Meanwhile, she cut at the back of the female zombie’s neck with her claws.</p> <p>However, the female zombie in front of her sensed her the moment she came out of her space and squatted swiftly. Right before the air blade produced by Lin Qiao’s claws touched its skin, it nimbly dodged the attack.</p> <p>While squatting, it weirdly turned its body and moved to one side of Lin Qiao, then swung its claws at Lin Qiao’s ear, attempting to cut her head off. Its claws brought up a sharp gust of wind while attacking fiercely.</p> <p>Lin Qiao reacted fast as well. However, the wind caused by her enemy’s claws had a massive attack range. She had sensed how sharp that wind was, so she knew that she’d fall in trouble if she let it touch her body.</p> <p>The wind blew very fast, so Lin Qiao had no choice but to flash into her space and come back out in the invisible state to continue staying around the female zombie safely.</p> <p>She didn’t think that the female zombie could react so fast, that it sensed her the moment she showed up. Moreover, it was swift and had wind power!</p> <p>So, how should she fight this battle? She thought for a second and realized that although she was able to do close combat and cut the enemy with her claws, she had no weapons. Should she bring out the gun? That would be useless without a doubt. Judging by how quickly the female zombie could react, Lin Qiao estimated that only hand grenades or bombs could hurt it. A gun? She was afraid that the flying bullets would be blown away by the female zombie’s wind.<br/>\nShe didn’t have any highly destructive weapons at the moment, so she needed to think of another way to deal with the female zombie. If it was close combat, she felt that she had a great chance of winning, because she had mastered all sorts of combat skills, and her claws were as sharp as the enemy’s. But, the problem was that she wasn’t able to get close to that female zombie at that point.</p> <p>After launching a claw attack with the wind power, the female zombie found that Lin Qiao had disappeared again. So, it immediately gathered the wind and made it blow around its own body, making its ragged clothes flutter and rustle.</p> <p>Its skin was dry and brown, as if all the moisture of its body had been drained. Its muscles looked like loft-dried meat pieces. It did not look even like a normal zombie.</p> <p>The female zombie was very alert. It was standing still, but its eyes were rolling quickly, as if it was trying to sense Lin Qiao’s movements.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gently stepped onto a large rock nearby and stared at the female zombie, thinking about how to consume its power up.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao was even able to see the zombie virus and the superpower energy inside the female zombie’s body. As the female zombie was using its power, she saw a cloudy greenness filling every corner of its body.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the rock under her feet, and suddenly had an idea.</p> <p>That rock was a part of a stone wall, seeming to be from the house next to it. Lin Qiao leaped down and directly showed her face, uttering a provocative roar toward the female zombie.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n“Come and hit me!” She said.</p> <p>The female zombie turned its body and fixed its eyes on Lin Qiao. It knew that it might not be able to win in close combat against Lin Qiao, because the latter was a master of escaping, and would disappear at any moment. Therefore, it didn’t prepare to pounce on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Roar!” However, it still gave Lin Qiao an angry roar and hunched its back, looking like a raging beast.</p> <p>In the next moment, the wind above its head blew toward Lin Qiao. The wind grew greater and greater, sharper and sharper, even cutting off the trees by the roadside. The broken tree trunks were rolled up by the wind and shredded before falling back to the ground.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back. However, she didn’t enter her space this time, but rushed into a building nearby which had over ten floors and ran upstairs.</p> <p>The wind immediately blew at the building, then expanded and began to wrap the entire tall building, forming a whirlwind. It spiraled at an extremely high speed around the building, generating a strange noise.</p> <p>After running upstairs, Lin Qiao found that no wind had been blowing into the building from the doors and windows. However, she could still hear it screaming very loudly. She glanced outside and saw the drifting sand and stones. The wind had been bringing up some light-weight objects to fly around the building.</p> <p>The wind was growing stronger, and spiraling faster.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked around and saw the same scene. It seemed that the female zombie had wrapped the entire building with her wind, as if it wanted to create a tornado and tear the building down. The female zombie believed that when the tornado shattered the building entirely, Lin Qiao would die as well.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao didn’t worry about her own situation, but kept running up. The building only had ten floors, and Lin Qiao was running quite fast. So, within the span of a few breaths, she rushed to the top of the building.</p> <p>Once she arrived at the roof, she found that the tornado had ripped off some of the building’s outer wall. The four strong, triangular areas of the building were slowly smoothened by the wind.</p> <p>She didn’t expect this wind-powered zombie to be strong enough to create such a great tornado, and to be so full of energy. She stood near the stairs, looking at the roaring wind around her. Suddenly, a figure flew up and floated in the air, staring at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao immediately turned her eyes toward it, and saw the female zombie treading upon a small whirlwind.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave a start when seeing that.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! That looks cool! Do you have to stand on a whirlwind and look down at me?’</em>She thought.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hadn’t sensed the female zombie’s vibe, maybe because it was blocked by the tornado. She quietly watched the tornado tearing off the outer walls of the building bit by bit, and the stones and ashes flying in the sky.</p> <p>She stood there calmly, looking at her enemy in the eyes.</p> <p>It might be the way Lin Qiao looked which made the female zombie angrier and angrier.</p> <p>It believed that Lin Qiao was here for either her territory or her zombie nucleus, so it was already raging when it saw her. But in addition to that, Lin Qiao’s composure annoyed it in some way.</p> <p>Therefore, it stared at straight Lin Qiao, its gaze turning sharper and sharper. It opened its mouth and bared its dirty yet shiny teeth toward the latter.</p> <p>Lin Qiao made completely no reaction to its threat, only looking back at it calmly. She even gave it a sarcastic smile, as if saying, <em>‘What can you possibly do to me? Attack me?’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 95: The Vines’ Absorption": "<p>The level-four zombie was intelligent, but wasn’t so smart. After being challenged by Lin Qiao, its anger couldn’t help but flare up.</p> <p>It believed that Lin Qiao came into its territory to start trouble, and was actually disdaining it. She was clearly weaker than it, so how could she mock it like that?</p> <p>The female zombie felt being underestimated by Lin Qiao. That irritable feeling grew stronger and stronger, urging it to rush up and tear the latter into pieces directly. However, its mind had been telling it not to do that.</p> <p>Therefore, the female zombie reached out both her hands to release more energy for the tornado, which grew stronger and stronger. However, it had no idea that it was exactly what Lin Qiao had wanted. Seeing the wall falling off the building in small pieces, she just kept waiting.</p> <p>She was observing the female zombie’s energy consumption. She found that its energy hadn’t been consuming fast, and it was still able to float stably in the air. It seemed that it had hunted a lot of other zombies and absorbed a large amount of energy.</p> <p>The consumption rate of the female zombie’s energy was way too slow. If the situation carried on, its energy could even last until tomorrow morning.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought briefly, then suddenly had an idea. She recalled that for some reason, Xie Dong had jumped into the lake in her space after turning into a zombie, then soon floated back up quietly.</p> <p>So, she now wondered if any effect would happen if she directly led the female zombie into the lake. After all, her space was capable of blocking the energy from the outside world. She had earth, water, and grasses in her space, but no wind.</p> <p>The female zombie had wind power, but to create a great destructive wind, it still needed to borrow the natural wind for a start, then strengthen it with its own power. Therefore, Lin Qiao estimated that the female zombie’s wind power wouldn’t be highly harmful to her in her space.</p> <p>She wanted to try and find out if her space could launch attacks or even kill zombies! If it could, all she would be needing to do for her future battles was sneakily get her enemies into the space when she failed to defeat them!</p> <p>With that thought, Lin Qiao got a little excited and jumped into action right away. Under the female zombie’s gaze, she flashed into the space, switched to the invisible state, and came back out. However, she didn’t go downstairs, but stayed where she was to observe the female zombie.</p> <p>Her invisible state disabled her from attacking, but also enabled her for ignoring the attacks of the enemy. Once she turned invisible, she couldn’t feel the tornado anymore; she didn’t even have any sense of danger.</p> <p>As she disappeared, the female zombie floating in the air paused briefly, then let out a raging roar and waved both arms.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>A thunderous roaring of wind was heard, along with a series of weird noises caused when heavy objects fell to the ground. Under the female zombie’s control, the tornado was suddenly boosted and sped up, to the point where Lin Qiao could no longer measure the wind speed with her eyes. She saw that the concrete on the surface of the entire building had been ripped off, and all the doors and windows had been blown away.</p> <p>Before long, only the twisted rebars were left of the building.</p> <p>The female zombie looked around. After failing to sense Lin Qiao’s vibe, it immediately drifted to the top of the damaged building and found a flat area to stand on.</p> <p>It lowered its head to look into the building and search for Lin Qiao’s traces, but saw and sensed nothing. It didn’t know that the invisible Lin Qiao was standing less than a meter away from it.</p> <p>Seeing the female zombie stop on top of the building, Lin Qiao quietly approached it. Next, she suddenly grabbed its hand and flashed swiftly into her space. At that moment, the two zombies on top of the building disappeared together from where they were.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was able to show up in anywhere in her space, so when she caught the female zombie, she directly brought it into the lake, down in the water.</p> <p>Once in, Lin Qiao let go of the female zombie and swam backward reflexively.</p> <p>From grabbing the female zombie to flashing into her, space then to loosening her hands and swimming backward, Lin Qiao spent no more than two seconds in this whole series of moves.</p> <p>Therefore, the female zombie didn’t manage to react when its wrist was suddenly gripped by Lin Qiao. It only felt that its eyes were dazzled, and the scene before its eyes changed. Next, it saw nothing but dark-green water, without knowing where it was.</p> <p>It realized what was happening only when Lin Qiao let go of her. It felt that its body was sinking, so it began struggling in a panic. However, it had never tried swimming, so no matter how hard it swung its limbs in the water, all its efforts were useless.</p> <p>Fortunately, as a zombie, it didn’t need to breathe. However, the feeling of being wrapped by the water without being able to put forth its strength frightened it badly.</p> <p>It tried to release its power, but found that its wind power could deliver no other effects underwater than starting waves of strange ripples.</p> <p>Lin Qiao, who had drawn back for a short distance, saw the female zombie amidst the glow of the lake water. She saw it struggling like an animal which didn’t know how to swim while sinking slowly.</p> <p>She also saw it use its power. However, in Lin Qiao’s eyes, the superpower energy released from the female zombie’s palms soon melted in the green light of the lake water.</p> <p>She watched the scene with surprise, as she didn’t expect the lake to be so powerful.</p> <p>The lake was like an invincible opponent for the female zombie, because nothing changed no matter how hard it tried to fight back!</p> <p>While Lin Qiao was excitedly watching the female zombie struggling and sinking in the water, she suddenly sensed an energy wave from the lake bottom. After that, she saw countless familiar vines reaching up toward the female zombie one after another. Before long, the vines had wrapped the female zombie entirely up. Instead of dragging it down, the vines directly wrapped the female zombie into a giant human-shaped cocoon.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at those vines in shock. After the vines caught the female zombie, the energy inside the zombie’s body began leaking and being absorbed by the vines.</p> <p>Lin Qiao drifted in the water, watching the vines absorb the female zombie’s energy. Half an hour later, she finally sensed that the energy contained in the female zombie’s body had been drained thoroughly.</p> <p>After that, the vines threw the zombie upward, like throwing away a bag of garbage. At that point, Lin Qiao could no longer sense the female zombie’s vibe anymore.</p> <p>The zombie’s body slowly floated up, rippling the water.</p> <p>Seeing that, Lin Qiao began wondering if Xie Dong had been drained and thrown out like that as well. She remembered that when Xie Dong floated up, the water surface had rippled intensively.</p> <p>As the female zombie floated up like a dead body, Lin Qiao carefully prepared to swim over to it.</p> <p>But right at that moment, the vines suddenly wriggled toward Lin Qiao. By the time she gave a start, the vines had coiled around her ankles, then quickly reached upward.</p> <p>‘Damn! They’re not gonna drain me as well, are they?’ She screamed silently.</p>",
  "Chapter 96: The Second Round of Recovery": "<p>Lin Qiao had just witnessed those vines turn a zombie into a dead body, so when she saw them suddenly wrap herself, she subconsciously felt that they would drain her own energy as well, and was taken aback.</p> <p>However, by the time she could react and try to dodge, it was already too late.</p> <p>Like the last time, she sensed a gentle power slowly coiling around her body, and her mind settled suddenly. At this moment, she couldn’t feel the vines absorbing her energy. Instead, she sensed a familiar itch and numbness from her legs. It seemed that the vines were preparing to heal her body again like they did the last time.</p> <p>As she expected, when the vines covered her entire body, only leaving her face unwrapped, her mind became unclear. But soon, she woke back up to feel the numbness and itch from the skin and muscles of her arms and legs, as well as the soreness and swelling of her body.</p> <p>Right after that, her head slowly began to ache. First, it was waves of dull headache, followed by a head-exploding pain, which was growing stronger and stronger.</p> <p>This time, Lin Qiao didn’t open her mouth and screech in her head, but clenched her teeth and closed her eyes to endure the pain silently. She knew that she wouldn’t pass out, but had to sense that pain clear-mindedly and accept it.</p> <p>Compared to the last time, she now had a different mindset. The last time, she was in panic and didn’t know what to do, so the pain was especially unbearable to her. But this time, she knew that what was happening was beneficial to her, so she endured that pain with happiness. In this way, that pain had become more bearable for her.</p> <p>Thinking that her broken body would be slowly restored, she didn’t care about the pain at all.</p> <p>Time kept on passing while she was suffering the pain. Lin Qiao felt every second being too long, and that her head was going to explode at any moment. However, she didn’t pass out, even though she wanted to. For some reason, her mind was extra clear during this process.</p> <p>Half an hour later, the pain in Lin Qiao’s head suddenly began to fade; however, she felt that she had suffered for half a century. The vines didn’t unwrap her suddenly and disappear like they did the last time, but gradually loosened. Lin Qiao let out a long sigh of relief.</p> <p>It was finally over!</p> <p>The vines soon disappeared. At that moment, Lin Qiao had no idea that a bright green light was moving in her purely black eyes. The green light circled in her eyes, then turned into a pair of faintly green, glowing pupils.</p> <p>However, the pair of green pupils soon disappeared from her purely black eyes.</p> <p>Finally, she could finally move again. She lowered her head to look at her body and found that her clothes were all gone, as expected.</p> <p>Under the green light of the lake water, she saw that the wounds on her thighs were really healed up! The muscles in the wounds had all regrown, but the skin continued to be in different colors. However, it already looked much better than before.</p> <p>She then looked at the hole in her stomach, and found something strange.</p> <p>She couldn’t see her intestines anymore. Before, some broken internal organs were left in her stomach; but now, nothing was in there, as it was emptied!</p> <p>Not a thing was left in her damaged stomach! Lin Qiao was dumbfounded as she stared at her own stomach in shock.  <em>‘What is this? What happened? God knows what happened! Damn! Don’t I need to eat anymore? Eh? But I still feel hungry!’</em></p> <p>She touched her stomach with her hands, but felt nothing strange save for a smooth surface. Her stomach was now empty and clean, without even a small piece of her old internal organs left in it!</p> <p>She silently glanced at the green light in the lake. She really wanted to ask the lake a question, <em>‘What did you do to me!’</em></p> <p>However, she stopped worrying when she saw her healed thighs. She glanced at her stomach for the last time, then decided to leave it be, as it wouldn’t affect her life anyway. Well, she believed so at least.</p> <p>She then checked her arms and found that her arms were healed as well. Now, she had a pair of unwounded arms. Suddenly, she thought of her face and raised her hands to touch it. But in the next moment, she felt that her face was still full of hollows and bumps.</p> <p>Without a question, her face hadn’t been healed yet.</p> <p>It seemed that the energy was only enough to heal her limbs this time, as her body and face were all left unhealed.</p> <p>She put down her hands disappointedly. But in fact, she wasn’t really upset. On the contrary, she was quite happy, because at least her arms and thighs were healed. Besides, she had learned how to trigger the energy down in the lake bottom already. To do that, she only needed to find another high-level zombie.</p> <p>Thinking about that, she began swimming ashore. She had already gotten what she wanted, so it would be meaningless for her to stay in the water.</p> <p>When the reached the water surface, she saw an object floating on it. Without a doubt, that was the poor female zombie which had been drained by the lake just now.</p> <p>Lin Qiao swam to the zombie’s body nakedly, then dragged it to the lakeside.</p> <p>Junjun and the little boy weren’t around the lake. It seemed that they were in the small space, and hadn’t discovered what just happened in the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slowly walked out of the water and threw the zombie body aside, then walked to Wu Yueling’s bed, which now had some clothes piled on it. She picked a training suit which was ripped off from a robber, then put it on herself.</p> <p>She didn’t go to Junjun after putting the clothes on, but went back to the lakeside, dragged the female zombie’s collar, and brought it out of the space.</p> <p>She returned to the top of the building and threw the female zombie to the ground, then squatted and cut open its head.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>She cut off its skull, exposing the sticky grey matter inside the zombie’s head. To be honest, it didn’t even look like brain matter anymore.</p> <p>Lin Qiao reached out her claws, prepared to look for the female zombie’s nucleus. However, she paused suddenly and turned to look around. She found a twig which was sent up by the tornado, so she picked it up immediately. After that, she stirred the grey brain matter with the twig, then found a thumb-sized, white zombie nucleus.</p> <p>The color of the nucleus had faded. It seemed that without the energy, the nucleus had turned back into the white color of ordinary zombies’ nuclei.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked the zombie nucleus up, then sensed a warmth from her fingertips. However, the warmth faded before it could make a circle in her body.</p> <p>In the next second, the zombie nucleus in her hand turned into white powder and fell off. It seemed to be the leftovers of the vines down in the lake bottom.</p> <p>Lin Qiao patted away the powder from her hand and then stood up.</p>",
  "Chapter 97: Grow Further Stronger": "<p>At that moment, a white figure showed up by Lin Qiao’s side.</p> <p>Qiu Lili came up to the roof and stood on a stone mound beside Lin Qiao. She looked at the latter from head to toe with confusion, as if she was confirming something.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little surprised when seeing the look in Qiu Lili’s face. It seemed that Qiu Lili had sensed the change of her body.</p> <p>“Aw?”<br/>\n‘What happened?’ Qiu Lili looked at the dead body of the female zombie which was lying on the ground, then asked curiously.</p> <p>She sensed that Lin Qiao’s vibe had changed largely in a strange way. It didn’t just grow much stronger than before, but was added with something weird, which even gave her a sense of danger. Even though that sense of danger wasn’t strong yet, she felt that if that vibe grew further stronger, Lin Qiao would become hard to deal with, even for herself.</p> <p>Even as a level-six powerful zombie, Qiu Lili felt that Lin Qiao was somehow dangerous. However, Lin Qiao didn’t know that she could make other zombies feel that way yet.</p> <p>Perhaps, Qiu Lili was able to detect the special vibe of Lin Qiao because she was a zombie queen. The zombies below level-six wouldn’t probably be able to sense it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao clasped her own hands, feeling that an energy was concentrated in her palms. She spread her fingers and popped her claws. Her black, metal-lustered claws had now turned light-silver.</p> <p>When seeing Lin Qiao’s claws, Qiu Lili sensed a coldness from her heart. Meanwhile, that sense of danger she had grew stronger.</p> <p>“Aw-Goro!”<br/>\n‘I feel that your claws are so dangerous!’ Qiu Lili uttered a strange voice from her throat to tell Lin Qiao that.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and communicated with her through her eyes that she herself felt the same way. She then turned to swing her claws at the halfway-broken wall behind her. A few beams of sharp light flashed across the air, toward that wall.</p> <p>After a series of slight noises, the sounds of stones falling onto the ground could be heard.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili both felt speechless when watching the wall two meters away being cut into pieces by a random move of the former. Lin Qiao now felt that the pain she suffered in the lake was nothing!</p> <p>Before, the air blades created by her claws could only reach about ten centimeters away. But now, they were actually able to hurt things two meters away! That meant, the effective range of her attack had expanded to two meters! She was able to cut off her enemies’ heads from two meters away now!</p> <p>Besides, that strong and sharp air blade could even cut ordinary zombies into pieces.</p> <p>She raised her head to sniff around, realizing that she was now able to sense the scents from a very long distance away, meaning that range of her senses had expanded largely as well.</p> <p>She felt that all her abilities had improved a lot, but still didn’t know which level she was at.</p> <p>Was she a level-four space-powered zombie?</p> <p>She took out the notepad and wrote— <em>‘What level do you think I’m currently at?’</em></p> <p>Qiu Lili looked at her with confusion. She didn’t understand the meaning of Lin Qiao’s question, and couldn’t sense her zombie level and energy grade.</p> <p>She shook her head, told Lin Qiao that she couldn’t sense it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao remained silent for a few seconds, then turned to go downstairs. She made a leap and covered an entire staircase, feeling that it was quite an easy thing to do. While doing that, she sensed no danger at all, as if she was jumping off merely one stair step. On landing, her feet fell back to the ground lightly and stably, and her toes felt no counterforce from the ground.</p> <p>No wonder the other high-level zombies all leaped as high and far as monkeys.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had tried that before, but when she jumped down the entire staircase, her feet went numb. She suffered no pain, but wasn’t able to control her feet for a while.</p> <p>Therefore, she was jealous of the other high-level zombies sometimes. She seemed to be at the same level as they were, but for some reason, she wasn’t able to leap around as nimbly as them. But this time, she sensed nothing after jumping off the stairs. Her feet weren’t numbed, and she could still control them.</p> <p>She also felt that she could actually jump down from higher places, that her legs were enabling her to cover a much longer distance safely than the staircase, with one leap.</p> <p>She leaped down the stairs like a rabbit, and had also become much faster than before. So, within ten seconds, she came down to the third floor from the roof. After that, she directly leaped down from the hole on the wall which was caused by the female zombie’s tornado.</p> <p>She didn’t even need to make a roll when landing, but stood straight on the ground.</p> <p>When jumping down and landing, she couldn’t even sense her own weight. She even felt that she had fallen from the air rather slowly, airily landing on the ground like a leaf…</p> <p>Was she really that light? She was at least forty kilograms, but how could she possibly drift down from the third floor like a leaf? She pictured that scene in her mind and found it quite weird.</p> <p>In another way, Lin Qiao felt that her reactions had become faster, and the strength of her legs had grown greater. Therefore, her body became nimbler.</p> <p>More precisely, she was like a cat.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao landed on the ground, she saw Qiu Lili standing on a pillar beside her. It seemed that the latter had been waiting for her since long ago.</p> <p>She knew that Qiu Lili had wind power, but had no idea how the latter upgraded herself to such a high level. She was rather curious about that, but now wasn’t the time for her to ask the question.</p> <p>She touched her own face. Now, she needed to find more high-level zombies, because she wanted to fix her face and make herself look like a normal human being again.</p> <p>Then, the rubbed her dry and disheveled hair, thinking that maybe she should have a haircut.</p> <p>However, she then touched her own chest. Her breasts were almost flat, and she was wearing menswear. Added with the fact that Lu Tianyu was five feet and eight inches tall, she would look just like a man if she cut her hair…</p> <p>She sighed silently, thinking of her tangled hair and her ghost-like face as she felt that looking like a man was better than that. Most importantly, she wouldn’t be needing to wash her long hair every single day after cutting them.</p> <p>She wanted to cut her hair since long ago, so now, she finally made the decision. She didn’t need to cover her face anyway, because even if she covered it, it could still scare the children!</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then recalled that she had seen a pair of scissors when packing Qiu Lili’s stuff! She didn’t know what Qiu Lili needed scissors for, but she wanted to borrow it now.</p> <p>She took out the notepad and wrote— <em>‘I want to borrow your scissors.’</em></p> <p>After that, she turned and entered her space, leaving Qiu Lili in confusion.</p> <p><em>‘What does she want to borrow the scissors for? And, aren’t my things all in her space?’ </em>Qiu Lili looked around bewilderedly while thinking, as she had no choice but to wait for the other to come out.</p>",
  "Chapter 98: Her Current Look": "<p>After entering her space, Lin Qiao directly showed up beside the pile of furniture which belonged to Qiu Lili. The clearing next to the former’s old furniture area was now occupied by things from where Qiu Lili lived before. She hadn’t sorted them out yet, so these things were just piled here randomly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rummaged a little and found a dressing table. She pulled open the drawer of the dressing table and took out the scissors.</p> <p>On the other side, Jujun had also heard the noise she made. In fact, she had sensed Lin Qiao earlier when the latter came out of the lake, but didn’t come out to see what happened. However, she did come out this time, and the little boy wasn’t following her.</p> <p>Once she came out of the small space, she saw Lin Qiao cutting her now entangled hair with a scissor.</p> <p>‘You should have done that long ago! Your hair are even uglier than that of a ghost. They still looked awful even when you tied them up.’ Junjun thought.</p> <p>Soon, Lin Qiao bobbed her hair and sensed a coolness from her stomach. Her head seemed to be a lot lighter than before, and she felt quite good. However, just before she put down the scissors, she turned to find that Junjun was looking at her with a weird expression from a short distance.</p> <p>Her asymmetric and messy hairstyle was so awful!</p> <p>At last, Junjun couldn’t bear looking at Lin Qiao’s hair anymore. She walked over, pointed at the scissors in Lin Qiao’s hand, then at her head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood her meaning. Junjun must have felt that her new hairstyle was too ugly, and wanted to help in cutting her hair.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t have a mirror, so she had no idea how her hair looked at the moment. However, judging by the look in Junjun’s face, she knew that it might be quite bad.</p> <p>So, Junjun took over the scissors, then signaled for Lin Qiao to squat.</p> <p>Lin Qiao complied, then felt the other pulling and cutting her hair. A couple of minutes later, Junjun put down the scissors and patted her on the shoulder.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up and touched her own head, finding that her hair was much shorter and neater than before.</p> <p>At that moment, Junjun found a mirror from Qiu Lili’s belongings, then put it up to Lin Qiao’s face.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was amazed by her short hair and scarred face in the mirror. So, she automatically took over the mirror and prepared to take a closer look at herself.</p> <p>Before this, she hadn’t had the chance to look at herself in the mirror. She had learned that Lu Tianyu had a pretty face from the latter’s memories, but had never looked at that face with her own eyes. All she had was the memories in her head.</p> <p>At this moment, she saw an oval face in the mirror. The face was rather small, so it was completely damaged by the few large scars on it. She saw that her eyes were black, nose was straight, and that her lips looked normal, without being cracked like that of other zombies.</p> <p>She imagined herself with a cracked face and felt that that would be even scarier than the scars on her face.</p> <p>She then looked closer and found that her mouth was actually pretty. Her mouth wasn’t small or full, but had a beautiful shape. The upper lip was slightly thinner than the lower lip. Lin Qiao felt that her mouth was nice-looking, even though it wasn’t really hers.</p> <p>Her straight-nose was rather eye-catching, as it was the first thing she noticed on her face. Her eyes were purely black, such that she couldn’t find her own pupils. Those eyes were pretty as well, slightly rising at the ends, with long and curly eyelashes.</p> <p>Without those scars, her eyes, nose, and mouth would look stunning on her perfectly shaped face.</p> <p>However, no one else in the base had seen that face of Lu Tianyu without makeup. Of course, people could scarcely see that before the apocalypse either because she had started learning how to make up since she was sixteen. After that, she began wearing makeup every day. Not even Lu Tianyi had seen her without makeup since then, because once she removed it, she would stay in her room without coming out.</p> <p>Therefore, everyone who was now familiar with her only remembered her face covered with thick makeup. In the post-apocalyptic world, people cared about nothing more than filling their stomachs and living in nice places without being eaten by zombies. Most of the human survivors had forgotten about those cosmetics which were worthless after the apocalypse but expensive before that, but Lu Tianyu had collected tons of them!</p> <p>She traded the food given by Yang Chao for her cosmetics. Because of that, Yang Chao wanted to kill her many times. Once, she actually traded a bagful of polished rice for a lipstick! Back then, Yang Chao didn’t kill her because he still wanted her for her beautiful body and face.</p> <p>When these memories emerged in Lin Qiao’s mind, she felt that Lu Tianxu had truly lived an extravagant life. No wonder Yang Chao got tired of her so soon, and even killed her.</p> <p>Seeing that her messy hair had become short and neat, Lin Qiao suddenly felt her mood turning better.</p> <p>She didn’t expect her hair-cutting to be so successful. Her hair couldn’t cover the scars on her face anymore, but before long, those scars would all be healed. After learning that the energy in the lake was able to fix her body, Lin Qiao had stopped worrying about her face.</p> <p>She now knew that she could trigger the energy in the lake with the energy contained in the nuclei of other zombies. That didn’t even require much of efforts, as all she needed to do was to simply throw her targets into the lake. Now, she was able to turn herself invisible, so she had no fear!</p> <p>Her invisibility was the best tool to launch sneak attacks, and just couldn’t be more useful!</p> <p>She glanced at the center of the lake, then turned back to the mirror to look at her dark and cold eyes. She felt that she needed to find a pair of sunglasses to cover those eyes, so she wondered if Qiu Lili happened to have collected some.</p> <p>With that thought, she put the mirror into Junjun’s hands, then began rummaging.</p> <p>While Lin Qiao was looking for a pair of sunglasses, Qiu Lili was standing on a rock, idly waiting for her to show up. Suddenly, her eyes moved, and then she turned her face to the road in the direction they had traveled from.</p> <p>Maybe because all creatures in this area had been cleaned away by that dead level-four zombie, it was all quiet now, and a slight noise immediately caught Qiu Lili’s attention. But of course, she would still be able to sense it even if this area was noisy.</p> <p>Miles away, a commonly-seen modified car was driving toward her.</p> <p>Eight people were sitting in the car, while a strange woman was calmly sitting on the top. It was a zombie-hunting squad with nine members.</p> <p>The woman sitting on top of the car was average-looking. Her hair were tied in a high ponytail, reaching her thighs. Her legs were crossed, back straight. She was sitting very stably on top of the car, such that no matter how quickly the car turned or how intensely it bumped, she was always motionless.</p> <p>She was facing the rear of the car, looking a little slender. She was wearing a slim-fit sports suit, which had emphasized her thin and straight waist.</p> <p>Her face was average-looking, but flawless. In the post-apocalyptic world where women were scarce, a woman with such a clean face would be considered quite adorable.</p> <p>…Only if the look on her face was just a little warmer.</p>",
  "Chapter 99: The Human Beings Who Showed Up": "<p>The woman looked cold and expressionless. Her eyes were fixed straight on the rear of the car, without showing any emotions. She didn’t even seem to be alert or careful; she had been making completely no response to the changes in the surrounding environment.</p> <p>This cold-faced woman had been giving out a strong vibe, and a sharp katana was placed on her knees.</p> <p>In contrast, the people sitting in the car were all men.</p> <p>It didn’t seem right for a group of men to let a woman sit on the car roof alone. However, no one in the car was able to defeat that woman. So, they stayed silent and let her sit on top of the car as she wanted.</p> <p>“The tornado created by that wind-powered zombie was highly destructive. And, it’s reaching level-five. Are we really gonna get it this time? So many people died the last time, but we still failed,” someone in the car said.</p> <p>“What are you afraid of? Didn’t we find a level-five metal-powered fighter this time? And, there are so many of us. How can we possibly fail to kill a level-four superpowered zombie? I’m afraid that other people would get it before us if we don’t do it as soon as possible.”</p> <p>“You’re right! The secret has leaked out. The others have found out that a level-four superpowered zombie is in this area. If we don’t move faster, it won’t be our fight anymore.”</p> <p>“It’s because of that b*stard. For a bag of bread, he actually told some other people about what happened the last time. If he was not following Deputy Chief every day, I’d have tortured him to death.”</p> <p>“Be patient, you’ll get a chance! But, the first priority now is to get the zombie nucleus. A level-four zombie nucleus and a dozen level-three ones can get us a good deal of food and weapon, which will last a month.”</p> <p>“And quilts! Damn, it’s been freezing at night lately! I can’t even have a warm bed to sleep in at home.”</p> <p>“Yeah, Chief Netherworld Fire had burned a big half of the base. Who dares to get near that area now? And that son of a b*tch named Yang Jianhua, he actually stabbed our Chief in the back. Such a scum!”</p> <p>“Exactly! If our Chief didn’t take us all into the base and give us protection, how could we have possibly survived till now? I really didn’t think that Yang Jianhua would be bought by other bases and would betray us! Because of him, we can’t even live a peaceful life in the base anymore.”</p> <p>“I heard that Yang Jianghua is hunting the Captain and his people. He wants to get Cheng Wangxue and Lin Wenwen back to be his women.”</p> <p>“I hope Captain and his families won’t fall in his hands soon. Yang Jianhua is a level-six powerful man. Captain might have had a chance against him, but I heard that Yang Jianhua is with another level-six superpowered man, who has come from the Earth Dragon Base to help him.”</p> <p>The men in the car were talking about the things that happened in their base resentfully. However, they didn’t know that when they mentioned Lin Wenwen, the woman on the car roof showed something in her eyes.</p> <p>That was a look of concern.</p> <p>Before long, the car was driving into the wind-powered female zombie’s territory. A group of zombies followed behind the car, reaching their hands out while shambling toward it. However, these zombies weren’t as fast as the car. Only a few at level one or two ran slightly faster than the others, but still didn’t have a chance to get near the car.</p> <p>Everyone in the car had a loaded gun gripped in their hands. They put the guns out of the window to prepare for an emergency. Therefore, each time a zombie tried to approach, their bullets would sink into its head.</p> <p>They looked out of the car windows in full vigilance while the car slowly moved toward Qiu Lili, getting closer and closer to her.</p> <p>Qiu Lili’s eyes sparkled, showing a trace of fear. Then, she disappeared from where she was, quietly hiding in a nearby building. She stood by a window on the top floor, looking down at the ground.</p> <p>What she had experienced before made her instinctively want to hide on seeing human beings approach. She was powerful now, but still wasn’t willing to hurt human beings. Even though human beings had hurt her before, she never thought about taking revenge.</p> <p>While driving further into the wind-powered female zombi’s territory, the people in the car suddenly found something unusual.</p> <p>“Eh? Why are those ordinary zombies able to get in? Earlier on, they didn’t dare to come near this area. But this time, they didn’t even stop, just chasing us in. Why’s that?” Du Yuanxing, who sat in the front seat, said with confusion as he saw the large group of ordinary zombies behind the car from the rearview mirror.</p> <p>The others in the car turned back and found that the group of zombie really showed no sign of stopping, but continued following behind their car.</p> <p>Some of them had been here before, while the rest were here to help. The few who were here for the first time didn’t yet know well about the situation of this area.</p> <p>In crowded places like city centers, the number of zombies was naturally proportional to the number of people before the old world ended. However, when Du Yuanxing and his teammates came here for the first time, they found not even one zombie. Therefore, they figured out that they had entered the territory of a high-level zombie.</p> <p>Last time, they came with twelve people. After being attacked by the level-four zombie with a tornado, the weak and ordinary ones died right on the spot. At last, only four or five superpowered ones managed to escape, including Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>A level-five superpowered human being was a level higher than a level-four zombie. However, the zombie they were looking for was at the top of the level-four, and was just a breath away from level-five. Therefore, Du Yuanxing’s team, which had only one level-five superpowered zombie hunter, at that time, was no match for the level-four wind-powered zombie.</p> <p>This time, they found another level-five superpowered fighter to join their team, paying a high price for that service.</p> <p>Currently, level-five superpowered people were considered very strong in the bases of human survivors, and mostly possessed high status. Normally, they had their own squads or official positions. But still, some of them preferred to stay alone and independent, such as the one on the car roof.</p> <p>The woman on the car roof was named Long Qingying. She was a woman, but was famous in the Hades Base for her strength. She was indifferent, never liking to be with others. She was always alone, and hardly ever teamed up with other people when she came out of the base.</p> <p>She had no family. The only person who was close with her was Lin Wenwen, the younger sister of Chief Netherworld Fire.</p> <p>It was said that Long Qingying had given Lin Wenwen and her family a great help, so they could escape successfully. For this reason, a lot of people from the base now wanted to bring her troubles. That was why she came out to hunt zombies; out here, she could at least hide for a while.</p> <p>Besides, being out here was not bad for Long Qingying. If the people from her base weren’t going to leave her alone, she would consider moving to the Sea City Base.</p> <p>At the moment, she was planning on collecting as much food as possible, to prepare for what was going to happen next.</p>",
  "Chapter 100: The Disgusting Zombie": "<p>Cai Hongqing, who was driving the car, glanced at the rearview mirror and found that the zombies behind them really didn’t seem to stop. So, he too said in surprise, “What’s going on? Isn’t this the level-four zombie’s territory? Or, are those zombies under its control?”</p> <p>“Control? Level-four zombies aren’t able to control other zombies, are they? They’re not like level-five zombie leaders!” Sitting in the backseat, Chen Li responded confusedly.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing stuck his head out of the car window to observe the situation behind.</p> <p>They were driving fast, and had picked the roads with fewer zombies. But once they got near this area, more and more zombies began showing up.</p> <p>A large number of zombies were coming from all directions, rushing toward their car fearlessly. It seemed that this area was no longer under a high-level zombie’s control, and the lower-level zombies were now free to come and leave.</p> <p>The last time when they were here, this place was all quiet. But now, things were completely different.</p> <p>“It’s not good! There are more and more zombies coming here, and their number is rising fast!” After a short while of observing, Du Yuanxing said frowningly.</p> <p>At that moment, Long Qingying stood up on the car roof while carrying her katana. She stood on top of the car with her legs apart; the look in her face turned alert from bland.</p> <p>She carried the katana with her left hand which was behind her back, while raising her right hand toward the zombie crowd behind the car, fingers spread and palm facing forward.</p> <p>Every time some zombies were less than ten meters away from the car, she would slightly bend her fingers. Following her move, the surrounding metal objects, such as door frames, nails, and steel tubes would fly toward her from all directions.</p> <p>These metal objects would gather together in front of her, then melt into a metal ball. The metal ball would boil in the air like molten metal in a melting pot. Before long, the molten metal would solidify and become countless sharp steel thorns, then fly at the zombies behind the car one after each other.</p> <p>Puff! Put! Puff!</p> <p>A series of noises were heard when the metal thorns went through the zombies’ bodies.</p> <p>That was the reason why the others didn’t dare to offend Long Qingying. No one wanted hundreds of metal thorns piercing into their bodies!</p> <p>Watching the metal thorns penetrate the heads of the zombies which were in the front of the crowd, the men in the car silently raised their heads to glance at the car roof. After that, they continued shooting the zombies in their heads which attempted to approach.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>“Roar! Roar…” Because of the gunshots, more and more zombies started to gather from all directions. Soon, the road before the car was completely blocked.</p> <p>“There are zombies at the front too. The car can’t pass through.”</p> <p>This car was able to knock away seven or eight zombies; but facing over ten zombies, it wouldn’t have a chance.</p> <p>“What happened? Why are there more and more zombies appearing here? Where’s the high-level one?”</p> <p>Seeing that more and more zombies were showing up, the people in the car all sensed that something was not right.</p> <p>What was happening? Why was this area suddenly crowded with zombies? Since they entered this area a few minutes ago, about three-hundred zombies had shown up, and more had been gushing out from the surrounding buildings and alleys. A level-four zombie couldn’t possibly control so many ordinary zombies.</p> <p>This block was surrounded by streets and shops and alleys. Had all these zombies been hiding in those places before they arrived?</p> <p>Did they come out after they drove into this area?</p> <p>At that moment, no one in the car had noticed that about three-hundred meters away from the zombie crowd, a figure was standing before a French window in a four-story building while looking at them.</p> <p>The window glass was broken long ago. That figure was standing right there, such that as long as Du Yuanxing and his teammates raised their heads to glance in that direction, they would see it.</p> <p>The figure wasn’t tall, only about four feet in height. It was fat, with a huge head. That head was as large as the combination of two human heads, looking very weird. In fact, it was combined with two heads indeed. Not only its head, but its body was also combined with two bodies, and that was why it looked fat.</p> <p>Its face was indescribably unpleasant to look at. Even the word ‘ugly’ wasn’t enough to describe it; probably ‘disgusting’ would do! One could imagine it as two smashed human faces being put together; four eyes, two noses, two cracked mouths which had been put together!</p> <p>Its entire head was weirdly out of shape, large and unsightly. The skin on its head had gone, leaving only a bloody flesh and wet hair sticking to it.</p> <p>On the other side, Qiu Lili quietly leaped down from the top of her building and came to this area after sensing that zombie. She wanted to see that level-four zombie which had shown up suddenly. As a result, she was stunned by the way it looked on seeing the zombie from the roof of another building.</p> <p>‘What the hell is that! That is way too… gross!’ She thought.</p> <p>Qiu Lili took only one glance at it, then silently turned her eyes away without daring to look at it again.</p> <p>As she had restrained her vibe entirely, this level-four zombie didn’t discover her. But to her surprise, she hadn’t sensed this zombie either before when it arrived. So, she didn’t know if it just came from another place, or had been hiding here the whole time.</p> <p>Besides, she clearly sensed that all the ordinary zombies who had suddenly shown up in this area were summoned by the gross level-four zombie. Not only the ones before her eyes, but more ordinary zombies were gathering toward this area from a hundred meters away, hundreds of meters away, and even miles away.</p> <p>Soon, this place would be filled up by ordinary zombies and become a city of zombies.</p> <p>Qiu Lili sensed that the gross zombie had a very strong desire toward the people in the car. Its bloodthirsty vibe suffused the air, making her wanted to throw up.</p> <p>How could such a zombie even exist?</p> <p>Qiu Lili didn’t understand why the gross zombie was able to control so many ordinary zombies and make them all rush toward the car.</p> <p>Normally, the zombies at level-five or below couldn’t possibly control so many ordinary zombies. Even a level-five zombie could only control a limited number of ordinary zombies.</p> <p>Ordinary zombies didn’t have intelligence, but only instincts. Controlling them was like controlling puppets. To do that, one only needed to occupy their minds with its own.</p> <p>However, the zombies at level-five or below weren’t able to spare such a strong willpower to control the minds of so many ordinary zombies. At most, they could spread their own vibes to make the surrounding ordinary zombies feel suppressed and move away.</p> <p>On the other side, Du Yuanxing and his teammates had stopped their car already, as the zombies around them had gathered into a zombie wall and were charging at them.</p>",
  "Chapter 101: Stalemate": "<p>Du Yuanxing looked at the zombie crowd in front of him, somehow feeling that his team had fallen into a trap. “Zu, open a path!” He shouted at another man.</p> <p>“Sure! Watch this!” A man in the backseat responded immediately. He moved to the car window and stuck his head and an arm out. Then, he raised his arm to his shoulder level, toward the zombies before the car.</p> <p>After that, the ground before the car started cracking, showed some rifts which were about one or two meters deep. Meanwhile, earth thorns and blocks began rising from under the zombies’ feet, instantly tearing the zombie group apart and throwing them to the ground. In the next instant, the rifts were closed, and countless zombies which had fallen down were buried.</p> <p>Seeing the zombie wall having fallen apart, Cai Hongqing immediately trampled the accelerator and made the car rush forward. Many zombies which were standing on the road, or hadn’t managed to struggle up from the ground, were sent flying away by the car.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the zombies they killed weren’t more than the ones that soon showed up. In two minutes, their car was surrounded again.</p> <p>Long Qingying knitted her brows, abruptly putting her katana into the leather sheath tied around her waist. Then, she raised her arms to the shoulder level, toward the zombies before and behind the car.</p> <p>Soon, the steel thorns she released flew out of the heads of the dead zombies, then gathered around her body again.</p> <p>She boosted her power, causing more metal objects to fly toward her, as if she had a giant magnetic field in her body that trapped all the surrounding metal objects.</p> <p>The metal objects formed a circle two-meters in radius around Long Qingying, then melted and reformed into countless new steel thorns that darted toward the zombie crowd.</p> <p>The attacks she launched were all with a large range. She was able to kill tens of ordinary zombies with one strike, then quickly reclaim the metal thorns and attack again. Therefore, the dead bodies of zombies soon piled up around her.</p> <p>Seeing Long Qingying easily stopping the zombie crowd which were charging fiercely at the car, the people in the car all sighed in relief.</p> <p>At that moment, she stomped her foot against the car roof and said with a cold voice, “This place is controlled either by a level-five zombie leader, or a level-four zombie with spiritual power.”</p> <p>Hearing her words, the people in the car had their hearts sinking.</p> <p>Indeed, normal superpowered zombies wouldn’t possibly be able to control such a giant zombie group. They had killed one or two hundred ordinary zombies, but were still facing six or seven hundred of them. To make matters worse, more of them had been joining the crowd and charging at them.</p> <p>“That seems to be true! If she’s right, added with that wind-powered zombie, we might be in trouble this time!” Du Yuanxing scanned every corner in the surrounding with his eyes to try and spot that high-level zombie which had been controlling the zombie crowd,</p> <p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>With the roars of the zombies, the noises caused when Long Qingying’s steel thorns pierced into zombie heads, and the gunshots fired by the people in the car, this area had turned a little chaotic.</p> <p>“Find the zombie which is controlling the crowd first!” Long Qingying shouted to the people in the car.</p> <p>“We’re trying! But, it’s obviously hiding!” Du Yuanxing and his teammates had all been searching carefully for that zombie, but failed to find any zombie which was different from the ordinary ones.</p> <p>At that point, the battle had slowly been locked in a stalemate. The zombie was using a huge-crowd strategy. Long Qingying and her teammates weren’t falling at a disadvantage so soon, but were showing no sign of winning either, as they were busy dealing with the ordinary zombies. It was a little difficult for them to break out of the encirclement of zombies indeed.</p> <p>On the other side, Qiu Lili had been watching all this with cold eyes. She didn’t want to kill these human beings, but had no intention of saving them either. She used to be hunted by human beings. She considered herself as extra nice for not taking revenge against human beings, but would never save any of them.</p> <p>Therefore, she didn’t take part in this battle. As for the nucleus of that disgusting zombie, she wasn’t interested in it at all.</p> <p>She quietly stood on the tall building beside the battlefield, sensing more and more zombies coming this way. It was going to be a surging tide of zombies.</p> <p>The few human beings needed to evacuate now, because they wouldn’t be able to kill every zombie in this area, not even if they consumed their powers up.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and his teammates couldn’t see what Qiu Lili had seen. All they could see at that moment was a giant group of zombies surrounding them. Those were more than a thousand zombies right there.</p> <p>The zombies crowded around them, such that they could only see their heads. This place was like the train station before the Spring Festival in the old world, terrifyingly crowded.</p> <p>However, as they had already come all the way here, they surely didn’t want return with empty hands. So, they needed to find the two high-level zombies and kill them as soon as possible, then leave with their nuclei.</p> <p>Long Qingying was holding off the zombie crowd at the moment, but there were too many zombies. “I can’t hold them for long.”</p> <p>She didn’t tell the people in the car what to do, only informing them about her current situation so that they could prepare for what was going to happen next.</p> <p>It was the first time for Long Qingying to work with other people. If Du Yuanxing and his teammates hadn’t provided her with a good deal of food before the journey began, she wouldn’t have agreed to help them.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and his teammates knew that she needed a large amount of food to leave the base, so they sneakily found her and asked her help.</p> <p>Looking at the expanding zombie crowd, Du Yuanxing nodded knowingly and said, “Please hold on for a little while. We’ll be able to find that zombie soon. If you’re tired, you can take a rest and we’ll do the job.”</p> <p>“Okay,” Long Qingying responded.</p> <p>At that point, the big-headed zombie got a little anxious, as it had been so long but the giant zombie crowd still hadn’t managed to throw the few human beings into a panic. It suddenly opened its badly cracked mouth and uttered a weird sound.</p> <p>Squeak…!</p> <p>The voice wasn’t loud, but it spread far and wide.</p> <p>Qiu Lili was standing in the building which wasn’t far away from the big-headed zombie. Hearing its voice, she immediately sensed a sharp pain from her brain, and then started feeling sick.</p> <p>She frowned, and her vibe was shaken, but didn’t spread.</p> <p>“Aw?” Nevertheless, the big-headed zombie immediately sensed the strong vibe of Qiu Lili, who was a level-six zombie. But, that vibe was gone before it could grasp it. It looked around in confusion, yet failed to detect that vibe.</p> <p>On the other side, Long Qingying and her teammates suffered much worse than Qiu Lili did. They weren’t just feeling sick, but had a piercing pain in their heads that made them tremble. Their whole bodies were nearly softened at this point.</p>",
  "Chapter 102: Spirit-Powered Zombie": "<p>“Em!” Long Qingying moaned with a muffled voice as she kneeled on the car roof on one knee with softened legs. She supported her body with both arms, dropping her head with a twisted face and a pained look.</p> <p>In the car, except for Du Yuanxing, who was also a level-five superpowered one, the others had all begun howling in pain.</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>“Ouch! My head!”</p> <p>“Eh… What… is… going… on? My head!”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing pressed his head with both hands. His whole body was twitching, but still, he took a deep breath and managed to reach out a hand toward the zombies who grasped the opportunity to pounce on the car.</p> <p>A thick bolt of lightning was released from his palm, splitting into an electric web and descending on those zombies.</p> <p>After a series of sizzling noise and an exploding sound, a dozen zombies were directly burned into smoky coke pieces by Du Yuanxing’s electric web.</p> <p>He was a rare electric-powered man. If he weren’t at a relatively high level, his electricity power wouldn’t be so harmful to the zombies, but would be effective on human beings indeed.</p> <p>Because of his power, he was one of the top-ranked people in his base whom no one dared to offend. Who would want to be struck by electricity? Even imagining that could scare people.</p> <p>The others in the car were all paralyzed at the moment. They buried their heads in their hands, teeth bared while moaning in pain. The looks on their faces revealed their misery.</p> <p>“Damn… This is… a spiritual attack… right?” Cai Hongqing was holding the steering wheel with both hands, head pressing on it. He even wanted to hit his head against the steering wheel to ease his pain.</p> <p>“Em… It hurts so much… Shun, how’re you doing? Shun? Shun!” The people in the backseat suddenly found that the weakest man in the team, who was just an ordinary man, had already shown the whites of his eyes and was foaming at the mouth.</p> <p>Long Qingying, who was still on the car roof, had recovered now. She raised her head to find that the surrounding zombie crowd had already reached the car. As the people in the car were all disabled, no one was trying to stop the zombies from approaching, and soon, the ring of encirclement shrank.</p> <p>She stood up, then raised a hand to gather the surrounding metal objects again and launch another wave of steel thorns to kill the zombies which had almost laid their hands on the car.</p> <p>“Drive! There are too many zombie bodies. If we don’t move now, we’ll be buried here!” While attacking, she shouted at the people in the car.</p> <p>At that moment, Du Yuanxing had recovered as well. “Move! Stop looking for that level-four zombie. Retreat now!” He told Cai Hongqing to move the car as soon as possible.</p> <p>They hadn’t found their target, but under the current situation, they had no choice but to retreat for now. They needed to figure out something about the strange spirit-powered zombie before making a new plan.</p> <p>Besides, that wind-powered zombie hadn’t shown up the whole time, and none of them could tell where it was. Didn’t people say that two high-leveled zombies would never show up in the same area without trying to kill each other?</p> <p>Did the spirit-powered zombie banish the wind-powered zombie before they arrived?</p> <p>Right at that very moment, as they prepared to withdraw from the battleground, Lin Qiao came out of her space without sensing the outside situation before that, and showed up right on…</p> <p>…the car roof!</p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at Long Qingying’s average-looking but cold face in shock.</p> <p>‘Damn! What’s happening here!’ That was all she could say to herself at that moment.</p> <p>Before she could react, Long Qingying, who was less than half a meter away from her, had already reacted swiftly and pulled out her katana.</p> <p>Clang! The sharp katana was pulled out of the sheath along with an echoing sound. Long Qingying pulled out the katana quickly and neatly, then swung at the zombie which suddenly showed up in front of her.</p> <p>‘Damn! Don’t attack just yet! Can’t we just have a conversation in peace?’ Lin Qiao screamed in her head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slightly turned her body and moved her feet. She didn’t leap off the car roof, but moved slightly and automatically grasped the katana with her claws.</p> <p>Long Qingying was surprised by how nimble Lin Qiao was, but didn’t stop attacking. Instead, she raised a foot to kick at the zombie.</p> <p>Lin Qiao immediately raised a foot to defend herself, then turned her leg to lock Long Qingying’s. After that, she stomped her foot against the car roof and tilted her head to dodge Long Qingying’s metallic hand, which was coming for her head.</p> <p>She felt that she’d probably die if that metallic hand managed to pierce into her head!</p> <p>After raising her other hand to lock the metallic hand of Long Qingying, she finally disabled the latter for launching any new attack.</p> <p>Long Qingying was still holding her katana, but the edge of the katana was gripped in Lin Qiao’s hand. The sharp weapon didn’t hurt Lin Qiao’s palm. On the contrary, she felt quite comfortable holding it.</p> <p>After she disabled Long Qingying from moving, Lin Qiao finally had some time to observe the surrounding environment and figure out what was happening. She had already seen a giant crowd of zombies around the car.</p> <p>“Roar!” Without thinking, she uttered a roar at the zombie crowd, expressing a strong warning to force them to step back.</p> <p>At that point, Long Qingying’s heart had already sunk to the bottom.<br/>\n‘Is this that spirit-powered zombie?’ She asked herself.</p> <p>But still, she didn’t give up on fighting, and her moves continued to be swift. She dropped the katana immediately, and then her fingers turned into five sharp steel thorns, stabbing at Lin Qiao’s head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew exactly what she was going to do, because she wasn’t just holding her. She was also enabled to sense her thoughts by the physical contact between their bodies.</p> <p>Therefore, when Long Qingying dropped her weapon, she loosened her grip and leaped backward. She flipped in the air, then landed stably on the ground.</p> <p>Long Qingying failed to hurt the zombie with her steel claws. She found that within a blink, the zombie had already moved to the ground, standing not far away from the car.</p> <p>“Eh? The zombies stopped…” At that time, Cai Hongqing suddenly widened his eyes and stared at the surrounding zombies in confusion.</p> <p>Long Qingying leaped down from the car and stood in front of Lin Qiao with her back to the car. She held the katana with both hands, eyes fixed on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“It showed up!”</p> <p>Her words immediately caught the attention of the others. They all knew that she was trying to tell them that the spirit-powered zombie had shown up.</p> <p>The people in the car looked at Long Qingying, seeing a weird zombie standing in front of her, three or four meters away. The zombie was looking around, and no one knew what it was looking for.</p> <p>It seemed to be a male zombie, about five feet seven tall, and short-haired. Its face was covered in large brown-colored scars. It was wearing a clean training suit, looking energetic and clean, not as dirty and stinky as the other zombies.</p> <p>Its eyes were dark, sparkling with a cold light.</p> <p>Once it showed up, the surrounding zombies all stopped moving.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and his teammates realized what was happening, all becoming alert.</p> <p>However…</p> <p>…a minute had passed, but the zombie didn’t even glance at them!</p>",
  "Chapter 103: Are You A Zombie? Or A Human?": "<p>Lin Qiao looked around but didn’t see Qiu Lili, then recalled that the latter was a little afraid of human beings. So, she guessed that the latter should be hiding somewhere at the moment.</p> <p>‘Who summoned this giant zombie crowd then?’ she wondered.</p> <p>She didn’t move, and the people in the car didn’t dare to do anything either, as they were afraid of another wave of spiritual attack.</p> <p>So, the battle paused momentarily.</p> <p>While keeping vigilance against the people in the car, Lin Qiao had been trying to locate Qiu Lili. However, she didn’t sense where Qiu Lili was, but grasped the vibe of another zombie, which was very fierce, evil, and bloodthirsty.</p> <p>Judging by the vibe, that wasn’t a good zombie.</p> <p>She thought that the zombie crowd was summoned by Qiu Lili, but after failing to sense the latter vibe, she knew that she was wrong. She hadn’t detected any negative vibe from Qiu Lili so far since she met her. Qiu Lili’s vibe was as clean as her appearance, without any ferocity and thirst for blood.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao now believed that Qiu Lili wouldn’t try to hurt these human beings. Besides, Qiu Lili had disappeared without a trace by now.</p> <p>After sensing the evil zombie’s vibe, she roughly figured out what was going on.</p> <p>These people came here for an unknown reason, and that evil zombie had probably followed them here. After arriving this area, it discovered that the wind-powered zombie was gone, and these human beings stopped.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed the evil zombie’s strong desire toward these human beings.</p> <p>It wanted to eat them all!</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back to look at Long Qingying and her teammates.</p> <p>Once she turned back, Long Qingying and her teammates sensed a weird vibe. They found that the zombie in front of them didn’t seem ready to attack or to be alert. Instead, she stood there quite carelessly, as if she didn’t take them seriously.</p> <p>They felt that they didn’t even exist in that zombie’s eyes. Du Yuanxing and his teammates glanced at each other, then looked at Lin Qiao from head to toe with confusion.</p> <p>“Isn’t it targeting at us?” Asked Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>“It’s so clean! It’s not showering a lot, is it?” The other man didn’t answer his question, but threw out another one while staring at Lin Qiao’s clothes.</p> <p>“Yeah, she’s really clean… Except for those dark eyes, it doesn’t even look like a zombie!” Hearing his words, the others all diverted their attention to Lin Qiao’s appearance.</p> <p>“Eh? That’s true!”</p> <p>“And… Why is she carrying a rifle? Eh? And so many pistols tied around her waist and thighs. When did zombies start learning to use guns?”</p> <p>Hearing the few men talking about her clothes and weapons, Lin Qiao couldn’t help rolling her eyes.</p> <p>Long Qingying did the same thing.</p> <p>After rolling her eyes, Long Qingying paused in shock; she saw the zombie in front of her slightly raise its head to look at the sky, as if saying ‘I’m facing a few idiots’.</p> <p>She could scarcely believe what she saw.</p> <p>Even the cold Long Qingying began losing composure.</p> <p>“Em… Did it just show that despising look to us?” Du Yuanxing abruptly said that because he too noticed that look on Lin Qiao’s face.</p> <p>All the others felt a little speechless at that moment.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rolled her eyes again.</p> <p>“It’s really despising us!” Someone said in the car.</p> <p>The people in the car who had realized that they were disdained by a zombie strangely felt wronged.</p> <p>‘Oh my! You’re a soul-less zombie! Why’re you making a human expression!’ Du Yuanxing shouted in his head.</p> <p>Long Qingying raised her katana to the eye level, as she had lost her patience to continue having a stare-off with this zombie. She then parted her feet and prepared to attack.</p> <p>Once she moved, the people in the car immediately came back to their senses. They now realized that they were all distracted just now, that they were actually paying attention only to the enemy’s clothes and weapons.</p> <p>Right at that moment, the zombie in front of them suddenly took a step backward. It raised its left hand, palm down, then raised its right hand to put a finger against the left palm.</p> <p>The zombie was apparently signaling for them to stop. They all paused subconsciously; then, Long Qingying turned back to look at the ones in the car, her eyes asking a question.</p> <p>‘Is he…a human or a zombie?’ She asked her teammates with her eyes.</p> <p>Earlier on, she had wrestled with the zombie on the car roof. Back then, she had realized that the zombie was using combat skills which weren’t something that zombies should master.</p> <p>And now, seeing the gesture made by the zombie, Long Qingying had even started to doubt herself. She wondered if something had happened to her brain or her eyes that made her feel that this zombie actually looked like a human being.</p> <p>The others looked back at her in confusion, then turned to Lin Qiao.<br/>\nGod knew if they were looking at a zombie or a man.</p> <p>“You… Are you a human or a zombie?” A fast talker among Du Yuanxing’s team suddenly yelled at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt speechless again.</p> <p>She believed that she looked exactly like a zombie. She wanted to cover her eyes with a pair of sunglasses, but sadly, she failed to find any.</p> <p>The man who asked the question without thinking now fell into silence. Sensing the others gazes, he quietly raised his head to look at the sky, then at the earth, and ultimately at his own feet.</p> <p>‘You just tried to talk with a zombie. Do you think it can understand you? Are you expecting its answer?’ His teammates were merely staring at him, but he could hear them asking a series of question.</p> <p>He could also hear them say ‘impossible’, call him ‘idiot’, and ask him if something was wrong with him. But soon, his teammates began to think that something was wrong with themselves as well.</p> <p>That was because they saw that the zombie in front of them suddenly took out a notepad and a pen, and began writing. Du Yuanxing and his teammates widened their eyes in shock, but what happened next was even more unbelievable.</p> <p>The zombie finished writing, then ripped the paper off, wadded it, and it threw at them.</p> <p>The people in the car began to wonder if they were mad or if the world had become crazier. When did zombies learn to write? What was wrong with that zombie?</p> <p>The wad of paper flew at Long Qingying. Lin Qiao was six to seven meters away from the car, so the paper wad shouldn’t be able to fly to them. However, she managed to throw it right into Long Qingying’s hands. Long Qingying caught it, her face filled with confusion.</p> <p>As she caught the paper wad, the people in the car immediately fixed their eyes on her. They were very curious about what was written on the paper.</p> <p>Long Qingying spread the paper and saw a line of clearly written words, as neat as a line of soldiers.</p> <p>‘I’m a zombie, but I don’t kill people! Your target is behind you!’</p> <p>After reading that, Long Qingying and her teammates turned back to look behind them, only to see an extremely ugly, short zombie squatting on a tree, staring at them fiercely with his dark eyes. They didn’t know when it had shown up.</p>",
  "Chapter 104: Sudden Attack": "<p>“Damn! What the hell is this!” The looks in the faces of Du Yuanxing and his teammates changed the moment they saw that big-headed zombie. Some of them even shouted out loud.</p> <p>It was way too disgusting! And, they didn’t even know what it was.</p> <p>Long Qingying was the only one who managed to maintain some composure while observing the four-feet-tall zombie.</p> <p>It had a giant head, four eyes, two noses, and an awfully cracked mouth. Its head was covered in blood and wet hair.</p> <p>Its head looked like a combination of two smashed human heads.</p> <p>‘It’s so gross!’ Long Qingying complained silently.</p> <p>Before Du Yuanxing and his teammates could confirm if this big-headed zombie was the one mentioned by Lin Qiao in her note, the disgusting zombie made a movement.</p> <p>After realizing that everyone on the scene had discovered it, it impatiently opened its mouth wide and uttered a shrill scream, as if worried that Lin Qiao might seize its prey.</p> <p>“Squeak!”</p> <p>Its voice was ear-piercing, and this scream it let out was many times more powerful than the one before.</p> <p>“Pah!” Three or four among Du Yuanxing’s team directly vomited blood and fell to the ground softly. Just now after Lin Qiao showed up, Du Yuanxing and his teammates had all come out of the car, only leaving the unconscious one lying in the car.</p> <p>The rest of the team who managed to stay on their feet suffered badly as well. Their brains were shaken, and after that, they sensed a piercing pain, as if something sharp was stirring inside their heads.</p> <p>Long Qingyung supported her body with the katana and remained standing, but Du Yuanxing, Cai Hongqing, and the other few directly kneeled.</p> <p>All team members were temporarily disabled from fighting.</p> <p>The strange thing was, the sound attack which was even effective on Qiu Lili turned out to be completely useless against Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Roar!” Seeing what happened to Long Qingying and her teammates, the big-headed zombie seized the opportunity to leap down from the tree and pounce on them.</p> <p>‘We’re dead!’</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and his teammates had sensed its movement, but couldn’t make any reaction at that time. They weren’t able to do what they hoped.</p> <p>Long Qingying, who was the strongest one in the team, was still able to raise her katana, but couldn’t manage to make any further movement. Her reaction was slowed down by the sound wave; she knew what to do, but her body parts couldn’t get the orders from her brain timely.</p> <p>Therefore, when they saw the big-headed zombie charge at her and her teammates, she only had time to grip the katana with both hands. But before she raised her weapon, the zombie was already right before her face, as it wasn’t far away before.</p> <p>When the team was about to fall in despair, a roar was suddenly heard.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>A figure flashed across the air and suddenly showed up right beside the big-headed zombie when the latter had almost jumped on Du Yuanxing who was the closest from it. Then, a sharp claw swiftly pierced into the big-headed zombie’s head.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>“Squeak!”</p> <p>A puffing noise was heard, along with a shrill scream.</p> <p>All the others felt that their brains were shaken again. After that, they lost their eyesights temporally, and all blanked out.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>Lin Qiao swung her hand, then looked at the sticky liquid and a blue zombie nucleus in her hand, her face filled with disgust.</p> <p>Following her moves, the big-headed zombie thudded against the ground like a pile of rotten meat.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glance at the zombie nucleus, then at the group of human beings who were lying on the ground. It seemed that the scream uttered by the big-headed zombie before death was quite powerful.</p> <p>But, why didn’t she feel a thing? Was it because she was a zombie?</p> <p>She thought for a moment in confusion, but soon forgot about that question. She began to wonder what she should do with this group of human beings. Since she had met them already, she couldn’t bear to leave them here. Even though she was a zombie now, she still had a soldier’s soul!</p> <p>She looked around, still failed to find a trace of Qiu Lili. She had no idea where had the latter gone to.</p> <p>The zombie crowd which had been remaining motionless the whole time now began moving toward the group of human beings. It was probably because they were affected by the big-headed zombie’s last scream.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n‘Go away!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao bared her teeth and gave them a warning growl.</p> <p>All the ordinary zombies stopped moving immediately, but still lingered in that area without leaving. Of course, they didn’t dare to get any closer either.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked around again. At last, she decided to put the group of people inside the car.</p> <p>She put the zombie nucleus into her pocket, then glanced at her own hands. After that, she directly lifted Long Qingying to put her inside the car.</p> <p>She spent quite a while to get the whole team into the car.</p> <p>At that moment, a white figure showed up standing on the car roof; it was Qiu Lili. After Watching Lin Qiao put all these people into the car, she pointed at them and looked at Lin Qiao with questions in her eyes.</p> <p>‘What are you gonna do with these people now?’ She asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her head to look at Qiu Lili, wondering where she hid just now and didn’t show up until now.</p> <p>She took out the notepad and wrote—’Are you afraid of human beings?’</p> <p>Qiu Lili dropped her eyes and pouted. Then, she turned her back to Lin Qiao without answering the latter’s question.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave a helpless smile.</p> <p>She didn’t understand how Qiu Lili felt about human beings. It might be repulsion, but she felt that Qiu Lili was more like afraid of human beings. In fact, Qiu Lili wanted to be close with human beings, as she used to be one of them. Even now, she just looked like a zombie, yet never killed or ate any human. Even though she now had the zombie virus which might infect human beings, she still wanted to be close with them.</p> <p>However, human beings treated her like a monster only because she was changed in appearance.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the surrounding zombies, then found that they had all begun to draw back like an ebbing tide after Qiu Lili showed up. It was because she had released her strong vibe on showing up.</p> <p>Sensing the vibe of a zombie queen, these ordinary zombies instinctively wanted to leave. It was like how ancient ordinary people saw the high-positioned ones with fear and admiration.</p> <p>As Qiu Lili refused to talk to her, Lin Qiao closed the car doors.</p> <p>She didn’t plan to drive that car. Instead, she sent the car and the people in it all into her space.</p> <p>She couldn’t tell if the nine people could survive or not. Judging by their vibes, they were still alive, but she didn’t know what conditions they were in. She planned to leave them in her space and wait to see if they could wake up or not.</p> <p>When the car disappeared, Qiu Lili lightly landed on the ground. She chose only clean and flat places to step on.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao wrote on the paper—’Let’s go find a hotel building.’</p> <p>She wanted to try finding some beds for those people to lie on. If she couldn’t find any beds, she would have to let them rest on the ground.</p> <p>After reading the note, Qiu Lili pointed at one direction. Earlier on, she had seen a building which looked like a hotel when she was standing high up.</p>",
  "Chapter 105: The Purpose of Saving People": "<p>Lin Qiao moved toward where Qiu Lili pointed at.</p> <p>After two streets and an alley, she came to another block and saw a building which used to be a large hotel. Many of the windows were broken, and the doors had disappeared. But, the good thing was that the building was still undamaged.</p> <p>She walked in through the main entrance of the hotel. The lobby was as messy and dirty as every corner in this post-apocalyptic world. Couches were overturned or scratched broken by some creatures, with the filling sponge exposed. The couches were mostly covered in dried black blood, and so were the floor and the walls.</p> <p>Lin Qiao merely made a quick glance around before walking straight toward the stairs. The zombies in this area were either driven away by the level-four wind-powered zombie, or summoned to the other side by the big-headed zombie. Due to these reasons, Lin Qiao hadn’t seen even one single zombie in this place.</p> <p>This place was quiet and wasted, without any trace of living creatures. Things were covered in a thick layer of dust, showing no sign of being touched. It seemed that before Lin Qiao, no one had visited this place in a long time.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked onto the stairs to find that the stairsteps and walls by the stairs were also stained by dark and dried blood, which clearly explained how chaotic and terrifying it was when the apocalypse had arrived.</p> <p>She walked to the second floor. The corridor on the second floor was also in a mess, and the third floor was mostly the same. Lin Qiao checked a lot of rooms, then finally found a large suite.</p> <p>The suite contained two large beds, couches, and a living room. It was roomy and not so messy, but a little dusty.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked in and locked the door. She walked around in the suite, checking the windows and the bathroom. Then, she walked toward the two beds in the bedrooms. After that, she brought Du Yuanxing and his teammates out of his space one after another.</p> <p>Qiu Lili stood by the entryway which was behind the door. Looking at the thick dust in the room, she didn’t want to walk in.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t care how dusty the beds were. She threw the group of human beings onto the beds, then began checking their physical conditions one after another.</p> <p>First, she looked at the man who had foam on his mouth corners. She reached out a hand to pull up his eyelids and check his eyeballs, then saw that his pupils had expanded slightly.</p> <p>After that, she put a hand against his neck to feel his pulse, finding that his heart was still beating. Then, she checked the others, and the results were similar. However, the ones who possessed strong superpower energy were doing slightly better than the others. The two powerless ordinary men had already fallen in a deep coma. To wake them up, special treatment might be required.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that the lake water in her space might be helpful, but she wasn’t sure. Last time, the lake water cured the little boy who was weak because of malnutrition and starvation, but these people weren’t in the same condition.</p> <p>She wasn’t a doctor, so she didn’t know how to cure people, neither did she have any medicines with her. Therefore, she decided to try the lake water.</p> <p>As for whether these people could survive or not, it would have to rely on their own fate. Trying to heal them with the lake water was all she could do for them under the current situation. After all, it needed over ten hours of driving to get to the nearest human base from here.</p> <p>She planned to try waking the relative stronger ones up with the lake water first, then let them figure out a way to handle this situation.</p> <p>With that thought, she flashed into her space, then came out with a large bowl filled with lake water. After that, she fed the water to the group of people one by one, then began observing them.</p> <p>She was able to see the energy contained in the lake water. Seeing that the energy gathered in the heads of each of them, she guessed that these people were probably hurt by the big-headed zombie’s voice.</p> <p>In fact, apart from her own conscience, she had another reason to try saving these people. Her main purpose of saving them was that she wanted to ask them if they had heard about Lin Feng, Lin Wenwen, Lin Hao, Huang Mei, and Cheng Wangyue.</p> <p>She knew that these people were from the Hades Base, which was the nearest Southern base from here.</p> <p>Now, she needed to wait and see if these people could wake up,</p> <p>Qiu Lili stood by the door for a while. After watching Lin Qiao checking these people and feeding them lake water, she walked over and pulled her arm.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back to look at her with confusion, wondering what she wanted to say.</p> <p>Qiu Lili made a gesture of writing, and Lin Qiao immediately handed her the notepad and the pen.</p> <p>Qiu Lili took over the pen and paper, then began writing—’Even if you save them, they won’t be grateful. They’ll still kill you and me.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao read the note, then spent a short while thinking about what Qiu Lili meant. She guessed that the latter too had tried helping human beings before, but those people found out that she was a zombie and were tempted to kill her.</p> <p>Maybe because the distance between her and Qiu Lili was quite close, or the latter was emotional at the moment, Lin Qiao could sense her sadness for being abandoned and harmed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed, then wrote on the paper—’It’s alright. I don’t expect them to accept me. I just want to ask them about a few people. I’m not helping them for nothing. If they requite my kindness with enmity, we can just leave.’</p> <p>‘Even if there will be a fight, you and I won’t lose. So, why should we worry so much?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao was thinking this way.</p> <p>Qiu Lili fell into silence after reading the note. She walked to the window side and stood behind the window to watch the scenery of the post-apocalyptic world.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her, but didn’t write another word for her. Then, she turned to walk back to the beds and check the pockets of the few men. She needed a pair of sunglasses now, so she wondered if any of these people had one. If they did have ibe, she would take one from them as the reward for saving them. She wasn’t demanding a high price at all.</p> <p>So, she rummaged their pockets without any bad feelings. To her surprise, she found a pair from around Du Yuanxing’s waist.</p> <p>‘He does have a sunglasses!’</p> <p>She took Du Yuanxing’s sunglasses with surprise and then wore it.</p> <p>It was not bad! The sunglasses were purely dark, but worked just fine for the black and white world in Lin Qiao’s eyes.</p> <p>After finding the sunglasses, she leaned against the wall and looked at the people on the beds.</p> <p>A couple of minutes passed…half an hour…one hour…</p> <p>After waiting for two whole hours, she finally saw that Long Qingying slightly moved her eyebrows.</p> <p>‘She’s awake!’</p> <p>Long Qingying opened her eyes frowningly, then sat up with one hand pressing against her forehead. Only after that she noticed the surrounding environment and looked around alertly.</p> <p>Then, she saw Lin Qiao, who was standing less than two meters away, and the young female zombie in a white dress in the living room.</p> <p>She automatically tried to pull out her katana when seeing these two zombies. However, she touched around her waist and found nothing. After that, she realized that she had been lying there the whole time, and if the zombies wanted to hurt her, they should have done it long ago.</p> <p>She hurriedly checked her own body. After finding nothing wrong, she turned to the others while Lin Qiao kept looking at her quietly.</p> <p>Long Qingying confirmed that all her teammates were fine, then turned toward the latter again.</p>",
  "Chapter 106: The Trade Between Human and Zombie": "<p>Long Qingying silently turned to glance at Du Yuanxing when she saw the sunglasses worn on Lin Qiao’s face. After that, she turned back to continue staring at Lin Qiao while trying to ask her a question, “Did you…save us?”</p> <p>Long Qingying remembered that before she passed out, the short big-headed zombie had already charged at her and her teammates while they were incapable of reacting. At that time, she had known that she was in danger, but couldn’t manage to fight back.</p> <p>She also saw that a claw stopped the big-headed zombie and pierced into its head swiftly, fiercely, and accurately. After that, the big-headed zombie uttered a shrill scream which knocked her and her teammates out.</p> <p>She observed the surrounding environment, then realized that she was in a hotel room. The decorations in the room continued to be the same as before the apocalypse. The room was untidy and dusty, meaning that no one had been here before.</p> <p>Long Qingying tried to talk to Lin Qiao because the latter had written her and her teammates a note before. Since she understood that Lin Qiao knew how to communicate, she decided to try building a conversation with her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao calmly nodded at her.</p> <p>Looking at the sunglasses that she was wearing, Long Qingying continued with confusion, “You’re a zombie…But, why can you understand our words? You can write, and you saved us. Are you really a zombie?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao directly showed her claws.</p> <p>“So why did you save us? Shouldn’t you be eating us? Don’t all zombies eat human beings?” Long Qingying asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked up the notepad and began writing with patience—’I’m a zombie, but I’m different from ordinary zombies. I don’t need to feed on human beings. I saved you because I need to ask you about a few people.’</p> <p>Finishing writing, she approached Long Qingying with the notepad.</p> <p>The latter automatically moved backward. Even though the zombie hadn’t shown any hostility, she didn’t dare to let it get close to her. After all, zombies were spreading the virus, and were all highly dangerous.</p> <p>Seeing Long Qingying’s move, Lin Qiao stopped moving. She had no other choice but to step back, rip the piece of paper off the notepad and wad it up, then throw it at Long Qingying.</p> <p>Long Qingying caught it, then unwrapped and read the note. After that, she raised her head to look at Lin Qiao and asked, “You…Are really different from the other zombies. Who do you want to know about?”</p> <p>As Lin Qiao prepared to write the names of her mother, brothers, and sisters, Du Yuanxing, who was lying on the other bed, woke up as well.</p> <p>“Em… Ouch…” he moaned in pain, then took a deep breath. After that, he sat up from the bed with a twisted face.</p> <p>“What happened… this place is… Oh! My sunglasses!” He sat up and raised his head to look around, then saw Lin Qiao, who was standing by the bedside wearing his sunglasses. He recognized his sunglasses immediately. To confirm, he touched the bag around his waist and found that it was as empty as he had thought.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him and curved her lips to give him a smile. As a result, her white and sharp teeth were exposed.</p> <p>After becoming a zombie, her smile had become awfully scary, and she couldn’t do anything to change that.</p> <p>Seeing her sharp teeth, Du Yuanxing somehow sensed a coldness from his heart. So, he silently turned his eyes away from Lin Qiao’s face to Long Qingying.</p> <p>Long Qingying stood up, moving toward Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>“What’s going on? Why are we here?” As Long Qingying came to him, Du Yuanxing stood up as well and asked with a low voice.</p> <p>“Didn’t you see it? He saved us,” Long Qingying fixed her eyes on Lin Qiao while responding, also with a low voice.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing was confused. “Is he a zombie or a man? Why did he save us?” He asked.</p> <p>Long Qingying rolled her eyes. ‘He has admitted that he’s a zombie before, so isn’t it a little dumb for you to ask this question now?’ She thought.</p> <p>“Zombie…He saved us, and he has requirements.” Long Qingying believed that asking for information could be counted as a requirement.</p> <p>“What requirements? Does he want to eat us one by one?” Du Yuanxing asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rolled her eyes and couldn’t help but click her tongue. She felt that this man was a little silly.</p> <p>Long Qingying didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>She felt that Du Yuanxing’s brain might not have started working since he just woke up. Therefore, she didn’t answer the man’s question, but looked at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Who do you want to know about?” She asked.</p> <p>Hearing what Long Qingying had said, Du Yuanxing learned that the zombie’s requirement was to ask about some people. So, he sighed in relief, then realized that he should check his own body condition.</p> <p>What people feared the most about leaving the bases for action was to be infected by the zombie virus. The slightest infection could cost them their lives. Therefore, they all needed to try their best and prevent any possibility of infection from happening.</p> <p>For example, they couldn’t let themselves be scratched or bitten by zombies, or eat mutant plants, or be attacked by zombie beasts or other mutant creatures.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing checked his own body over and over again, and found nothing wrong. Except for the slight dull ache in his head, he was perfectly unharmed.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao was writing—’Have you heard about Lin Feng, Huang Mei, Lin Wenwen, and Lin Hao?’</p> <p>Finishing writing, she wadded the paper up and threw it at Long Qingying again.</p> <p>Long Qingying caught the paper wad and unwrapped it. Du Yuanxing moved over to read the note as well. After that, he turned to Lin Qiao with confusion.</p> <p>“Do you know them? Why are you looking for them?” He asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded. Of course, she knew them. Those people were her family. Even though she had changed into a different creature, they were still her family.</p> <p>She was looking for them because she wanted to know their current situation and what kind of a life they were now living.</p> <p>From Du Yuanxing’s tone, Lin Qiao had sensitively detected his vigilance.</p> <p>She looked at Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying with confusion. The expression in Du Yuanxing’s face had apparently told her that he knew her family. But, she didn’t quite understand the vigilance in his eyes.</p> <p>That seemed to be an awareness of protection.</p> <p>Not only did Du Yuanxing and his team know Lin Feng and his family, they were also trying to protect them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that the looks in the faces of Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing were a little strange. She knew well enough about her own brother, who wasn’t a weak person. Even if he didn’t become a superpowered man, surviving in the post-apocalyptic world wouldn’t be a difficult thing for him, because he used to be a battalion commander.</p> <p>He was an even more experienced soldier than herself. So, he would be strong enough to protect himself and his family.</p> <p>However, judging by the looks of Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing, Lin Qiao now felt that Lin Feng and his family weren’t in a good situation. The vigilance in the eyes of Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing was strangely strong, as if she would do something to Lin Feng and his families.</p> <p>‘No, their vigilance isn’t against me, but against many people!’ Lin Qiao then thought. ‘Have my families encountered any trouble in the base?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed a lot of things from the expressions and emotions of Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing. What allowed her to do that wasn’t only her keen judgment as a soldier, but also that her mind-reading ability having grown further stronger.</p> <p>“Can you tell us what’s your relationship with Lin Feng?” Long Qingying asked frowningly.</p>",
  "Chapter 107: The Information In Exchange": "<p><em>‘He was my friend and commander’— </em>Lin Qiao wrote on the paper.</p> <p>She felt that Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing might know Lin Feng, but couldn’t tell for sure if they knew that he had a sister named Lin Qiao. Therefore, she didn’t give them her own name, but lied to them that she used to be Lin Feng’s friend and subordinate.</p> <p>It was reasonable enough for her to care about her old friend and commander.</p> <p>Long Qingying read the note, then looked at Lin Qiao and asked, “‘Was’? Do you mean that before you became a zombie?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded.</p> <p>“It’s hard for us to trust you at the moment,” said Du Yuanxing abruptly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao crossed her arms before her chest. She didn’t mind their negative attitude, but nodded in agreement with Du Yuanxing’s words. If she were them, she wouldn’t trust a strange zombie who suddenly showed up either.</p> <p>So, she continued writing— <em>‘You can choose not to believe me, but I’m willing to trade for their information with this.’</em></p> <p>Finishing writing, Lin Qiao took out the zombie nucleus in her pocket. She was planning to do another treatment in the center of the lake in her space with this zombie nucleus, as she hoped that the third energy treatment would be able to erase the scars on her face.</p> <p>Seeing the blue zombie nucleus in her hand, both Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing had their eyes glowing.</p> <p>The blue color meant that this nucleus belonged to a level-four zombie. This zombie nucleus was enough to buy a great deal of food and water in the base, and a level-four zombie nucleus was exactly the purpose of their journey here.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wrapped the zombie nucleus in notepaper, then threw it to Long Qingying. The latter caught the paper wad easily.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing stared straight at the zombie nucleus in Long Qingying’s hand, as if he could no longer see anything else.</p> <p>However, Long Qingying immediately stopped Du Yuanxing from saying any word, but said to Lin Qiao, “How can we know if you will try hurting them or not after getting their information? If you’re going after them, we can’t sell you the information.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave a faint smile, then wrote her another note.</p> <p><em>‘You can choose not to tell me, but I can go ask other people. And, if you’re not telling me anything, I’m gonna take that zombie nucleus back.’</em></p> <p>It would be fine even if she failed to make a deal with Long Qingying and her team, because she could always ask other human beings. She had learned from the Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing’ reactions that Lin Feng and his family were rather famous in this area, so it would be much easier for her to ask around about them.</p> <p>Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing glanced at each other, then both of their hearts sank. Lin Qiao was right. As long as she found another group of human beings, she would be able to learn about the current situation of Lin Feng and his families. And, whatever the zombie’s purpose was, they couldn’t stop it from happening.</p> <p>They couldn’t stop the zombie now, as they were clearly no match for her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was sensing the changes of Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing’ emotions. She wasn’t able to detect their thoughts precisely, but could guess some of their thoughts based on their emotions.</p> <p>Earlier on, she thought that her mind-reading ability had grown stronger; but now, she felt that it wasn’t working so well on these two human beings in front of her. She couldn’t sense their thoughts clearly, and wondered if it was because both of them were level-five superpowered ones and had very strong awareness of defense.</p> <p>Afterward, Du Yuanxing turned his eyes away from the zombie nucleus to Lin Qiao, then said, “Lin Feng and his families were nice to us. So, if you’re planning to hurt them, we can’t possibly give you the information. You need to at least give us something to prove that you won’t try harming them.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment. How should she prove that? She had no way to prove that…</p> <p>As even a level-four zombie nucleus had failed to make them relax their vigilance, Lin Qiao guessed that it wouldn’t be easy for her to get the information from them. In this case, she decided to use plan B.</p> <p>The wrote on the notepad—’Since there’s no deal, please give the zombie nucleus back to me. I’ll go ask someone else. I saved you because it was convenient, so you’re welcome.’</p> <p>Then, she threw note to Long Qingying and spread her palm toward her.</p> <p>Long Qingying clenched the zombie nucleus, then turned back to Du Yuanxing. She couldn’t make the decision.</p> <p>She didn’t trust Lin Qiao, so she wasn’t planning to tell her about Lin Feng and his families. However, she couldn’t decide to give the zombie nucleus back to the zombie or not. After all, she had already been paid, and now, she was just doing her job. As the captain of the team, Du Yuanxing was the only one who had the right to decide.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing grabbed the zombie nucleus from Long Qingying’s hand, gripping it and staring at it. After that, he raised his head to look at Lin Qiao, then at Long Qingying. The look in his eyes was constantly changing, as he seemed to be struggling. However, he gripped the zombie nucleus tight the whole time.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t rush him, but let him try convincing himself.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing hesitated for a while, then clenched his teeth and showed determination on his face. “I can only tell you that they’re no longer in the Hades Base. Except for the Chief, the others are all alive. Is that good enough?”</p> <p>“Du Yuanxing!” Seeing that Du Yuanxing had given out the information about Lin Feng and his family for the zombie nucleus, Long Qingying glared at him, her face turning cold.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing didn’t respond to her, but stared straight at Lin Qiao. He wanted very much to see Lin Qiao’s eyes, but the only thing he saw were the sunglasses which used to belong to himself.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, sensing that Du Yuanxing didn’t lie. Even though the information wasn’t in detail, it was enough. She would verify it and collect more information by herself.</p> <p>While thinking, she turned and walked to Qiu Lili, gently patting her on the back, then walking toward the outside.</p> <p>Qiu Lili turned back to glance at her, then at Du Yuanxing, Long Qingying, and the people who were still lying unconsciously on the beds. After that, she directly leaped out of the window and disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced back as well, then kept moving. She unlocked the door, then left the room. <em>‘People who can do Qinggong always like to fly out of windows, like the ancient martial artists…’ </em>she thought while walking.</p> <p>In fact, Lin Qiao never wanted to get that zombie nucleus back when she gave it to them. She only said that so that Du Yuanxing would tell her something about her family. Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying tried to defend her family, so she was willing to give the zombie nucleus to them.</p> <p>Seeing the two zombies leave quietly and neatly, Du Yuanxing paused slightly. After that, he realized something on looking at Lin Qiao’s straight back.</p> <p>She looked like a human being instead of a zombie from the back.</p> <p>“Did you have to sell Chief’s families for this zombie nucleus?” After Lin Qiao disappeared, Long Qingying asked Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing’s face darkened as well. He responded with, “Don’t make it sound so awful. I didn’t sell Captain and his families. I just told the zombie that they’re no longer in the base. He would be able to find out about it very easily, because everyone knows that. If we refused to give him any information, he’d give the nucleus to other people. So, why can’t I take it? Do you know how much food can this zombie nucleus buy? And how many days it’ll last us for?”</p> <p>His words made a lot of sense, so Long Qingying didn’t know what to say. She just stared at him, remaining silent.</p>",
  "Chapter 108: Eavesdrop in the Invisible State": "<p>Du Yuanxing sighed and said, “Why are you so nervous? I don’t think that the zombie has any bad intentions. Otherwise, he wouldn’t treat us so politely. He even gave up a zombie nucleus. He could have used this nucleus to improve his own strength quite largely. Besides, I didn’t tell him where Captain and his families are heading to. Just let him go find out himself.”</p> <p>“Em,” Long Qingying was still angry at him, so she only responded with a sound.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing looked at the door and sighed again, “It has only been five years since the apocalypse, but some zombies have already become so smart. Do you think those two zombies can destroy the entire base?”</p> <p>“If you’re worrying that he might destroy the base, you can go kill him now,” said Long Qingying.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing shrugged and said, “I’m not strong enough to do that. Besides, why do we have to assume that he’ll destroy human bases? Perhaps, he’ll work with human beings. Just like what we did earlier.”</p> <p>Long Qingying glanced at him and asked, “Do you think that’s possible?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing pondered shortly, then responded, “Why not? Human beings are in lack of supplies, so it would be good if zombies could trade quilts and clothes with us.”</p> <p>Long Qingying glanced at him again and asked, “Trade for what? Human flesh?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing didn’t know how to continue this conversation. It seemed that they really didn’t have much to give the zombies in exchange, except for living human beings.</p> <p>So, he sighed once again and said, “I wonder how Captain Lin Feng and his people are doing now. Fortunately, Chief had planned ahead and sent Lin Yu and the others to scout Sea City. If Captain and his people manage to escape successfully, they’ll have somewhere to go in Sea City.”</p> <p>Long Qingying walked to a window and looked outside. She didn’t continue Du Yuanxing’s topic, but said, “We can head back when they’re awake.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing glanced at the others who were all still unconscious. Then, he looked at the door which was closed by Lin Qiao, and walked over to lock it.</p> <p>“Since we’ve got the nucleus, we can head back indeed. We failed to get the nucleus of the wind-powered zombie, but this nucleus of the big-headed zombie is good enough too. Even though it was only a newly upgraded level-four superpowered zombie, it had the rare spirit power. So, its nucleus can also buy a satisfying amount of food.” Du Yuanxing said while looking at the zombie nucleus in his hand.</p> <p>“Why isn’t the wind-powered zombie that you mentioned before here?” Long Qingying asked.</p> <p>“I don’t know. This area was the wind-powered zombie’s territory indeed, but this time, we encountered a spirit-powered level-four zombie and two strange ones of unknown levels. I guess that the wind-powered zombie has been killed already,” Du Yuanxing thought for a moment, then replied, with Long Qingying nodding in agreement.</p> <p>After deciding to head back, the two of them stayed in the room with their teammates.</p> <p>Soon, Du Yuanxing noticed that the window wasn’t closed, so he immediately walked over to close it, in case some zombies at level two or three sneakily crawled in.</p> <p>However, neither Du Yuanxing nor Long Qingying knew that earlier on, Lin Qiao had quietly crawled back in through the window right after she left. Of course, she was invisible at the moment.</p> <p>So, she heard everything that Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying said after she left.</p> <p>However, even though she had heard everything they said, she didn’t quite understand some of their words. But still, she managed to learn a few things.</p> <p>She learned that her brother was now heading to Sea City. And, he wasn’t alone, but with his whole family.</p> <p>It seemed that her brother was being hunted by some people, but she was still unclear about his current situation. Du Yuanxing said that ‘if they managed to escape successfully, they’d have somewhere to go in Sea City’, which meant they hadn’t escaped successfully by now. But, who were hunting her brother?</p> <p>The last thing she learned was that one of her family members seemed to have become a base leader. Was Du Yuanxing talking about the Hades Base? And, who was that person?</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that these few pieces of information were quite important.</p> <p>If a member of her family had become a base leader, he or she must be especially powerful. After all, no one was able to become a base leader without a strong superpower and physical strength.</p> <p>But, how could a base leader be murdered? And, was her brother really running toward Sea City with her other family members? Sea City was so far away, and they needed to go through dangerous zombie crowds all the way to get there. So, how powerful were the enemies that not even a base leader was strong enough to defend against them?</p> <p>And, Lin Qiao hadn’t yet heard anything about the ‘Chief’ from Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying. Who was that person who managed to lead a base?</p> <p>As the invisible Lin Qiao was thinking about all kinds of questions, Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing had stopped talking. Instead, they were patiently observing their teammates who were still in a coma. Lin Qiao guessed that they would be leaving once their teammates woke up.</p> <p>She got a little anxious, because she really wanted to know what exactly had happened to her brother, and what situation were her mother, Wenwen, Hao, Lu, and her sister-in-law in. However, Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing had been keeping an extra strong vigilance against her, so she couldn’t show up directly to ask them about what she wanted to know.</p> <p>And, the strange thing was that she came from Sea City, but didn’t meet Lin Feng and her other family members on her way. Did they miss each other? If so, she now needed to find out which exact way they had been taking. As they were on the run, they would certainly try their best to hide their traces.</p> <p>While the anxious Lin Qiao was trying to keep patience and Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying were waiting for their teammates to wake up, another motorcade was coming this way.</p> <p>Those were two heavily armored military vehicles. Each of these two vehicles were strong enough to crush a thousand ordinary zombies.</p> <p>“Captain, my intel can’t be wrong. Long Qingying came this way with Du Yuanxing and his team. I knew that a level-four wind-powered zombie exists in this area. Du Yuanxing can’t handle it on his own, so he asked Long Qingying for help.”</p> <p>“My mission is to kill Long Qingying. I don’t care about any level-four wind-powered zombie or Du Yuanxing. Since Long Qingying has helped Lin Wenwen and her families, she’s our enemy. Everyone who disagreed to build the new base and has tried helping Lin Feng and his people is our target. Letting them live will only affect the establishment of the new base in a bad way.”</p> <p>“Yes, yes, yes… I know, I know. That’s exactly why I told you about Long Qingying’s whereabouts as soon as I could. You see how loyal am I to the new base?”</p> <p>“That’s good. You’ve shown your loyalty, so the new base won’t mistreat you, and the other survivors who chose to stay.”</p> <p>“Deputy Chief Yang is going after Lin Feng this time. I wonder if he can successfully kill Lin Feng and the others. Those two women were so proud in the old base, but now, aren’t they both going to fall in Deputy Chief Yang’s hands?”</p> <p>“What do you mean by Deputy Chief? Eh?”</p> <p>“Ah-oh, it’s Chief Yang! Chief Yang!”</p> <p>“You’re smart! He’ll definitely get Lin Feng. And this time, another level-six superpowered one is helping him. I don’t think our new leader will fail to kill Lin Feng and the others.”</p>",
  "Chapter 109: Who’s ‘Chief’?": "<p>The two vehicles stopped about a mile away from where Du Yuanxing and his team were. No one came out of the vehicles. Instead, some people in the car were talking via interphones.</p> <p>“Go and see what they’re doing. Remember to hide. Don’t alert the enemy or let them run.”</p> <p>“Copy!”</p> <p>“Let’s go!”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!”</p> <p>At that moment, Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying, who were brought to the hotel room by Lin Qiao, had no idea that some enemies were coming for them quietly. They were still waiting for their seven teammates to wake up.</p> <p>Before long, a small squad of soldiers in camouflage clothes and mufflers on their guns were scouting the surrounding area while avoiding the ordinary zombies nearby. When they found some zombies that were hard to dodge, they’d blow their heads with bullets.</p> <p>Soon, following the dead bodies of zombies which piled on the road, they found the spot where Du Yuanxing and his team were saved by Lin Qiao. Next, they checked the surrounding environment and the dead zombies in that area, including the big-headed zombie which was killed by Lin Qiao with one single claw movement.</p> <p>“It was a level-four spirit-powered zombie,” the squad leader pointed at the dead big-headed zombie and said.</p> <p>“Captain, how did you know that?” A soldier beside him asked out of curiosity.</p> <p>“I heard from others that high-level spirit-powered zombies are all short and big-headed. Look at its body! It seems that it was the combination of two zombies. I heard that this kind of zombies can’t move quickly, so they always disable their targets from moving with long-range attacks first, then show up, bite their targets to death, and eat them. But, this kind of spirit-powered zombies are scarce, so their nuclei are precious.”</p> <p>“Did Du Yuanxing and his people kill it? Eh? Wasn’t their target the wind-powered zombie? How come it became a spirit-powered one?”</p> <p>“I think some unexpected changes have happened. It seems that they’ve already gotten the zombie nucleus. Perhaps, the wind-powered zombie has already been killed by this spirit-powered one. After all, two high-level zombies can never show up in the same place at the same time.”</p> <p>“I see!”</p> <p>“Alright, cut the crap. Let’s go find out where did they go. The mission is our top priority.”</p> <p>“Copy!”</p> <p>After checking around, this squad of soldiers headed to the surrounding areas to look for more leads. Since they had confirmed that Du Yuanxing and his team have been in this place not long ago, they believed that their targets were still nearby.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying failed to discover that some people were approaching them. However, the invisible Lin Qiao, who was in the room, and Qiu Lili, who was on the roof, had both sensed the scents of another group of human beings.</p> <p>Without a doubt, only zombies could sense the scents of human beings so quickly. Some creatures were able to hide their vibes, but no creature could hide their scents.</p> <p>Besides, Lin Qiao’s sense of smell was already sharper than that of dogs by many times over. Therefore, even though the window was closed, she still sensed those newcomers.</p> <p>She raised her head and gently moved to the window side, then put her nose near the gap between window glasses to sense the scents more clearly.</p> <p>She knitted her brows, as she didn’t know who those newcomers were. Earlier on, she had put Du Yuanxing’s car downstairs for them to use after waking up; but now, she was afraid that it might be discovered soon.</p> <p>As she had thought, the scents and the vibes of the newcomers soon began getting closer.</p> <p>At that moment, Du Yuanxing still knew nothing about that. He looked at Long Qingying’s grim face and couldn’t help but say to her, “I know you’re close with Chief’s little sister. But, since you care so much about her, why didn’t you go with them? You’re not weak, so you’re able to help them on the way. Isn’t that true?”</p> <p>Hearing his words, Long Qingying only raised her head to give him a glance, then turned her eyes to a corner without saying anything.</p> <p>In fact, she did plan to go with them. However, Lin Wenwen didn’t let her go, because the journey was too dangerous, and she didn’t want her to get involved.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing thought for a moment, then continued, “It’s not because that Lin Wenwen didn’t let you go, is it? The number of enemies is huge, and all of them are pretty strong. I heard that a level-six powerful being from the Earth Dragon Base is helping them. Including Yang Jianhua, that’d be two level-six people. You two were so close, so I guess she didn’t want you to get involved in, right?”</p> <p>Hearing Lin Wenwen’s name, Lin Qiao, who was standing by the window, immediately turned her head back.</p> <p>Chief’s sister? Lin Wenwen? The name of Lin Qiao’s little sister was Lin Wenwen. If this Lin Wenwen was with Lin Feng, then she must be Lin Qiao’s sister. According to Du Yuanxing, Lin Feng was ‘Captain’, but he hadn’t mentioned the name of ‘Chief’ yet. So, who was this ‘Chief’?</p> <p>Lin Wenwen was the third children of her family, which meant that she was the younger sister of two people—Lin Feng and Lin Qiao.</p> <p>And, Lin Qiao didn’t know Long Qingying, so she guessed that Lin Wenwen met her after the apocalypse and became friends with her.</p> <p>Based on what Du Yuanxing said, Lin Wenwen was Chief’s little sister, but Lin Feng wasn’t ‘Chief’, which meant…</p> <p>Suddenly, Lin Qiao began wondering if the Hades Base used to have a person named Lin Qiao, and would she be the murdered ‘Chief’.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing had mentioned before that except for ‘Chief’, Lin Feng and all his family members were still alive. Lin Qiao felt that she should have asked him about who ‘Chief’ was, and how did she die. And, Long Qingying had accused Du Yuanxing of selling ‘Chief’s family because of a zombie nucleus. By ‘family’, she was talking about Lin Feng and the others. So, who on earth was ‘Chief’.</p> <p>Was the truth really what she thought it was? Was ‘Chief’ another Lin Qiao? Her other self?</p> <p>The more Lin Qiao heard from Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying, the more questions she had.</p> <p>She now knew that Lin Feng and her other family members were heading to Sea City. If she started moving in the same direction right now, she might be able to catch up with them soon. Even though locating Lin Feng and the others might be a little difficult for her, finding the ones who had been chasing them would be easy. After locating those people, she would be able to find her family soon.</p> <p>However, she now felt that it was important for her to figure out who ‘Chief’ was. She wanted to know if ‘Chief’ was another Lin Qiao, as that idea made her feel extremely strange! But at the same time, she also felt that she should start catching up with her family, who were highly important to her as well.</p> <p>She needed to make a choice as soon as possible. Perhaps, she should show her face and ask Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying about ‘Chief’s name.</p> <p>But at that moment, the suspicious newcomers seemed to have found out that Long Qingying and her teammates were here, as they had started surrounding this area.</p> <p>Long Qingying didn’t give Du Yuanxing any response. Right at that time, one among the people lying on beds woke up.</p> <p>“Em… My head hurts! This place? Eh, where is this place? Captain, why are we in a… hotel suite?” Cai Hongqing, who had just woken up, sat up with a headache, then looked around and asked.</p>",
  "Chapter 110: Unknown Enemies Are Here": "<p>Cai Hongqing woke up to find that he was lying in a room with closed door and window, surrounded by his teammates; so, he wasn’t too nervous. After shaking his head, he asked the two standing by the bed about what had happened.</p> <p>“Hey, you’re awake! How’re you feeling? Do you feel waves of a dull ache in the head?” Seeing him sit up, Du Yuanxing asked.</p> <p>Cai Hongqing felt exactly what Du Yuanxing had said. He paused slightly, the nodded and said, “Yeah. Eh? Is everyone else in a coma?” While speaking, he turned to the others lying on the beds.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing sighed with relief, then said, “Then, you’re okay. Just stand up… you’ll feel better soon.”</p> <p>Cai Hongqing looked around and found that he was in a large hotel suite. “Eh? Did you get us here? Didn’t you pass out?” He asked abruptly.</p> <p>When he woke up, everyone else was unconscious except for Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying; so he thought it was them who moved the whole team into this hotel suite.</p> <p>However, he also wondered how did the two of them manage to avoid so many zombies and get the whole team here.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying shook their heads simultaneously.</p> <p>“No, I was unconscious too. She woke up before I did,” while speaking, Du Yuanxing glanced at Long Qingying.</p> <p>Long Qingying glanced back at him, but didn’t say a word. Both she and Du Yuanxing knew that it was two zombies who get them here. As for how did the two zombies manage to do that, they didn’t know.</p> <p>“Eh? Even you passed out? And you didn’t pass out too, did you?” Cai Hongqing looked at Du Yuanxing with surprise, then at Long Qingying.</p> <p>He didn’t think that the scream of the spirit-powered zombie could be powerful enough to throw the whole team into unconsciousness.</p> <p>“Eh? Did the writing zombie kill the big-headed zombie? I remember that the writing zombie had stopped the big-headed zombie.” While thinking about the big-headed zombie’s sound attack, Cai Hongqing recalled how it had pounced on his team. He and the rest of the team all saw that the writing zombie made a movement to stop the big-headed zombie at the last moment. That was the last thing he could remember.</p> <p>While Cai Hongqing was speaking, Long Qingying who stood beside him suddenly had her expression changed. She blinked, then turned to walk to the window side and alertly looked out through the gap between the windowpanes. After that, she put her ear near the window to hear something.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?” Du Yuanxing and Cai Hongqing were confused by her movements. Long Qingying frowned slightly and said in a serious tone, “I think some people are coming this way. There’re about… twenty of them.”</p> <p>Hearing her words, both Du Yuanxing and Cai Hongqing wore a serious look and were fully alert. The latter immediately got off the bed and stared at Long Qingying.</p> <p>Long Qingying spent a short while sensing clearly, then turned to nod at the two and said, “They’re coming for us indeed, and they’re not far away. Let’s just wake them up now.”</p> <p>Once she said that, Du Yuanxing and Cai Hongqing began waking their teammates up by shaking their shoulders and slapping their faces.</p> <p>“Wake up! Wake up!”</p> <p>Most of the others had recovered from the spirit-powered zombie’s attack, and were soon woken up by Du Yuanxing and Cai Hongqing, except for two.</p> <p>“Eh… What’s going on?”</p> <p>“This place is…”</p> <p>“Ah… My head hurts so much!”</p> <p>“Zombie! The spirit-power zombie is attacking us!”</p> <p>The people who just woke up had yet to find out what was happening. One of them still had the scene of the big-headed zombie attacking in his head, so he began yelling and struggling once waking up.</p> <p>“What zombie! There’s no zombie now! Wake up!” Du Yuanxing pressed his hand on this man’s head and said impatiently.</p> <p>“No zombie… Eh? What is this place?” Asked that man.</p> <p>“That’s not important. There’re people coming at us. I don’t think they’ll be friendly. Get up and clear your heads!” Du Yuanxing yelled at the few still confused ones.</p> <p>Hearing his words, the others instantly braced themselves up and began looking around. Soon, they had made their own judgments.</p> <p>Long Qingying had been looking out through the window. As she expected, she soon saw some people moving in the shaded areas, surrounding the hotel building from all directions.</p> <p>This place used to be dominated by the wind-powered zombie, so no other zombies existed here. The ones summoned by the big-headed zombie earlier wouldn’t loiter to this area so fast either.</p> <p>Besides, Lin Qiao had kept Du Yuanxing and his teammates in her space before putting them in this suite, so no scents of living human beings were left in the air. Therefore, the surrounding zombies wouldn’t know that a few human beings were hiding in this place.</p> <p>However, when Long Qingying saw some nimbly-moving people moving toward the hotel building, she also found a group of zombies which followed those people’s scents here.</p> <p>After seeing those people’s clothes clearly, Long Qingying’s heart sank.</p> <p>“It’s an army from the base. I think this squad is here to scout,” she said.</p> <p>“Army? Why are they coming for us? We’re free to come out hunting zombies. That has nothing to do with them, right?”</p> <p>Long Qingying looked outside, remaining silent.</p> <p>“They might not be coming for us,” someone said. Hearing him, the others all glanced at Long Qingying and figured out something.</p> <p>“Yeah, they should be here for you,” Du Yuanxing said while walking to another window to look outside.</p> <p>At that moment, Long Qingying found that those people had stopped moving forward at the distance of twenty or thirty meters from the building and hidden themselves. It seemed that they weren’t planning to rush in and directly start a fight.</p> <p>“Eh? Why did they stop?” Du Yuanxing had noticed that too.</p> <p>“They’re here to scout. They stopped because they’ve located us. Now, they’re reporting to their commander and waiting for their next order,” Long Qingying said in a flat tone.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing looked at her and said abruptly, “If they’re really coming for us, you should be their target. Why don’t you take the opportunity to leave now? You’re powerful, so they can’t stop you from leaving at the moment. If you wait longer, more powerful enemies might show up.”</p> <p>Long Qingying turned back to glance at him and respond, “Are you sure about that? Aren’t these people guided here by the traitor from your team? If it is him, I don’t think these people will leave you alone even if I’m not here. Not to mention that you’re now holding a level-four zombie nucleus.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing didn’t know what to say, because Long Qingying was probably right. What she said was highly likely to be true. Besides, they hired Long Qingying as a fighter, and if they let her leave right now, they might fall in serious disadvantages.</p>",
  "Chapter 111: Pull Out First": "<p>“Captain, Long Qingying is right. It must be that b*stard who brought those soldiers here. Otherwise, how could they be so fast? We’ve only been here for a while, but they’ve already found us.”</p> <p>Reminded by Long Qingying, the rest of the team was inclined to believe in that possibility as well.</p> <p>“So, what should we do now? Perhaps, they haven’t found out that we have a level-four zombie nucleus,” Du Yuanxing still had a slight hope in his heart.</p> <p>A level-four zombie nucleus could buy a large amount of food. In the post-apocalyptic era, zombie nuclei were the best kind of treasures.</p> <p>However, this chaotic era had no rules or laws; power was the only principle here. The weak were the prey of the strong, and only the strong ones could survive.</p> <p>Therefore, when one was holding a precious zombie nucleus which could buy a large pile of food, it would be normal for the others to cast their eyes on them.</p> <p>Robberies and murders happened quite often between zombie-hunting squads. Every squad which came out of the base to hunt zombies needed to watch out for the other zombie-hunting squads that might sneakily attack them.</p> <p>Between zombie-hunting squads, people might not really kill each other cruelly. As long as the one with the zombie nucleus was willing to surrender the treasure, the other squad might still let them live.</p> <p>However, if a zombie-hunting squad was robbed by an army from a base, the squad would be destroyed, and all its members would die for sure. The reason was obvious.</p> <p>More importantly, half of the leaders of Hades Base had been replaced, and now was a chaotic period in the base. Fishing in troubled water had always been what human beings were best at.</p> <p>Hearing him, Long Qingying shook her head and said, “Stop fooling yourself. The body of that level-four zombie is lying out there. Once they find it, what will they think?”</p> <p>“That we’re the only squad here, so it can only be us who killed the level-four zombie…” Du Yuanxing sighed.</p> <p>The others all wore a grim look, showing a trace of despair and ferocity. However, they soon accepted the situation, as they understood that they came out of the base to risk their lives for a better life, and that zombies weren’t the only dangerous beings out here.</p> <p>At the moment, the fighting capacity of this squad hadn’t recovered fully, as two team members were still in a coma. So, they needed to spare two men to look after them.</p> <p>“They haven’t started attacking yet, so we should pull out first. Perhaps, we still have a chance to run,” said Long Qingying.</p> <p>“Let’s move then!” Du Yuanxing didn’t want to waste any time.</p> <p>Once he said the words, the others immediately turned and prepared to go. They asked two relatively stronger teammates to carry the unconscious two. Du Yuanxing and Cai Hongqing raised their guns which were carried on their backs, both showing serious and alert expressions.</p> <p>Long Qingying had her katana gripped in her hands the whole time. Lin Qiao didn’t leave her weapon in the place which was covered in piles of zombie bodies.</p> <p>For that reason, she felt slightly grateful toward the latter. Although she was still keeping a vigilance against the latter, her view of the zombie had changed a little.</p> <p>When the team began moving, Long Qingying walked to the door with the katana, then gently opened it and alertly looked outside. After discovering no danger, she walked out ahead of the others.</p> <p>She held the katana behind her body with one hand, and had the other hand raised, palm facing forward. Soon, some metal objects flew out of the room and melted into a metal ball in front of her. Before long, the metal ball transformed into a series of steel thorns, floating in the air. As Long Qingying moved forward, the metal thorns drifted forward along with her.</p> <p>Behind her were Cai Hongqing and the two who were carrying their unconscious teammates. Du Yuanxing was following in the rear, keeping a sharp lookout.</p> <p>None of them had noticed that an invisible figure had been quietly following them, but was keeping a distance from them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had guessed their situation earlier when she heard their conversations. As this squad now seemed to be on guard for all possible dangers, Lin Qiao understood that those newcomers weren’t good people. She estimated that a battle would soon start. However, judging by what Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying said, there was a big difference in strength between them and the enemies.</p> <p>They didn’t seem to have a chance to win.</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently walked past them, then directly leaped out of a window nearby. After that, she leaped to the ground from the third floor. After a smooth landing, she was surer that her body was much nimbler than before.</p> <p>When leaping down, she didn’t have the scary sense of weightlessness anymore. Instead, she could even adjust her position in the air.</p> <p>She felt that her body was becoming more and more agile, and that made her happier and happier.</p> <p>After landing, while waiting for Long Qingying and her teammates to come down, she sneakily moved toward the people who were hiding in all kinds of corners about twenty meters away.</p> <p>She didn’t sense any superpower energy from these people, meaning that they were all just ordinary human beings who probably had good combat skills. These people weren’t hiding in random places. Instead, they were not far away from each other, so each one of them was all able to observe the situation of the surrounding teammates, who were in the range of each other’s weapons.</p> <p>In this way, they were able to shoot the zombies behind their surrounding teammates, and wouldn’t need to worry about zombies attacking from their backs.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quickly walked around among these people, then figured out their formation and its functions.</p> <p>She didn’t linger or do anything to these people, but moved toward the group of people behind, who had been emitting stronger scents of human beings. She wasn’t worried about the scout team, as the members of this scout team were all without superpowers. This scouting team had no choice but to stay put at the moment, because if they attacked, Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing, who were with level-five superpowers, would utterly destroy them.</p> <p>From what Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing said, Lin Qiao had learned that the ones who had been threatening them were the main force of this army, who were further behind.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to know how powerful that so-called main force was, and why could he or she even make Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing feel frightened and despairing.</p> <p>She crossed a few streets and moved for less than three-hundred meters before having her eyes on the target.</p> <p>She found two heavily armored military vehicles parked in the middle of a square. Both vehicles were wrapped in steel frames and iron sheets, which made them bulletproof. The claws of ordinary zombies couldn’t possibly leave a scratch on these iron sheets.</p> <p>Both vehicles were quite large, each able contain twenty to thirty people.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed that not many people were in this area, only about forty of them. However, the superpowered ones in the vehicles were rather strong. One of them even made Lin Qiao feel a slight pressure. Judging by the vibe, Lin Qiao felt that this person was a level-six superpowered one.</p> <p>What was this deputy-chief-level superpowered person here for?</p> <p>Only to hunt Long Qingying? Did Long Qingying need to be handled by a level-six just because she had helped Lin Wenwen and her family?</p>",
  "Chapter 112: Eavesdrop On The Enemy": "<p>While thinking about the purpose of this level-six powerful being, Lin Qiao continued approaching the two vehicles. She didn’t get too close, but stopped about ten meters away to quietly observe the area surrounding the vehicles.</p> <p>Through observation, she discovered that the surrounding zombies had been following the human scents emitting from the vehicles and slowly gathering toward this area.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sniffed at the air and found that the human scent in this area wasn’t really strong, but was actually quite faint, as a large part of it had probably been blocked by the vehicles.</p> <p>The zombies nearby were able to sense the human scents from the vehicles, but the ones who were further away couldn’t sense it at all. Therefore, all the surrounding zombies had wandered to this area by chance before detecting the scents of human beings and coming at the two vehicles. However, the shooters in the vehicles would blow their heads up before they could approach.</p> <p>The zombies from further areas were attracted by guns. Not a large number of zombies had gathered in this area, as all the zombies were moving over very slowly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw that the dead bodies of quite a few zombies lying in a circle around the two vehicles, about ten meters away. That was why she didn’t approach the car immediately.</p> <p>Both of the two vehicles were covered in all sorts of equipment. Lin Qiao guessed that more than one detectors were installed on each vehicle, added with some highly dangerous weapons. She believed that these vehicles were designed for defending against not only zombies, but also human beings.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t tell if she would be detected by their detectors.</p> <p>As for the level-six superpowered being, she believed that that person wouldn’t be able to detect her. After all, she managed to run away from under the eyes of Wu Yueling’s dad last time, who was a level-seven one.</p> <p>She began moving forward meter by meter, trying to approach the two vehicles. As she got closer, she didn’t hear any alarm going off. When she was less than two meters away, the people in the two vehicles still made no reaction.</p> <p>Only after that did Lin Qiao walk up to one of the two vehicles without concern, and reached out a hand to touch it. However, she then took her hand back, as she didn’t know if the vehicle had any sensors, or if she would trigger any alarm by touching the car. But then, she realized that she was in the invisible state, and even the detectors had failed to detect her. Therefore, she believed that even if she did touch a sensor, she would need to worry nothing.</p> <p>Those people couldn’t see her anyway!</p> <p>With that thought, she gently gripped the bumper of the car. As no alarm was triggered, she climbed up on all fours and easily hopped onto the car roof.</p> <p>The car was armed from the wheels to the roof, surrounded in a thick steel frame which was covered in iron thorns, designed to prevent zombie attacks.</p> <p>After nimbly climbing onto the car roof, Lin Qiao finally found a flat spot to lie down on.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s body was light, and her movements were gentle. So, when she was moving on the car roof, the people inside felt nothing.</p> <p>She found an air hole on the car roof, then pressed her ear on it to hear the sounds in the car.</p> <p>The sounds coming from the car weren’t loud, as they were blocked by something. However, Lin Qiao’s sense of hearing was as good as her sense of smell. Therefore, not to mention the sounds in the car, she could even hear the sounds from under the car.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the people in the car weren’t talking, but were very quiet. If she didn’t hear the sounds of breathing and some machines, she would have thought that the car was empty.</p> <p>Since no one was talking, this car wasn’t the one with the command control dial panel. Normally, the commanders would stay in the car with the command control dial panel.</p> <p>Lin Qiao waited for a while, but failed to hear anything. So, she stood up and directly leaped to the other car, which was less than two meters away. Then, she nimbly landed on the roof of that car and lied down again to try hearing the sounds inside.</p> <p>“They’re in the hotel building over there? Are you sure?” She heard a voice from the car. It seemed that this commander was trying to confirm something with his subordinates.</p> <p>“Em… Since you’ve confirmed their location, keep an eye on them. We’re on our way…What? Level-four spirit-powered? Why didn’t you report about it just now?… Alright, I get it. Did you see a wind-powered one?…No?…Alright! Keep an eye on them, but don’t alert them.”</p> <p>The man ended the conversation soon, then turned to the man beside him and said, “Start the car…Let’s go!”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” The man in the driver’s seat responded. Right after that, the car began moving slowly toward the hotel building.</p> <p>Then, the commander said to the driver, “They said that they’ve located them. Du Yuanxing and his team are hiding in the hotel building, about three-hundred meters in the front.”</p> <p>“Hotel?” Another voice spoke up, “Ah, I remember that place! Captain Hua, just now you mentioned level-four spirit-powered…What is it? Zombie?”</p> <p>Huo Wu was the name of the commander who was called Captain Huo. “En…The scouting team said that they’ve found the body of a level-four spirit-powered zombie, which was killed not long ago. It should be Du Yuanxing and his people.” He replied.</p> <p>“Then… did you find the wind-powered zombie’s body?” Asked the second soldier. “Have they killed the wind-powered one too?”</p> <p>Huo Wu shook his head and said, “I asked, and they said no. They’ve only found a spirit-powered one. Yang Cheng, be patient. The wind-powered zombie should have run away if it weren’t killed by them. Or perhaps, it’s still nearby. It won’t be too late for us to find that wind-powered zombie after we have dealt with Du Yuanxing and his people.”</p> <p>Yang Cheng had no choice but to respond smilingly, “You’re right, you’re right! Let’s do what you said, Captain. We should kill that woman first. But, why do we have to kill her? I know that she used to be close with Lin Wenwen, but Lin Feng and his people are like homeless dogs now. We don’t even know if they can escape Chief Yang. Are we worrying that this woman might join them someday?”</p> <p>“What do you know?” Said Huo Wu scornfully, “Do you know what is Long Qingying’s power?”</p> <p>“I do. Isn’t it metal power?” Yang Cheng asked.</p> <p>“Yeah, metal power it is. Do you know how destructive her power is? She’s able to control all the metal objects in the area a hundred meters around the street, and destroy the entire street within five seconds. So, what will happen when she gets to level-five or even level-seven? Do you think she’ll try to take revenge for Lin Wenwen or not? And, if Lin Wenwen and her family survived Yang Jianhua, they might find her after that, and will definitely return after they have grown stronger. By then, how great do you think Long Qingying’s metal power will have become?” Huo Wu said.</p> <p>Yang Cheng thought for a moment. He pictured Long Qingying controlling all the metal objects in the base and turning them into her weapons. That was such a scary scene that he didn’t even dare to continue imagining it.</p>",
  "Chapter 113: Cut Off the Detectors": "<p>It was really hard for superpowered human beings to upgrade after level-five. A large number of lower level zombie nuclei wouldn’t be able to allow a level-five superpowered human to break into level-six. Instead, this person needed to grow his or her energy with higher-level zombie nuclei. The zombie nuclei which contained the same kind of power as the person would deliver a better effect.</p> <p>For example, Yang Cheng had wind power, and was currently at the peak of level-four. He was only a breath away from level five, but he couldn’t find enough energy to help him achieve a breakthrough.</p> <p>Therefore, he now planned to kill Du Yuanxing and his teammates for the nucleus of the level-four wind-powered zombie. With that wind-powered zombie nucleus, he would be able to step into level-five and become a captain himself. After that, what would he need Du Yuanxing for?</p> <p>“But, it’s extremely difficult to upgrade after level-five. Can Long Qingying truly reach level-six or seven? I doubt it!” Yang Cheng remarked.</p> <p>“Cut the weeds and dig up the roots, don’t you understand that? Long Qingying isn’t the only one to worry about. We need to erase all the groups that are close with Netherworld Fire and her family. But, that is none of your concern. All you need to do is collect as much information about those people as possible,” Huo Wu glanced at him and said.</p> <p>Yang Cheng, who had been warned slightly, felt that he had talked too much. So, he immediately gave a smile and said, “Yes, yes, yes, I understand! I’ll tell you everything I find out about the people who’re still in contact with Chief Netherworld Fire’s family, or used to be her loyal followers.”</p> <p>“Follow your Chief Yang, and you’ll have everything you need. That is the right path to take. If your old Chief Netherworld fire chose to work with us, wouldn’t everyone have had a better life? However, she rejected us, and suffered the consequences,” said Huo Wu.</p> <p>Yang Cheng’s face began turning dark, but he still forced a smile while nodding and responding with, “You’re right, you’re right!”</p> <p>However, in his heart, he was cursing silently, ‘Damn you! Work together? You really made that sound nice! You wanted to merge our base, didn’t you? Do you think that our Chief was stupid? If she agreed to work with you, our base would have become yours! If I was not so weak, I’d never bow before you!’</p> <p>While listening to their conversation, Lin Qiao was also paying attention to the direction that the car was moving in.</p> <p>She felt a little strange about the changes of emotions of the man named Yang Cheng. He was holding negative thoughts, but still, he was wearing a smiling face and trying quite hard to fawn on the level-six one.</p> <p>As Yang Cheng seemed to care about the wind-powered zombie nucleus, Lin Qiao guessed that he was the traitor that Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing had mentioned before.</p> <p>She also felt that the level-six one’s words did make sense to the people on his side. If they let Long Qingying live and continue growing stronger, she would become a huge trouble for them one day.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao thought that maybe she should bring Long Qingying with her while leaving. As long as the latter believed that she wouldn’t hurt her own family, she would be able to ask her any question.</p> <p>With that thought, Lin Qiao took a turn on top of this heavily armored car, then directly showed her face.</p> <p>The moment she showed up, all the alarms in the two cars went off.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ignored the alarms, popped out her claws, and began swiftly cutting all kinds of detectors and sensors on the car.</p> <p>Following a series of noises, the people in the car began shouting.</p> <p>“What is with the alarms?”</p> <p>“Great Captain… According to the alarms, there’s a zombie nearby. A high-level one, level-four or above. And, it’s very close!”</p> <p>“Great Captain! The fifteen-meter virus detector is broken, so is the ten-meter detector…and…”</p> <p>“Great Captain! The head source detector is broken!”</p> <p>“Great Captain…”</p> <p>Hearing the reports made by his soldiers who were sitting before the control panel, Huo Wu yelled impatiently, “Alright, I know! Didn’t you hear the noise on the car roof? You’ve let a high-level zombie hop onto our car, so I wonder what you needed those detectors for.”</p> <p>None of the soldiers in the car dared to many any sound.</p> <p>At that moment, the communicator rang, then the scouting team leader’s voice was heard. “Captain, I think they found us. They’re leaving, heading to the East.”</p> <p>“I’m on my way,” Huo Wu picked up the communicator and said.</p> <p>After that, he threw away the communicator and turned around, “Open the door, I’m getting out. Tell the combat team to move.”</p> <p>“Yes, Sir!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao leaped down the car roof after breaking all the detectors and sensors. In midair, she directly switched to the invisible state.</p> <p>Once she turned herself invisible, she saw the car door open. Then, an about thirty-five years old, average-looking man jumped out of the car, wearing army-green shirt and pants.</p> <p>He conveniently threw out a dark-red stream of fire, which roared toward the surrounding zombies like a fire dragon. As the fire dragon swept across the air, those zombies were sent up flying all over the sky.</p> <p>The fire burned the zombies out at an incredibly high speed. Right in midair, many zombies were burned into ashes which then drifted away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was standing on a tree nearby. She sensed the fire, which made her feel very uncomfortable. She couldn’t feel temperatures, but still, the bad feeling attacked her in her mouth, nose, and brain.</p> <p>So, she drew back immediately. Next, she saw that man move his feet and dart out fleetingly like a shred of shadow.</p> <p>She had found that all strong superpowered human beings were able to move swiftly. Even the ones who didn’t have wind power were able to run as fast as the wind.</p> <p>After the man left, the doors of the other car were opened as well. A squad of soldiers who were armed to the teeth rushed out with guns, then began moving in the same direction as the man at an impressive speed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her running speed to follow behind the man in army green closely. She guessed that he was the so-called ‘Great Captain’.</p> <p>At that moment, Du Yuanxing and his teammates had hopped onto the car which was left in front of the hotel building by Lin Qiao, and were driving toward another street. Long Qingying was still standing on the car roof, with one hand raised. Tens of steel thorns were floating before her palm.</p> <p>Once the zombies which followed behind the car got a little closer, the steel thorns before her hand would dart out to stop them; when the human enemies hiding in surrounding buildings showed their faces, Long Qingying’s attack would also land on them immediately.</p> <p>Her steel thorns would pierce into the enemies’ vital body parts accurately and mercilessly.</p> <p>Not long after they started driving, the temperature around the car was raised suddenly.</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>A giant fire dragon suddenly rose from the roadside, pouncing straight on Du Yuanxing’s car.</p>",
  "Chapter 114: The Traitor By Their Side": "<p>“It’s Huo Wu! Huo Wu from the Earth Dragon Base!” Cai Hong Qing shouted while turning the steering wheel. The car turned quickly and dodged the fire dragon’s attack.</p> <p>The fire dragon missed its target; but soon, it rose again, turning and continuing to dive down toward the car.</p> <p>Squeak!</p> <p>Before Cai Hongqing could drive the car away, he was forced to turn away by the fire dragon and nearly bumped into a wall.</p> <p>Once the car was stopped, the fire dragon stopped diving, only hovering in the air.</p> <p>“None of you are going to leave here today. Just surrender Long Qingying and the level-four spirit-powered zombie’s nucleus. If you do as I say, I’ll give you a quick death.” A man’s voice was heard.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing rushed out of the car to shield the car behind. Long Qingying leaped off the car roof, then walked to his side. While staring at the talking man, she had also been killing the surrounding zombies with steel thorns.</p> <p>“Huo Wu, you’re a scum from Earth Dragon Base. Sooner or later, Lin Feng will kill you. Do you think you can unite the nation by joining hands with the other two bases and attacking our Hades Base? Stop dreaming! Your Chief is a p*ssy! He sold his a*s to the men from Sky Fire Base and Hidden Cloud Base so that they’d agree to help him.” Du Yuanxing stared at Huo Wu who showed up suddenly, sneering while showing no fear toward the latter’s fire dragon.</p> <p>Huo Wu sneered at him too, then snorted and said, “If your Deputy Chief didn’t betray you, our Chief wouldn’t have succeeded. Your problem was started by your own people, and we simply helped.”</p> <p>He didn’t try contradicting Du Yuanxing’s words, but mentioned another thing. What Du Yuanxing said wasn’t entirely wrong. The leader of the Earth Dragon Base was named Long Yubai. He was a beautiful and girly man, yet he possessed the precious water power.</p> <p>The people with water power were considered as the precious water sources in the post-apocalyptic world, so the others would protect them. The leaders from the Sky Fire Base and Hidden Cloud Base all fancied Long Yubai’s water power, as well as his face and body, very much.</p> <p>Few women existed in the post-apocalyptic world. Therefore, more male homosexuals emerged after the apocalypse.</p> <p>The two Southern bases were each led by one leader. Long Yubai was planning to build a large base together with Netherworld Fire, but the latter refused to work with him. Netherworld Fire was a powerful being. Even though building and maintaining a base for millions of people was a little difficult for her, she was certainly able to build a base which could contain hundreds of thousands of people.</p> <p>Therefore, the Hades Base was built by Netherworld Fire herself and her followers, while the Earth Dragon Base was built by the powerful people from other bases. Only with the help of the powerful survivors from the bases in Southwest China could Long Yubai build the Earth Dragon Base.</p> <p>However, during the past few years, Long Yubai never stopped casting his greedy eyes on the Hades Base, which wasn’t far away from him. So this time, he allied with two other bases and Yang Jianhua, who was the Deputy Chief of Hades Base, and murdered the leader of Hades Base.</p> <p>Chief Netherworld Fire was betrayed and poisoned by the one she trusted the most. Some important information about her was leaked, and by the time she realized what was happening, the enemy’s troops had arrived.</p> <p>At last, she fought as hard as she could to draw the few most powerful enemies away, then burned half of her base with her power. Only after making such a great effort did she manage to send her family away.</p> <p>She herself went to a cliff by the sea with five level-seven superpowered ones from the enemy’s side.</p> <p>As for the result of the final battle, no one knew about it for sure. People only knew that that cliff had become a forbidden area not long ago, occupied by poisonous fire. It was said that only four of the five level-seven superpowered beings had returned.</p> <p>Hearing Huo Wu say that it was all because one of their own people, Du Yuanxing clenched his teeth with anger. He believed that he would vomit blood in wrath if he was betrayed by his most trusted friend.</p> <p>Even though he wasn’t the Chief, he still felt like vomiting blood. His Deputy Chief had sold the base, meaning that that man had betrayed everyone from the Hades Base.</p> <p>And, that evil man was now going after Chief’s families, coveting Chief’s sister.</p> <p>He felt that even the words like ‘brutal’ or ‘cold-blooded’ weren’t enough to describe that man; he believed that that man had lost his humanity!</p> <p>“How long do you think that inhumane scum named Yang Jianhua can live? That kind of ungrateful man will be killed sooner or later. So, we can’t die before we have seen his end!” Du Yuanxing clenched his teeth and widened his eyes while yelling. His voice was filled with hatred and anger.</p> <p>The others were also showing an angry look. Long Qingying’s face had already been occupied by an intention of killing. However, her murderous intention wasn’t targeting at Huo Wu, but at Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>She didn’t say anything, but coldly looked at Huo Wu.</p> <p>Huo Wu ignored Du Yuanxing, but turned to look at Long Qingying from head to toe. After that, he said, “Since you’re a woman, why don’t you come back with me? Come to my base. I’ll talk to my Chief and ask him to spare your life. Be my woman, so you can survive.”</p> <p>While speaking, he stared at Long Qingying with his eyes glowing.</p> <p>Long Qingying was average-looking, but her face was nicely shaped, and her skin was smooth and clean. She had this cool vibe, and her long ponytail was swinging behind her hip. She looked cold, but also pretty and dashing. She had an indescribable unique quality that was enough to make men’s hearts itch.</p> <p>Many men had the strong desire to pin strong-minded women like her down and torture them violently.</p> <p>Thinking of Long Qingying’s white and soft body, long and slender limbs, and her painful but restrained expressions, Huo Wu felt that his blood was even boiling.</p> <p>However, facing the greediness which had been growing more and more obvious in Huo Wu’s eyes, Long Qingying seemed to feel nothing at all.</p> <p>“Chop your own head off, then I’ll consider letting you kiss my toe.” She said coldly. Having finished talking, she showed a faint scornfulness in her eyes when looking at Huo Wu, as if the latter was just a dog.</p> <p>“You ungrateful b*tch!” Huo Wu wore a vicious look while staring at Long Qingying and saying, “You’ve turned down my kindness, so you’ll be punished now. If you want to end up in the same way as your Chief did, I’ll fulfill your wish.”</p> <p>After saying that, he suddenly raised both arms and made a swing.</p> <p>The fire dragon immediately dove down toward Long Qingying, the ferocious dragon head bringing a scorching hot wave of air with it. Long Qingying and all the others automatically moved sideways and dodged Huo Wu’s attack.</p> <p>Seeing them dodge, Huo Wu didn’t move his feet but swung his arm again. Following his move, the fire dragon charged straight at Long Qingying again. It widely opened its mouth, ready to swallow her up.</p> <p>Long Qingying, Du Yuanxing, and their teammates didn’t show any sign of weakness, but rushed up toughly, maybe because they knew that they had no chance of survival this time.</p> <p>They knew that they were going to die, but they wanted to die with dignity. They wanted their death to cost the scum from the Earth Dragon Base an arm or a leg at least!</p>",
  "Chapter 115: The Battle": "<p>As the fire dragon dove down, Long Qingying raised both her hands and pushed forward. Following her moves, all the metal objects a hundred meters around her flew toward her from all direction, quickly forming a web and shielding Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>The fire dragon swished down along with a scorching hot gust of wind, lunging toward Long Qingying’s metal web.</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>A muffled noise was heard as the fire dragon was temporarily stopped by the metal web. However, Long Qingying moaned in pain with a muffled voice as she felt a great pressure, even bending her legs slightly.</p> <p>But soon, she stood straight again against the pressure given by the fire dragon. Her face paled a little, with her teeth clenched. A few drops of blood were squeezed out of her mouth corner.</p> <p>“You’re pretty strong. I’d like to know how long you can last,” Huo Wu sneered and waved his hand. The fire dragon rose into the sky again, then flipped in the air and made another dive fiercely toward Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>While diving down, the fire dragon’s fire had been gathering toward its head from its body. As a result, the dragon head instantly turned huge.</p> <p>The roar uttered from the widely opened dragon mouth sounded like a fiery hurricane.</p> <p>“No! You can’t hold it off! Move!” The look in Du Yuanxing’s face changed as he saw the suddenly expanded dragon head. While shouting, he rushed at Long Qingying, brought her down, and immediately rolled to the side together with her.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Right after that, the fire dragon’s head smashed into the spot where Long Qingying stood just now. Along with the thunderous sound, her metal web shattered completely.</p> <p>Following a series of clanks and clangs, a giant number of metal objects fell to the ground.</p> <p>The fire dragon didn’t disappear after destroying the metal web, but coiled its body on the ground, then sprung back up and again and became an enormous fire dragon head.</p> <p>After rolling to the side, both Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying leaped up from the ground immediately and raised their arms.</p> <p>The metal objects which had fallen to the ground gathered toward Long Qingying once again, then soon turned into countless sharp arrows. As she swung her arms, over a hundred arrows shot at Huo Wu.</p> <p>Huo Wu reacted fast by waving a hand. The fire dragon leaped before his body, opened its mouth wide, and swallowed all the metal arrows. A few seconds later, it opened its mouth again and spat something out.</p> <p>Those were Long Qingying’s metal arrows, except all being molten.</p> <p>At the same time, Du Yuanxing, who stood by her side, waved his arms as well. An arm-thick electric current was released from his palms, sizzling toward Huo Wu like an electric snake.</p> <p>The distance between him and Huo Wu was merely about twenty meters. The electric snake directly extended to twenty meters long; its head flashed toward Huo Wu while its tail was still held in Du Yuanxing’s hands.</p> <p>The electric snake moved so swiftly that before the fire dragon swallowed Long Qingying’s arrows, it had already reached Huo Wu’s feet and opened its jaws to bite.</p> <p>Huo Wu waved his hand at that moment, after which, the fire dragon before him split into two, one of them directly biting at Du Yuanxing’s electric snake.</p> <p>Puff! Bang!</p> <p>Following an explosive sound, Du Yuanxing’s electric snake was dissipated.</p> <p>At that point, the people from both sides had shown their powers. Huo Wu’s fire dragon was gigantic, swift, and powerful. Moreover, he was able to control two fire dragons to attack at the same time.</p> <p>Long Qingying’s movements had a large range, but weren’t powerful enough. It was easy for her to deal with zombies, but when facing the level-six Huo Wu, things had become a little difficult.</p> <p>Huo Wu’s fire dragon had swallowed Long Qingying’s metal arrows and chewed Du Yuanxing’s electric snake, meaning that he was able to invalidate both of their attacks. Nevertheless, the two weren’t able to destroy his fire dragon.</p> <p>That was the difference between their powers.</p> <p>Furthermore, Huo Wu hadn’t even launched his most potent attack yet.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>At that moment, a series of gunshots were heard.</p> <p>Huo Wu swung his arm sideways. Following his move, the second fire snake hovered around his body to defend him against the bullets flying at him. He turned his head to find that Cai Hongqing and the others had moved behind and shot at him from the back.</p> <p>Can Hongqing was only at level-four, and he had just stepped into that level not long ago. His green power couldn’t be used for launching effective attacks. Only in places like parks or woods was he able to attack with his power. However, as he didn’t have a good control over his power, his superpower attack could hardly harm strong enemies.</p> <p>Therefore, he preferred to attack with guns directly!</p> <p>He wasn’t trying to do any harm to the six-level Luowu. Instead, he just wanted to distract him.</p> <p>As Huo Wu turned his head, Long Qingying instantly gritted her teeth and raised her arms toward the surrounding metal objects. Her arms attracted all the metal pieces again like two magnets. Then, she turned the metal pieces into a metal ball and threw it up, sending it toward Huo Wu.</p> <p>The metal ball had a radius of only a meter and two inches, but it was extremely heavy, about two-hundred kilograms. As it was thrown down from high up in the air, it became several times more powerful than it should be.</p> <p>The metal ball fell down toward Huo Wu quickly. When he turned back to look at Cai Hongqing and the others, he was going to swing an arm to control a fire dragon and swallow them. But, before he could do that, he sensed the large metal ball which was thrown at him by Long Qingying.</p> <p>Therefore, he immediately gave up on attacking Cai Hongqing and his teammates who were running away, but turned back to raise both arms high.</p> <p>In the next moment, a fire dragon shrank and flashed across the air, appearing above his head within a blink. Then, it expanded again and opened its mouth to swallow the falling metal ball.</p> <p>Under Huo Wu’s control, the fire dragon suddenly turned toward Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing. On its way, it opened its mouth again and spat the metal ball back out, making it fly at the two.</p> <p>Looking at the metal ball which was flying swiftly at herself, Long Qingying paused in shock. When she realized what was happening, she found that her body was no longer under her control.</p> <p>Just now, she had consumed a large amount of energy to create the metal ball and make it fly in the air. So, she was exhausted at the moment, and the exhaustion directly affected her physical coordination.</p> <p>Therefore, she couldn’t even make a roll to dodge the metal ball this time</p> <p>“It’s dangerous! Run!” Du Yuanxing had sensed that Long Qingying was in danger back when the fire dragon spat the metal ball out. However, he was a little far away from her at the moment, and it was already too late for him to try saving her.</p> <p>He only managed to utter a growl while watching the metal ball falling toward her head.</p>",
  "Chapter 116: The Dangerous Moment": "<p>At the moment, Huo Wu was confidently waiting to watch Long Qingying be smashed by her own metal ball, his face wearing a look of pity.</p> <p>He did feel pity as he wouldn’t get a chance to sleep with this special woman.</p> <p>But right at that moment, an invisible figure flashed by Long Qingying’s side, grabbing her before the metal ball fell. In the next instant, Long Qingying disappeared.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Along with a thunderous sound, the heavy metal ball landed on the ground, shaking the area. It sank half-way into the ground and left a few cracks in the concrete floor around the hole it created.</p> <p>Huo Wu didn’t see any blood splash or Long Qingying’s smashed body. He didn’t even see a drop of blood.</p> <p>He stared at the metal ball for a while with surprise. After confirming that there was truly no blood, he walked toward it.</p> <p>Why wasn’t there any splashing blood? Even if the blood didn’t splash, it would spray to the ground, wouldn’t it? And, the metal ball wasn’t large enough to sink an adult entirely into the ground. Even if Long Qingying’s body was buried under the metal ball, where were her head and limbs?</p> <p>Du Yuanxing was also staring at the metal ball which had sunk half-way into the ground with confusion. He had as many questions as Huo Wu did.</p> <p>But soon, he came back to his senses. He understood that he should try saving himself first Instead of worrying about Long Qingying! He believed that the survival of himself would be better than the destruction of the whole team.</p> <p>Earlier on, he wanted to risk his own life to fight, but now, he was thoroughly frightened. After a few attacks, he found that Huo Wu had been suppressing him and Long Qingying firmly, and they had no chance of winning at all.</p> <p>Now, as Huo Wu was paying attention to Long Qingying, who could be dead or alive, Du Yuanxing had a chance to run.</p> <p>Therefore, he hesitated shortly, then immediately turned to leave.</p> <p>Huo Wu was planning to walk to the metal ball to check if Long Qingying has died, but Du Yuanxing’s move caught his eyes instantly. He turned to find the running Du Yuanxing, then sneered.</p> <p>“Do you wanna run? Do you think you can run? None of you can run!”</p> <p>While speaking, the fire dragons which were hovering above his head immediately moved in two different directions, one pouncing on Du Yuanxing while the other one flying at Cai Hongqing and the others who had already ran far away.</p> <p>The armored warriors who came from another side saw Huo Wu’s flying fire dragons.</p> <p>“Over there! Follow up!”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Yang Cheng sneakily moved toward Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Huo Wu turned his body to face Du Yuanxing, then abruptly swung his arms toward the fire dragon in the sky.</p> <p>The fire dragon suddenly shrank into a fireball, then expanded again within a blink to form a giant cover as it descended onto Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing didn’t manage to run far before Huo Wu’s fire cover fell on him.</p> <p>The temperature suddenly became scorching hot. He felt that his hair and eyebrows were even starting to burn, as if he had fallen into a giant oven.</p> <p>Before he could even think, the fire cover began shrinking.</p> <p>When he saw the quickly shrinking fire cover, his brain finally started producing thoughts.</p> <p>‘I’m dead! I’m gonna be charred this time!’</p> <p>In the next second, what he had been thinking almost happened for real, as the shrunken fire cover directly coiled on his body.</p> <p>“Ah!” He immediately began screaming and rolling on the ground. A series of sizzling noises could be heard, as electric sparks emerged from the fire wrapping around his body, trying to stop the fire from hurting him.</p> <p>However, the electric sparks could barely deliver any effect in the fire. Before long, his entire body was set on fire.</p> <p>“Ah! Huo Wu! Sooner or… later… you’ll… end up the same… as us! Ah!!!”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing rolled on the ground while cursing Huo Wu in pain, thinking that he would be dead soon. This time, he really didn’t have a chance of survival.</p> <p>Right at that moment, he felt that someone had grabbed his shoulder which was suffering the burning pain. Before he realized anything, he felt that he had suddenly fallen into the water. His entire body had sunken into the water, which surged into his ears and mouth, stopping him from breathing.</p> <p>He felt that the water was deep, as he was still sinking.</p> <p>Then, he realized something in a burst of happiness. The first word emerged in his head was ‘water’. The water could save him!</p> <p>After that, he calmed himself down and looked around. He found that the fire on his body was gone, and his whole body was in the water, sinking.</p> <p>He immediately came back to his senses. His clothes rubbed against his burning wounds and caused him pain, but he ignored it while swimming toward the water surface with all fours.</p> <p>When stuck his head out of the water and clearly saw the surrounding environment, he yelled out with surprise, “You… Why are you here?”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Out of Lin Qiao’s space, Huo Wu was stunned. He gazed at where Du Yuanxing disappeared, then turned back to look at the metal ball which was supposed to land on Long Qingying. He found nothing around the metal ball. No broken limbs, no blood.</p> <p>Before he could figure out what happened with Long Qingying, Du Yuanxing vanished right before his face!</p> <p>Vanished!</p> <p>How on earth could a human being just vanish into thin air!</p> <p>Huo Wu rushed to where Du Yuanxing disappeared and found that not only had Du Yuanxing had vanished, but the fire which was supposed to burn him to death was gone as well. He couldn’t sense the fire anymore.</p> <p><em>‘What happened? How did that happen?’</em></p> <p>When Huo Wu was trying to figure something on the outside, Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying, who were dragged into Lin Qiao’s space, had been standing by the lakeside, looking at this space in shock.</p> <p>The sky was misty, with no sun or clouds.</p> <p>Where was the bright sunlight?</p> <p>Du Yuanxing saw a dark-green lake, a grassland, some furniture pieces placed randomly on the grass, and some daily supplies for human beings.</p> <p>Then, he saw the zombie who stole his sunglasses! He felt that his brain wasn’t working so well at the moment… No, in fact, he felt that his brain wasn’t working at all!</p> <p><em>‘What’s going on? Where is this place? Why did I get here? Did this zombie save us again? What is this place? Why am I here within a blink? What is the lake? And the furniture? Eh? Is that a kid over there?’ </em></p> <p>All sorts of puzzles emerged in his mind, making him feel that his head was exploding. Only after he saw Junjun and the little boy by the entrance of the small space did he finally realize something.</p> <p>“This… this place is…?” He turned to Long Qingying and asked.</p>",
  "Chapter 117: Inexplicable Disappearance": "<p>Long Qingying looked at him coldly, then turned to Lin Qiao. She didn’t say a word, but directly thrust a piece of paper into Du Yuanxing’s hands.</p> <p>It wasn’t because she didn’t want to answer his question, but because she honestly didn’t know how.</p> <p>Just now, when she thought that she’d be smashed to death by the iron ball when she suddenly felt that her arm was dragged and eyes were dazzled. After that, she was standing by the lakeside.</p> <p>Before she could react, the zombie standing beside her took out the notepad, quickly wrote a few words, and put the note into his hands, then vanished right before her eyes.</p> <p>She was stunned for a while before coming back to her senses. Then, she finally realized that she was still alive. Before she read the note, she heard a flop. As she raised her head to see what happened, she saw the zombie again show up again. It seemed that the zombie had thrown something into the lake and caused a loud noise, rippling the lake surface intensively.</p> <p>After that, she saw a man struggling onto the water surface. After looking closer, she found that the man was none other than Du Yuanxing, who was fighting side by side with her just now!</p> <p>Seeing the look of confusion and relief in Du Yuanxing’s face, she figured that he must have experienced the same kind of situation as she did, and been brought to this place by the zombie.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood by the lakeside and closed her eyes to observe the outside situation. She found that it was already too late for her to go out and save the other people.</p> <p>She tried asking Qiu Lili to help to save those people, but the latter was bearing a grudge against human beings. She had convinced herself not to hurt human beings, but wasn’t willing to save any human being. Therefore, she directly disappeared when Lin Qiao asked for her help.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t make Qiu Lili save those people; she didn’t have the capability even if she wanted to.</p> <p>Therefore, she only saved the two who were relatively nearer to her. At the moment, the rest of Du Yuanxing’s team members were either killed by Huo Wu’s people with guns or burned to death by Huo Wu’s other fire dragon.</p> <p>She glanced at Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing, who still didn’t know what had happened.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing unwrapped the paper given by Long Qingying, and read the note—Stay put!</p> <p><em>‘Stay here? Does she want me to stay here and not move?’</em></p> <p>Du Yuanxing didn’t understand what the note meant. He looked at Long Qingying with confusion, then at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>He didn’t know that the note was written for Long Qingying by Lin Qiao. Long Qingying hadn’t read it yet. When Du Yuanxing asked her what happened, she automatically handed the note to him, as she herself didn’t know what happened either.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them, then took out the pen to write another note—’I<em>couldn’t help your other teammates.’</em></p> <p>Finishing writing, she wadded the paper up and handed it to Long Qingying.</p> <p>After reading the note, Long Qingying showed a sad look in her eyes and passed it on to Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing glanced at the note, then had his face darkened. The atmosphere turned bleak and mournful.</p> <p>He was sad, but soon accepted the death of his teammates. It wasn’t the first time for him to lose teammates, and of course, wouldn’t be the last time either.</p> <p>Zombie-hunting had always been a dangerous thing. Every zombie hunter had put his or her life at risk, and could lose it at any time.</p> <p>Therefore, as such things often happened, they wouldn’t feel it hard to accept, but…</p> <p>“I will take revenge! If Huo Wu lives, I’ll come back to kill him!” Recalling that it was Huo Wu who destroyed his team, his face twisted slightly with a ferocious look. With hatred and a strong intent of killing, he said through clenched teeth.</p> <p>“And me!” Long Qingying’s cold voice was heard, “I’ll remember what he did to us. From now on, I’ll never show mercy to anyone from the Earth Dragon Base.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them. As she had followed them for quite a while, she had already learned enough from their words and the conversations between Huo Wu and Yang Cheng. Now, she didn’t need to ask them any more questions.</p> <p>She wrote—Are Earth Dragon Base people the reason why Lin Feng and his family are running to Sea City?</p> <p>Finishing writing, she handed the note to Long Qingying.</p> <p>Long Qingying’s look changed after reading the note. She immediately raised her head to look at Lin Qiao, then asked with a deep voice, “How did you know?”</p> <p>Seeing her look, Du Yuanxing leaned his head and read the note as well. After that, the look in his face turned alert as well.</p> <p><em>‘How did this zombie find that out so soon? We didn’t mention it before! He also knew that Lin Feng and his families are running to Sea City, but we didn’t tell him that either! How did he know? Did he make the same kind of deal with Huo Wu and his people as the one he made with us?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao shrugged, showing a careless look while continue writing—’I’ve figured out lots of things. I also know that Huo Wu is guided here by Yang Cheng, the traitor from your team.’</p> <p>After reading that note, Long Qingying directly slapped the note paper on Du Yuanxing’s chest.</p> <p>“You should have killed him before leaving the base!” She said.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing read the note, then looked at Lin Qiao and asked, “Is it really him?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, pushing her sunglasses slightly upward.</p> <p>“I know he has the wind power. He wanted to have the nucleus of the level-four wind-powered zombie all for himself, which is why I didn’t bring him this time. But, I didn’t think that he’d work with the scums from Earth Dragon Base to murder us!”</p> <p>“Next time when we see him, let me kill him,” Long Qingying clenched the hilt of her katana and said with a strong intent of killing.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing glanced at her. He was going to say that he’d kill Yang Cheng himself, but then recalled that Yang Cheng had brought Huo Wu here, and their target was Long Qingying. Because of Huo Wu, they nearly all died.</p> <p>“Alright, you can have him. You’ll let me handle Huo Wu, okay?” Said Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Hearing his words, Long Qingying recollected that there was someone that she wanted to kill even more badly. So, she immediately changed her mind and said, “No, I’ll leave Yang Cheng to you! I’ll kill Huo Wu. You can’t defeat him anyway!”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing didn’t know how to respond…</p> <p>“Ah, where is this place? That one over there… He’s a human boy, right? Who let a child out of the base?” He suddenly looked around and asked Lin Qiao, then pointed at the little boy who was at a short distance and showed an angry look.</p> <p>Children were scarce in the post-apocalyptic era. The female population had dropped, so children became even rarer. For that reason, children were all under heavy protection, and no one was allowed to bring any child out of a base.</p> <p>Therefore, earlier on, almost all the people from the Sea City Base wanted to kill Lu Tianyu for getting Wu Yueling out of the base and leaving her out there.</p> <p>Hearing what Du Yuanxing said, Long Qingying noticed Junjun and the little boy as well. She looked at them for a while, then said with confusion, “How do you know that they’re not both zombies?”</p> <p>While speaking, she turned to look at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>She said that because she had seen Junjun’s face. Her pale-grey eyes and the dark circles under them meant that she was a zombie. So, could a kid in the arms of a zombie be a human being?</p>",
  "Chapter 118: Stick to the Topic": "<p>“I’ve seen him. He has a human face. He’s a human being!” Said Du Yuanxing. He glanced at Lin Qiao with a strange look, then turned to Junjun.</p> <p>He was already looking at a strange zombie who could write notes, so he guessed that the zombie over there must be unusual as well. Otherwise, why would this sun-glasses-stealing zombie trust the other one with the little boy? Since this male zombie had saved him twice, he believed that he wouldn’t watch the little boy be hurt by other zombies.</p> <p><em>‘Are they… a family? Are those two his wife and son?’</em></p> <p>Du Yuanxing looked at Lin Qiao and thought. He thought that Lin Qiao was a male zombie; so when he saw Junjun and the little boy, he began making guesses about their relationships.</p> <p>The short distance and the look in Du Yuanxing’s face allowed Lin Qiao to sense his thoughts faintly. She could accept to be seen as a male zombie. However, being seen as Junjun’s husband, and the father of that little boy who would cry at the sight of her…</p> <p>That was something she couldn’t accept!</p> <p><em>‘Oi, do you still have time to guess about our relationships? Aren’t you supposed to worry about your own situation?’ </em>She thought and couldn’t help but roll her eyes.</p> <p>At that point, Long Qingying was still confused. She looked at Lin Qiao and asked, “What is this place? They are…”</p> <p>While speaking, she pointed at Junjun.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t want to lie about her space, so she wrote on the paper— <em>‘This is my space. You can see me as a space-powered zombie. That boy is a human being. I saved him on my way here. That zombie might be his mother. She won’t hurt the boy. She has lost her memories, but she still has her humanity.’</em></p> <p>After reading the note, Long Qingying glanced at Junjun with a strange look, then turned to Du Yuanxing. Both she and Du Yuanxing were wearing a look of disbelief.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing stared at the little boy while asking, “That female zombie… Won’t she bite the boy?”</p> <p>Human beings believed that once a zombie sensed the scent of a human being, it would immediately rush up to bite the human. The two of them didn’t understand how had the female zombie been managing to hold the boy without eating him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wrote— <em>‘She only lost her memories, not her humanity. And, the boy might be his son. Her instincts aren’t allowing her to hurt him.’</em></p> <p>Du Yuanxing read the note, then turned to Lin Qiao and asked, “Will it bite us?”</p> <p>Long Qingying was looking at Lin Qiao as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao bared her pair of sharp canine teeth toward them, but Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing didn’t understand her meaning.</p> <p><em>‘Would she stand over there so quietly if she wanted to bite you?’ </em>Lin Qiao wrote down.</p> <p>Reading the note, Du Yuanxing asked with doubts, “Will she really not bite us? Isn’t she a zombie? If that boy is her son, it’d be reasonable for her not to bite him. But, why doesn’t she bite us? Aren’t we delicious for her?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao sniffed at him and then wrote— <em>‘You’re not as delicious as women indeed. But, isn’t this a little off-topic? Shouldn’t you be thinking about what to do next? Why do you care so much about that zombie? I’m a zombie too. Would you like me to take a bite off you?’</em></p> <p>Du Yuanxing took over the new note from Lin Qiao. After reading it, both he and Long Qingying automatically drew back for two steps.</p> <p>“I’m surprised that you’re a space-powered zombie! Can a zombie really possess space power?” Du Yuanxing asked abruptly. There were currently a considerable number of superpowered human beings, because it was easier for human beings to trigger superpowers than it was for zombies.</p> <p>The total number of zombies was tens, or even a hundred times more than that of human beings, but only ten percent of them could manage to trigger superpowers at level-three and step into level four. Therefore, the number of high-level zombies was rather small.</p> <p>Space-powered people were rare among human beings, which meant that space-powered zombies were even scarcer among zombies.</p> <p>At that point, Long Qingying’s patience was almost worn out by Du Yuanxing’s off-topic questions. So, she couldn’t help but say to him, “He’s asking you what you are gonna do next. Why do you care so much about his space power?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded in agreement.</p> <p><em>‘You were nearly killed by someone just now. Your teammates have all died, but you and an equally strong one survived. So, what are you going to do next? Will you go back to the base? Or stay out here? Or, do you plan to leave the South and find a new life in one of the other bases?’ </em>These were the questions that Lin Qiao wanted to ask Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Before he responded, Long Qingying continued, “I can’t return to my base. Both Huo Wu and Long Yubai won’t leave me alone. I prepare to leave to Sea City. On the way, I’ll also try finding Lin Feng and his people.”</p> <p>While she was speaking, an idea suddenly emerged in her head, making her stare at Lin Qiao and ask, “And, I’m thinking that maybe you’ve found out the things about our Chief long ago, and you were just trying us earlier. Am I right?”</p> <p>She was thinking that maybe the zombie in front of her did know Lin Feng and his family. He might have heard about the things that happened to Lin Feng and the others before, and just wanted to verify the information he had. He happened to find Du Yuanxing and his people in trouble, so he saved them and conveniently asked them about Lin Feng.</p> <p>She believed that explained why the zombie knew that Lin Feng and his family was heading toward Sea City.</p> <p>Hearing her words, Lin Qiao nodded.</p> <p>To her surprise, Long Qingying made up an excuse for her, and she would surely like to borrow it.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing stopped staring at Junjun and the little boy curiously, then turned to Lin Qiao while carefully thinking over what Long Qingying had said.</p> <p><em>‘If Long Qingying is right about that this zombie knows about what has happened to Lin Feng before meeting us…’ he thought, ‘…is he an enemy or a friend then? At first, he claimed to be a friend, but who knows if that’s true or not? We don’t know this zombie, so we can’t prove if his words are real.’</em></p> <p><em>‘But, since he has saved us twice, he doesn’t look like an enemy. However, I didn’t see him hurting Huo Wu and his people either.’</em></p> <p>Thinking that way, Du Yuanxing began doubting Lin Qiao’s purpose.</p> <p>“Why are you asking about Lin Feng and his family?” He asked.</p> <p>As Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing finally began talking about the important matter, Lin Qiao wrote on the paper—’I’m going to find them now, and then I’m going to help them. That’s why I’m now asking about them.’</p> <p>Long Qingying read the note, then glanced at Du Yuanxing. After that, she turned to ask Lin Qiao, “Are you really gonna help them?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded in response.</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at her with composure while continuing, “If you kill Huo Wu and his people out there earlier, we might believe you.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shrugged and wrote—’I don’t kill human beings without reason. I’ll kill him when I have to. Moreover, I can’t defeat him easily. He’s a level-six.”</p> <p>She could kill people, but that needed to depend on the circumstances. Her first priority now was to find Lin Feng and his family. If, after that, she felt that it was necessary to kill Huo Wu, she would come back and do it.</p>",
  "Chapter 119: The Other Self": "<p>“So, are you going to Sea City to find Lin Feng?” Long Qingying asked.<br/>\nLin Qiao nodded at her in response.</p> <p>“Are you going to find our Great Captain?” Du Yuanxing asked the same question.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded again and wrote—’I’ve got the information I needed, so I won’t stay here.’</p> <p>“Since you’re going to look for them, can I come with you?” Asked Long Qingying.</p> <p>Finishing speaking, she glanced at Junjun and the little boy. After learning that the boy was a human being, she felt she couldn’t bear to leave the kid with two zombies.</p> <p>She wasn’t able to return to the base now, and it wasn’t safe for her to stay our here. So, she decided to go and find Lin Feng and his family too.</p> <p>Besides, she also wanted to know if what Lin Qiao said was real. For the time being, she chose to believe that the latter was really going to help Lin Feng and his family.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing looked at Long Qingying with surprise. He knew that she had been planning to find Lin Feng, but didn’t think that she would do it with a zombie. He believed that it would be very dangerous. After all, they didn’t know anything about the zombie and his zombie friends yet.</p> <p>“You’re going with him? That’s too dangerous!” While thinking, he couldn’t help but say it out loud.</p> <p>He didn’t think that the zombie’s words were believable. Perhaps, the zombie had some unknown bad intentions toward Lin Feng and his family. If so, would the zombie and his friends murder Long Qingying if she hindered them?</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the two with composure, remaining silent.</p> <p>Long Qingying understood what Du Yuanxing meant, and why he felt that way. She glanced at Lin Qiao; she wanted to figure out the zombie’s true purpose, which was dangerous indeed. However, it would be dangerous too if she tried finding Lin Feng by herself. If she encountered a peak-level-four or level-five zombie alone, she would be dead.</p> <p>In comparison, she preferred to follow this strange zombie. At least, this zombie seemed to be friendly.</p> <p>“I believe he won’t hurt me. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have saved us twice.” She looked at Lin Qiao and said to Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>“But…” Du Yuanxing wanted to say something else, but seeing the look of determination in her eyes, he stopped talking.</p> <p>Long Qingying turned to him and said, “Since you’re so worried about me, why don’t you go to Sea City with me? All your teammates have been killed, and you’re all alone now. If you return to the base, you may get into trouble, let alone being able to take revenge.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing fell into silence; Long Qingying was right. At this point, he was in the same situation as Long Qingying. Earlier, he had no direct connection with Lin Feng and his family. But this time, as he was with Long Qingying and had disappeared while fighting against Huo Wu, he would definitely think of him being on Long Qingying’s side.</p> <p>Therefore, he probably should team up with Long Qingying and go find Lin Feng and his people. One day, Lin Feng would certainly bring him back to the base and take revenge.</p> <p>Moreover, both he and Long Qingying believed that Lin Feng and his brothers and sisters wouldn’t be murdered by Yang Jianhua just so easily.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao wrote on the paper—’Your ‘Chief’, was she Lin Feng’s sister, Lin Qiao?”</p> <p>She had been pondering over this question for long. At first, she was merely guessing, but later on, all the information she collected was leading her to that answer.</p> <p>She was struggling internally. One could only imagine waking up in a strange world and finding that there was another oneself in this world, surrounded by all of one’s family members. How could one feel in such a situation?</p> <p>Lin Qiao started doubting her own life. What was she? She woke up in a strange body. Like her body and face, everything around her didn’t really belong to her.</p> <p>So, she had to figure out about her other self.</p> <p>However, when she learned that there was another herself in this world, she was told that that person was dead!</p> <p>What was happening now?</p> <p>Lin Qiao was confused. At the moment, she could only try finding the answers for all her questions one by one.</p> <p>Long Qingying took over her note and read it, then raised her head to nod at Lin Qiao with a look of admiration. After that, she said, “You’re right. Chief Netherworld Fire’s real name was Lin Qiao. Her power produced a black poisonous fire, which was terrifying! That’s why we named her Netherworld Fire. She wasn’t the only powerful one. None of her brothers and sisters are weak. If the shameless Long Yubai didn’t collude with the Deputy Chief and made him betray her, she wouldn’t have died in the hands of those level-sevens!”</p> <p>While mentioning the death of Netherworld Fire, Long Qingying’s face was filled with anger and hatred. She was angry because of Long Yubai’s ambition, and hated Yang Jianhua for his betrayal.</p> <p>Hearing Long Qingying’s words, Lin Qiao gave a start first, as she could scarcely believe it. Things had become different as someone had confirmed her guess.</p> <p>That person was truly her other self. If Netherworld Fire was alone, she might be a different person who was also named Lin Qiao. But Lin Feng, Lin Wenwen, and all her other family members… That couldn’t be explained by mere repetition of names, could it?</p> <p>And, who was Yang Jianhua?</p> <p>Lin Qiao was shocked, but still, she had questions in her head. She thought for a moment and then wrote—”Are Lin Qiao’s younger brother and sister named Lin Wenwen and Lin Hao?”</p> <p>After reading the note, Long Qingying looked at her with surprise and asked, “Yeah, don’t you know that? Didn’t you say that you know Lin Feng? But, why didn’t you know the names of his younger brother and sister?”</p> <p>“I know it. I just want to confirm it,”—wrote Lin Qiao. She wanted to confirm if the other her… truly existed. At that moment, she truly didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>Long Qingying remained silent, looking at Lin Qiao. She felt that this zombie was turning stranger and stranger.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing, who stood beside Long Qingying, spent a moment thinking about what she said, then nodded abruptly and said, “Alright, I’ll go find Great Captain with you. There’s no place for us in the South anyway. I’d rather follow Great Captain than stay here.”</p> <p>While speaking, he wistful face turned toward the direction of Hades Base. But as he raised his head, he saw nothing but the white fog.</p> <p>He had forgotten that he was in a zombie’s space.</p> <p>As Du Yuanxing agreed to come with her, Long Qingying silently sighed with relief. With him, she finally didn’t need to travel with a few strange zombies all alone.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was going to ask Long Qingying to join her, but to her surprise, both of them agreed to come with her even before she brought it up. Before, she was thinking about how to coax this cold woman to join her. However, things were going smoother than she had thought.</p> <p>But now, she still needed to figure out one thing.</p> <p>She picked up the paper and wrote— <em>‘You said that Netherworld Fire was murdered by people from the Earth Dragon Base and a traitor named Yang Jianhua. Who is Yang Jianhua?’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 120: Fake Kindness": "<p>Lin Qiao believed that if Netherworld Fire was really her, she should know the guy named Yang Jianhua as well. After all, she would never let an unfamiliar person be her right-hand man.</p> <p>However, she didn’t know anyone named Yang Jianhua. So, she wondered who that man was.</p> <p>Long Qingying read her note, then responded, “Yang Jianhua met Chief after the apocalypse. I heard that he saved Chief’s life when she was dying, so she and her family all saw him as a savior. However, I’ve also heard that Yang Jianghua was exactly the reason why Chief was trapped in a zombie city that time, but she didn’t know it!”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao frowned slightly, thinking that there were still many things for her to figure out.</p> <p>Unlike her, Du Yuanxing’s expression changed utterly as he stared at Long Qingying in disbelief and shouted, “What? Are you saying that Yang Jianhua entrapped Chief on purpose, then went to save her? Why? Chief wasn’t strong yet back at that time, was she? Did he know that she was gonna build a base later?”</p> <p>Long Qingying glanced at him and said, “No, Yang Jianghua did that because he wanted Lin Wenwen. He needed an opportunity to get close to her family. Chief Netherworld Fire was still weak back then, so he entrapped her and saved her. Poor Chief! She was so grateful to him, and after that, she kept him by her side to protect and help him to grow stronger. But, that dark-minded scum wasn’t touched by the gratitude of Chief and her family, but had been harassing Lin Wenwen the whole time.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing widened his eyes as he couldn’t believe what he had heard. “Do you mean he entrapped Chief to get close to Lin Wenwen? How could that scum do something like that! Chief’s family don’t know about that, do they?” He said angrily, “Otherwise, why would they protect him like a family member? The entire base knows how nice Chief was to him, but what did that scum do? He betrayed the base and murdered our Chief! He’s still chasing Lin Feng and the others now!”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing thought that the people from Earth Dragon Base must have made very attractive offers, so Yang Jianghua betrayed Chief and her family who had been looking after him; he thought that Yang Jianhua was just an ungrateful person.</p> <p>However, now he learned that Yang Jianghua was not only ungrateful, but more like a poisonous snake which had stayed by Chief’s side and quietly waited for an opportunity.</p> <p>Thinking about that, he was getting more and more wrathful.</p> <p>Long Qingying gave a cold smile and said, “Poor Chief! Perhaps, till the end of her life, she still didn’t know that the scum had been taking her kindness for granted. He even used her to promote his own position in the base.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao knitted her brows on hearing their conversation. She couldn’t have thought that something like that had happened to her other self. The other Lin Qiao kept an evil man by her side as her savior, and ended up being murdered by him!</p> <p>At first, she felt like hearing the story of the other person. But somehow, she sensed that something seemed to emerge in her head as she heard the word ‘savior’. However, when she thought about it carefully, she got nothing.</p> <p>Why would that happen?</p> <p>“Such an a*shole! Do Great Captain and his family now know about that?” Du Yuanxing said through gritted teeth.</p> <p>Long Qingying shook her head and responded, “I don’t think so, unless Yang Jianhua told them himself. I only heard about that after I had sent them away.”</p> <p>Back at that time, she knew where Lin Wenwen and her family members were heading to, and also knew that an ambush was waiting for them. Therefore, she told Lin Wenwen and the others that a large and heavily armored enemy force was waiting for them, so they better take another way to leave.</p> <p>She saved Lin Feng and the rest by telling them about the ambush.</p> <p>Soon after that, she overheard a secret conversation between Yang Jianhua and some Earth Dragon Base people. That was how she learned about Yang Jianghua’s scheme.</p> <p>Some people said that Yang Jianghua betrayed his base because Long Yubai happened to save his life; others believed that Long Yubai had seduced Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>But in fact, those weren’t true. The truth was that Yang Jianhua was just one of Long Yubai’s sexual partners. He liked Long Yubai, so he gave him his entire base.</p> <p>Long Yubai cared nothing about Yang Jianghua. However, he still fawned over the latter because he wanted the Hades Base.</p> <p>Long Qingying was the only one on Lin Feng’s side who knew about these things. She wanted to find Lin Feng and his people, because she planned to tell them about all this.</p> <p>“The most important thing for now is to find Great Captain, don’t you agree?” Long Qingying asked while turning to Lin Qiao. The latter was thinking about the whole Yang Jianhua problem and her other self, as well as her current situation…</p> <p>Hearing Long Qingying’s question, she stopped wondering and nodded. Long Qingying was right; the top priority now was to find Lin Feng and his family.</p> <p>She turned to walk to the furniture area. Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing didn’t know what she was doing, so they silently watched her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found a training suit which was as same as the one she was wearing, then threw it at Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing caught the suit, then realized that his clothes were all wet. And then, he found something strange.</p> <p>“Eh?”</p> <p>Hearing his voice, Long Qingying and Lin Qiao both turned toward him.</p> <p>They saw Du Yuanxing holding the clothes and lowering his head to look at his chest, then check his hands and touch his face.</p> <p>“Oh my! My skin doesn’t hurt anymore! Why? My skin tissue isn’t burned to death, is it? Is my sense of pain gone?” he said.</p> <p>Even though his words sounded ridiculous, Long Qingying and Lin Qiao had noticed his condition as well. Before he was thrown into the lake by Lin Qiao, he was already burned by Huo Wu’s fire for a while. He knew that back then, his skin had already begun swelling and peeling.</p> <p>Huo Wu’s fire had an incredibly high temperature, and was way more harmful than ordinary flames.</p> <p>However, Du Yuanxing couldn’t sense any pain at the moment. He checked his skin and found that new skin had actually grown out under his burned skin. When he touched those wounds, he only felt itchy.</p> <p>He didn’t understand what had happened to him, but Lin Qiao did. However, even she didn’t think that the lake water could heal his wounds so fast. Du Yuanxing was soaked in the water for a short while, but all his burns were actually healed.</p> <p>That was amazing!</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that the water of the lake in her space was almost like a magic water which could heal all sorts of injuries and diseases, for both human beings and zombies…</p> <p>Somehow, she suddenly felt that Du Yuanxing was very lucky.</p> <p><em>‘He was healed by soaking in the lake for a short while. I should have asked him to pay me. It seems that I should treat this lake well from now on!’ </em>She thought.</p>",
  "Chapter 121: Inconceivable": "<p>When Lin Qiao prepared to go and check the situation outside, then leave with Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing, Long Qingying suddenly noticed something by the lakeside and walked over with confusion.</p> <p>As she moved, Lin Qiao turned to where she was looking at, then recalled that the wind-powered zombie’s body was still in her space.</p> <p>“Is this…a zombie?” Long Qingying soon walked over and stood by the zombie’s body, asking a question.</p> <p>“Eh? Isn’t this that level-four wind-powered zombie?” Du Yuanxing walked over as well. He soon saw the zombie’s body clearly and spoke with surprise.</p> <p>“So, it is already killed by you.” He looked at the zombie body and said regretfully. Then, he raised his head to look around and found more strange things.</p> <p>“Eh… what are those? Strawberries? Vegetables? And those piled over there are mutant pumpkins and potatoes, right? Eh…what’s your name? No, I mean…do you have a name? Hmm…I was trying to ask why you got these into your space. Aren’t you a zombie?” He was stunned a little when he saw the fruits and vegetables piled on the grass, so he even failed to organize his language well.</p> <p>Hearing him, Long Qingying turned to those fruits and vegetables as well. She saw some strawberry plants among the grasses, and some vegetables, next to which was a hill-sized pile of giant mutant pumpkins and potatoes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to them. Seeing their face showing puzzles, she wrote on the notepad—’I killed that zombie not long ago, haven’t got the time to throw it out. All these vegetables and plants are edible for human beings. They’re that boy’s food.”</p> <p>Long Qingying took over the note and read it, then was shocked. She stared at Lin Qiao with wide opened eyes while handing the note to Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>“You feed him those? Aren’t you killing him? These are all mutant vegetables, and could turn him into a zombie!” Long Qingying said with both anger and disbelief.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and wrote—’That’s not true. These are all virus-free. That boy has been eating these for days. Doesn’t he look healthy even now?’</p> <p>After handing the note to Long Qingying, she pointed at Junjun.</p> <p>“How can it be possible!” Both Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying stared at Lin Qiao, then turned to the little boy. Due to the far distance, they couldn’t see him clearly.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing had seen the boy’s face just now. Even though he felt that the boy wasn’t a zombie, he didn’t manage to see his face color clearly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to clap her hands toward Junjun, then pointed at the little boy and crooked her finger. Junjun knew her meaning, so she carried the little boy and slowly walked to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>She could restrain herself when sensing the boy’s aroma, but the scents of the two strange human beings made her feel like drooling. However, her mind had grown stronger and clearer, so she could still control her desire of feeding on human beings.</p> <p>As Junjun walked over with the little boy, Long Qingying looked at the back of the boy who had buried his face in the female zombie’s arms, feeling that the boy was very reliant on it.</p> <p>She alertly walked to behind the female zombie to see the boy’s face. While keeping vigilance against Junjun, she started observing the boy’s face.</p> <p>She found that the boy was little pale and scrawny, but his eyes were very clear and bright, and he was staring at her curiously and timidly.</p> <p>The boy seemed to be less afraid of Lin Qiao after she cut her hair and started wearing the sunglasses. He widely opened his eyes, looking around silently.</p> <p>The boy was really fine! His face was showing no sign of infection.</p> <p>“Did you really feed him these…?” Long Qingying started to lose her composure as she was stunned, curious, and confused. She looked at Lin the little boy with a complicated expression, then at those fruits and vegetables, and finally at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at her very patiently.</p> <p>She wanted very much to go out at the moment, but Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing kept discovering things and asking her questions. So, she couldn’t help but write— <em>‘I prepare to leave now. I’m going out to take a look first, so you two stay here.’</em></p> <p>She handed the note to Long Qingying, then patted Junjun on her shoulder and told her to go back to the small space.</p> <p>Junjun immediately turned back and walked away from the two human beings with the boy, leaving the two with a confused look. Next, Lin Qiao turned around and vanished before their eyes.</p> <p>She exited her space in the invisible state. Once out, she found Huo Wu, his people, and Yang Cheng, who stood by their side.</p> <p>“Search carefully!” Huo Wu stood on a high stage, hands behind back and yelling at his soldiers who seemed to be searching for something.</p> <p>“Yes, sir!”</p> <p>Yang Cheng stood beside the stage, watching those soldiers searching around.</p> <p>Huo Wu’s two fire dragons were hovering in the sky, pouncing on every zombie that attempted to approach. The zombies which were attacked by the fire dragons were soon wrapped in flame and incinerated into ashes.</p> <p>“Why did they disappear? Was there any space-powered person?” Yang Cheng raised his head to talk to Huo Wu.</p> <p>“I guessed so too. But, that space-powered person can’t possibly save them right in front of me without even showing his own face, can he? I saw nothing! God knows what happened!” Huo Wu barked angrily with a dark look on his face.</p> <p>That space-powered person saved Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing from him without even showing up. But, no one had ever heard about any invisible space-powered person.</p> <p>“Since they entered the space from here, that space-powered man will certainly appear here again. As long as we wait here, we’ll be able to find him. We can always catch him,” Yang Cheng smiled and said. However, neither of them noticed that an invisible figure had silently shown up and approached them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was planning to leave right after she came out. But when she saw Yang Cheng, she had a different idea. So, she jumped directly into action.</p> <p>Yang Cheng had no idea that a hand was slowly reaching toward him. He was wondering if Huo Wu had killed Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing or not. He only knew that the two people had disappeared, but didn’t know if they were dead or just injured.</p> <p>However, as Huo Wu seemed to be so wrathful at the moment, he didn’t dare to ask him about that. If Huo Wu were infuriated, he would suffer too.</p> <p>At that point, an invisible hand reached under his arm. Next, the hand suddenly turned visible and swiftly grabbed his arm.</p> <p>In the next second, Yang Cheng disappeared right next to Huo Wu’s legs.</p> <p>“Eh?” Huo Wu immediately turned around as he found that Yang Cheng seemed to have moved. But after that, he didn’t even see a trace of the latter.</p>",
  "Chapter 122: Sneak Attack": "<p>“Damn! Who’s it? Show your face! You sneaky coward! Come out and fight me face to face!” After watching someone disappear before his eyes for the third time, Huo Wu made a circle on the stage and then burst in raging yells.</p> <p>However, no one responded.</p> <p>As he was nearly losing control of himself, his fire dragons madly danced in the sky and destroyed the surrounding tall buildings and trees, leaving burning flames on them.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Lin Qiao’s space, Yang Cheng hadn’t realized what was happening. Earlier on, he felt that someone suddenly dragged his arm, and then his eyes were dazzled. When he could see again, he found that he was in a different place.</p> <p>“Eh! Em…” Before he could figure out a thing about this strange place, a hand suddenly clasped his throat. He gave a muffled moan and then began struggling, trying to free himself from that hand.</p> <p>The owner of the hand locked his throat from behind him, so he was supposed to shake it off easily. However, no matter how hard he tried, he wasn’t able to get rid of that hand. That hand gripped his throat even tighter and tighter.</p> <p>He even started to believe that that hand was able to directly crumble his throat, as he felt like his neck was clenched in a giant iron pincer.</p> <p>“Yang Cheng! Hah, I didn’t think that I’d see you again!” A voice was suddenly heard from next to his ear, laughing viciously. Yang Cheng felt that the man who was talking hated him so much that he even wanted to bite him.</p> <p>Yang Cheng was startled on hearing the voice. He immediately turned his head to see the owner of it. But, the voice was coming from behind him. As he couldn’t turn his head around at the moment, he had no way of seeing that man’s face.</p> <p>However, he recognized that voice.</p> <p>“Captain, if you want to talk, why don’t you come to talk face to face with me? Why’re you hiding behind?” Yang Cheng seemed to be a little panicked, but he forced himself to calm down and speak sarcastically.</p> <p>“I don’t need to, because I don’t want to see your flunky face. That’s way too disgusting.” Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying stood behind Lin Qiao, watching her easily suppress Yang Cheng, who was taller than her, with one single hand.</p> <p>While locking Yang Cheng’s neck with one hand, Lin Qiao disarmed him with the other hands, then threw all of his guns at Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>“Hah, do you think you can live a better life by following that Earth Dragon Base scum named Huo Wu? You might have been able to live if you didn’t guide him here, but sadly, you’ve dug your own grave by bringing him here. I can’t kill Huo Wu now, but I can certainly kill you,” Du Yuanxing sneered.</p> <p>Earlier on, when Lin Qiao exited the space, Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying thought that she was going to leave this place. But to their surprise, she returned in a couple of minutes with a man in her hand.</p> <p>The two of them were preparing to take a good look at the things in this space, but once they saw that man, they had forgotten about this strange space completely.</p> <p>After taking away all Yang Cheng’s guns, Lin Qiao pushed him away.</p> <p>Yang Cheng staggered a few steps forward and nearly fell to the ground. When he finally found his footing, he saw Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying, as well as a man wearing a sunglasses, his face covered in scars.</p> <p>He recognized Du Yuanxing’s sunglasses.</p> <p>He glanced at the three, then quickly looked around. Just now, when his throat was locked, he had already seen what was before him clearly.</p> <p>After seeing Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying, he figured that he was in the mysterious space-powered man’s space.</p> <p>“I didn’t think that you had found a space-powered man’s help you! This is a large space!” He turned to stare at the three and spoke.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying looked at him blandly without responding while Lin Qiao stepped backward, prepared to watch a show.</p> <p>“What do you want? Why did you bring me into this space? Do you want to kill me? Aren’t you afraid that Huo Wu might destroy you once you go out? He and his people are guarding outside. He’s so angry about you two disappearing right in front of him. And now, you have got me in here too. You were trying to challenge him, right? Even if you manage to escape from here, can you ever survive his pursuit?” Yang Cheng said to Long Qingying and Du Yuancheng while looking at Lin Qiao out of the corners of his eyes.</p> <p>He figured that this strange man was that mysterious space-powered person. He was surprised that this man who was shorter than himself and relatively skinny actually had a great strength. Earlier on when this man locked his throat, he was even disabled from moving.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing looked at him coldly and said, “I’ve told you that you’re too greedy, and that one day, your greed will get you killed. But, I never thought that it would happen so soon.”</p> <p>Yang Cheng used to be Du Yuanxing’s friend and teammate, but he betrayed the latter for his own good. Du Yuanxing wasn’t sad about it, because he had gotten used to things like that during the past five years. Right now, he had nothing but the intention of killing in his heart.</p> <p>He didn’t betray anyone, but someone wanted him dead. In this case, he didn’t think that he needed to show any mercy. In the post-apocalypse world, only the powerful ones could survive until the end. Out of the base, killing was allowed.</p> <p>Clang!</p> <p>Before Yang Cheng could respond, Long Qingying pulled out her katana and pointed it at him. Meanwhile, she said to Du Yuanxing, “Cut the crap! If you’re not gonna do it, I’ll do it for you!” Her face was cold and gaze was sharp. The strong intention of killing was radiating from her entire body.</p> <p>“No. You’ve said that you’ll let me handle him,” Du Yuanxing took a step forward and raised an arm to stop Long Qingying. His eyes were fixed on Yang Cheng, with one hand sparkling with electric light.</p> <p>Seeing Du Yuanxing’s move, Yang Cheng automatically took a step backward and shouted in panic, “Wait for a second! If you kill me, you’d be dead once you’re out of this space! Huo Wu will burn all of you!”</p> <p>He was a level lower than Du Yuanxing. Even though he was already at the peak of level-four, his power still couldn’t be compared with Du Yuanxing’s, not to mention the fact that the latter’s electric power was perfect for attacking.</p> <p>“He’ll try to burn us whether we kill you or not!” Du Yuanxing curved his lips in a sarcastic smile. However, his eyes were showing no trace of joy, but only the cold, murderous intention.</p> <p>Nevertheless, as he prepared to launch a lethal attack, he paused suddenly, then turned his head to look at the electric currents on his hands with an expression of confusion.</p> <p>There were electric currents on his hands indeed, but why couldn’t he throw them out? He refused to believe this, so he swung his arm toward Yang Cheng again.</p> <p>However, nothing happened…</p>",
  "Chapter 123: He Died In The Lake": "<p>As Du Yuanxing was attacking, Yang Cheng’s automatic reflex was to cross his arms before his face and prepare to dodge by using his wind power.</p> <p>However, his feet didn’t feel any wind… That wasn’t right; he did feel a wind, but it wasn’t strong enough to support his body!</p> <p>After realizing that, he froze in shock. Without the help of the wind, he immediately felt that Du Yuanxing’s attack was going to land on his body.</p> <p>‘I’m dead!’ He thought. But then, as he prepared himself for the electric strike, nothing happened.</p> <p>He didn’t understand. He thought something was wrong with himself when failing to trigger his wind power, but why didn’t Du Yuanxing attack him? He confusedly dropped his hands to look at Du Yuanxing, then found that the latter was staring as his sparkling hands.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing too looked bewildered.</p> <p>At that point, Du Yuanxing noticed Yang Cheng’s move, so he raised his head and made eye contact with him. They saw the confusion in each other’s eyes, then both paused.</p> <p>But soon, Du Yuanxing took the initiative to attack. After realizing that he couldn’t use his electric power at the moment, he learned from Yang Cheng’s look that his power was disabled as well. So, he immediately pulled the pistol which was carried on his belt.</p> <p>Seeing Du Yuanxing pull out a gun, Yang Cheng was frightened, then turned and ran right away.</p> <p>Yang Cheng’s guns had been taken away by Lin Qiao, so by now, he had no way to fight back. When he turned around, he found a lake and a grassland. The grassland was too far away, but the lake was relatively close.</p> <p>So, he made a prompt decision and jumped into the lake.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>A gunshot was heard In the space, vibrating the air and echoing for a while.</p> <p>Plop!</p> <p>Following a plop, Yang Cheng jumped into the lake. But soon, the water near him turned red.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t see him, but soon sensed the scent of blood. So, she immediately figured out that Yang Cheng was shot, but couldn’t know if he was dead or not.</p> <p>“He has been shot! But, he jumped into the lake. Is there anything at the bottom of your lake?” Long Qingying ran to the lakeside and saw the blood spreading on the water surface. She stared at the water for a short while, but failed to see Yang Cheng.</p> <p>So, she asked Lin Qiao that.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment. She didn’t think anything existed down there except for those vines.</p> <p>She shook her head while standing by the lake and watching the rippling water surface. Then, she began wondering what would Yang Cheng turn into.</p> <p>She was never hurt by the lake, but Xie Dong was turned into a strange zombie in the lake, and the wind-powered zombie was drained. Yang Cheng had jumped in as a living human being, so she couldn’t tell what would happen to him.</p> <p>The lake was more mysterious than she had imagined.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing walked to the lakeside with the gun. The three of them stood side by side, staring at the rippling water surface.</p> <p>“Isn’t this your space? Don’t you know what’s in there? Then, why did you throw me in earlier?” Du Yuanxing thought that Lin Qiao didn’t know what was in the lake as he saw her shaking her head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him without responding.</p> <p>Long Qingying carried her katana, her eyes fixed on the lake surface.</p> <p>A minute later, the three of them found that the lake surface was still rippling, without showing a sign of calming down. Before, this lake had always been peaceful, but now, it just wouldn’t stop rippling.</p> <p>Those ripples clearly told the three that Yang Cheng must have encountered something down in the lake.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, they finally saw something slowly floating up from the deeper area of the lake. From the clothes, they recognized it as none other than Yang Cheng.</p> <p>Yang Cheng floated up to surface motionlessly, face down and back up. The strange thing was that he wasn’t floating on the surface like a normal corpse should. A normal corpse should be nearly soaking in the water, with only a part of its head and back exposed. But unlike that, he was floating there like a dried piece of wood. Almost his entire body was above the water surface, as if he was a plastic dummy.</p> <p>“What’s going on…? Is he dead?” Du Yuanxing stared at Yang Cheng’s body and asked. Lin Qiao sniffed at the air. She sensed no scent of living human beings from Yang Cheng, which meant he was dead indeed.</p> <p>But now, she was thinking about something else.</p> <p>A dead man was now soaking in the lake… Earlier on, a zombie was soaked in, and now, there was a dead man… So, should she drink from this lake again or not?</p> <p>She knew that the lake water was able to wash the virus away, and the lake was rather large. But, she still couldn’t accept drinking the water which had soaked a dead zombie and a dead man…</p> <p><em>‘Eh? But I’ve been taking a bath in the lake all this while. Why didn’t I feel disgusted earlier on when drinking from the lake? Haven’t I been drinking my own bath water?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Damn! I suddenly feel a little disgusted! What should I do?’</em></p> <p>Then, she recalled that she had been cooking for the little boy with the water in the lake as well. She comforted herself that it would be fine. She told herself that the lake was large and full of water, so she wouldn’t happen to drink her own bath water…</p> <p>Moreover, she had been avoiding her bathing spot!</p> <p>At that moment, Yang Cheng’s body moved toward the three of them, as if something was pushing it.</p> <p>“Is there something in the lake?” Seeing that, both Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing took a few steps backward, then pointed at Yang Cheng’s body and asked Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao came back to her senses, then found that Yang Cheng’s body was getting closer and closer to them. She immediately took off her sunglasses to look at the lake.</p> <p>She saw a long and faint figure down in the water. That thin, tentacle-like thing was pushing Yang Cheng to the lakeside.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was familiar with that thing, as it was nothing else but a green vine from the lake bottom. <em>‘How did Yang Cheng die? He didn’t drown, did he? Did Du Yuanxing shoot him to death?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>She saw the vine draw back toward the lake bottom after sending Yang Cheng’s body to the shallow area, about three meters away from her feet. After that, she bent over to roll up her pants and take off her shoes, then walked into the water.</p> <p>Yang Cheng’s body was about three meters away from the lakeside, but as the water was shallow in this area, Lin Qiao walked straight to him and dragged him back to the lakeside.</p> <p>However, after coming back ashore, she found that the bottoms of her trouser legs were still wetted.</p> <p>She didn’t care about that, but immediately squatted by the corpse to try figuring out the reason for his death, and why he looked different from normal corpses.</p>",
  "Chapter 124: The Drained Yang Cheng": "<p>As Yang Cheng’s body was dragged ashore, Lin Qiao, Du Yuanxing, and Long Qingying were all confused by what they saw. But of course, Lin Qiao was still able to figure something out.</p> <p>She had sensed something strange when dragging Yang Cheng’s body out of the water. A while ago, he was a living human being, but now, it had become a completely lifeless dead body.</p> <p>However, his body wasn’t as heavy as normal corpses, but was very light.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed that when dragging him in the water. He was an adult man, about five feet and eight inches tall; he wasn’t fat, but wasn’t scrawny either. He should be at least sixty kilograms in weight. However, Lin Qiao didn’t feel that she was dragging a sixty kilogram object.</p> <p>Instead, she felt that he had lost a half of his weight. His body was only about thirty kilograms in weight, and a normal corpse should be way heavier than that.</p> <p>Sometimes, a human body might be heavier after death than it was alive.</p> <p>Why was Yang Cheng’s body so light? Apart from his oddly light weight, his skin was dry, and muscles had shrunk. Not only was his blood drained, but all the moisture of his body was gone.</p> <p>“What… What happened? Is he drained?” Du Yuanxing widened his eyes, staring at Yang Cheng with surprise.</p> <p>About ten minutes ago, Yang Cheng was still talking to him. But by now, he had suddenly become like this. Du Yuanxing felt that it was so scary.</p> <p>It wasn’t the first time for him to see a dead man. After all, what people saw in the post-apocalyptic era the most was nothing but dead people and zombies.</p> <p>However, he was frightened indeed as he saw Yang Cheng become like this just a couple of minutes after his death.</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at Lin Qiao, her eyes filled with confusion as well.</p> <p>“What do you have in your lake? Does it eat people?” Du Yuanxing stared at Lin Qiao, his eyes showing fear. He recalled that earlier on, he was thrown into the lake too.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the two of them, then stood up and put on the sunglasses. After that, she wrote a word on the paper—’Ghost.’</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying didn’t know how to respond.</p> <p>Was there really a ghost in the lake? Or, was Lin Qiao lying to them? Anyhow, they both believed that something horrible was hiding in the lake. In their heads, they both marked the lake as extra dangerous.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing squatted, reaching out a finger to poke Yang Cheng’s face. He found that the latter’s facial muscles had become as hard as a dried tree trunk.</p> <p>“Does he still have his energy nucleus? Or, is his energy drained as well?” Asked Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Long Qingying and Lin Qiao were looking Yang Cheng’s twisted face too. Abruptly, Lin Qiao squatted and popped the claws of her right hand.</p> <p>“Eh!” Seeing that, Du Yuanxing automatically sprung up and took a step backward. Lin Qiao glanced at him, then turned back and cut Yang Cheng’s head with her claw.</p> <p>She didn’t tell the two that she hadn’t sensed any energy from Yang Cheng’s body. Earlier on when she got him into the space, he was full of energy; but now, his energy seemed to have disappeared.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>Following a slight noise, Yang Cheng’s head was cut open like a watermelon. Then, the three of them saw something interesting.</p> <p>Yang Cheng’s brain had shrunk and dried as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t help but poke at the dried brain with her claw. She found that it was hard, like a piece of air-dried sponge. Then, she directly dug the brain out and tried to break it with her hands. A small piece of the brain fell off quite easily and turned into powders.</p> <p><em>‘What the hell! Why did his brain become like this?’ </em>Lin Qiao wondered. She continued breaking it, and soon, the brain was crumbled, exposing a white and lusterless energy nucleus.</p> <p>The energy nucleus had a similar shape as a zombie nuclei. As Lin Qiao pinched it, it turned into powder without releasing any energy wave.</p> <p>Long Qingying and Du Yuanixng were both shocked. It seemed that not only was Yang Cheng’s body drained, so was his energy.</p> <p>Lin Qiao dusted off her hands and stood up, closing her eyes to observe the outside world. She found that Huo Wu and his people were still guarding out there. This time, those people weren’t searching around, as if they had learned that they wouldn’t be able to find anything.</p> <p>Earlier on, after Lin Qiao dragged Yang Cheng into her space, Huo Wu confirmed that the space-powered person was in that area. So, he planned to wait until Lin Qiao showed up.</p> <p>He believed that Lin Qiao would come out of her space eventually.</p> <p>As far as he knew, many space-powered people were able to bring living human beings into their space. Some of them could have people stay in their space for a longer time, and some shorter. The timespan would vary based on their levels and other factors. But, no matter how, they couldn’t stay in their space forever. They would need to come out of their space eventually.</p> <p>He had guessed right. Lin Qiao surely needed to come out, and that happened very soon.</p> <p>She came out in the invisible state again, then quietly sneaked into a building nearby. Only after running onto the roof of the seven-story building did she show her face.</p> <p>She was holding two objects on showing up. She threw the two objects down the building as fast as possible, then switched back to the invisible state.</p> <p>Thud! Thud!</p> <p>Two strange noises were heard, sounding like something falling onto the concrete floor; it was something much lighter than human bodies, more like wood.</p> <p>Before Huo Wu realized what happened, he saw two human-shaped objects being thrown to the ground before his eyes. He failed even to grasp a trace of the one who had thrown these two things down. He didn’t even sense anything.</p> <p>As two human-body-like objects were suddenly thrown down, the surrounding soldiers were stunned as well, not knowing how to react. They looked at Huo Wu’s dark face and stayed quiet, not daring to move.</p> <p>Huo Wu was now wearing an extremely wrathful look. His eyes corners were slightly twitching, eyes filled with fury, as if a burst of fire was going to erupt from them at any instant. His facial muscles had been twitching as well, with his teeth clenched.</p> <p>Everyone else had sensed the dark vibe radiating from his body.</p> <p>The two dead bodies were thrown to the empty area which was about two meters away from Huo Wu. Whoever threw these bodies down was obviously challenging him and slapping his face.</p> <p>Therefore, no one made any sound.</p> <p>Huo Wu stared at the body which was wearing Yang Cheng’s clothes. He gritted his teeth, trying to calm his anger and killing intent. Afterward, he leaped off the stage and walked to the two bodies, observing them.</p> <p>One of the two bodies was Yang Cheng, while the other one was a zombie. Both of their heads had been cut open, meaning that their nuclei were taken.</p> <p>As Huo Wu was examining the two dead bodies, Lin Qiao had already leaped onto the roof of another building.</p>",
  "Chapter 125: The Two Join the Team": "<p>The invisible Lin Qiao felt that her body had become lighter and nimbler, allowing her to jump between the building roofs easily. She was now able to hop to the top of a lower building from a taller one which was seven or eight meters away.</p> <p>She felt awesome, as if she were flying!</p> <p>After a few leaps, she began to love this feeling.</p> <p>Lin Qiao covered a long distance by moving fleetingly across the roofs like a human-shaped cheetah. Ten minutes later, she was already over ten miles away from Huo Wu.</p> <p>A white figure soon caught up with her, but it wasn’t leaping around like Lin Qiao.</p> <p>That was Qiu Lili, standing elegantly in the air. From time to time, she would flash across the air to change her location. And before long, she showed up next to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Down on the ground, two zombies were running after her.</p> <p>Seeing her, Lin Qiao stopped moving. As Qiu Lili airily landed beside her, she crooked her finger toward the latter.</p> <p>“Roar?”<br/>\n‘Where are the two human beings?’</p> <p>Qiu Lili stood beside Lin Qiao and roared to ask. Earlier on, she had seen Lin Qiao put Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing in her space.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took out the notepad and wrote— <em>‘They’re going to Sea City with me to find some people.’</em></p> <p>“Roar?”<br/>\n<em>‘Back to Sea City?’</em></p> <p>Qiu Lili looked at Lin Qiao with confusion. <em>‘Didn’t you come to this place to find people?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and wrote— <em>‘The people I’m looking for are heading to Sea City now.’</em></p> <p>For that reason, she needed to go back. She wondered where Lin Feng and his family were at the moment.</p> <p>“Ah-Eh… Er…”<br/>\n<em>‘Are you gonna take the two human beings with you?’ </em> Qiu Lili asked grumpily. She didn’t like human beings, so she didn’t want two human beings joining their group.  <em>‘I’m unhappy! We can’t play together anymore!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao felt a little speechless as Qiu Li got emotional like a child.</p> <p>Qiu Lili was powerful, but her state of mind continued to be like that of a teenager. Lin Qiao understood that Qiu Lili hated human beings, so she guessed that she needed to spend some time to convince her.</p> <p>However, this might be an opportunity to make Qiu Lili accept human beings, and also make Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing accept the fact that there were special ones amongst zombies.</p> <p>They wouldn’t hurt human beings, and they didn’t want to be hunted by human beings either.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment, then wrote— <em>‘They can help me. They’re providing me with lots of information.’</em></p> <p>After reading the note, Qiu Lili was still unhappy. She pouted and turned her face, but didn’t make another sound. Lin Qiao smiled, knowing that she had agreed.</p> <p>She leaped down the building, then entered her space and showed up right beside the two human beings. After that, she patted the two on their shoulders and took them out of the space before they could realize what had happened.</p> <p>The two of them were startled and confused.</p> <p>“Eh? Are we out? Eh… Where is this place?” Du Yuanxing reacted fast. He looked around and then asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took out the notepad and wrote— <em>‘This place is over ten miles away from Huo Wu and his people. We’re driving to Sea City now.’</em></p> <p>“Driving? Ah, you have got a car in your space,” Reading the note, Du Yuanxing immediately recalled that he had seen a light off-road car in Lin Qiao’s space.</p> <p>A few zombies driving a car…</p> <p>“Are you really a zombie? You’re not a human being pretending to be a zombie, are you?” He turned to look at Lin Qiao again, as he honestly felt that Lin Qiao was no different from normal human beings, except for the scars on her face.</p> <p>However, lots of human beings had their faces scarred after the apocalypse.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ignored him, disappearing right in front of him and Long Qingying. Soon, she brought out the car and a bucket of gas.</p> <p>After filling up the car, she sat in the driver’s seat. Qiu Lili, who had been standing beside her, silently got in the front seat immediately.</p> <p>It wasn’t the first time for Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying to see this young female zombie. Her clean and pretty white dress was very eye-catching, not to mention the fact that she was actually a zombie.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying glanced at each other. The latter was going to stay on the car roof; but before she moved, Lin Qiao handed her a note.</p> <p><em>‘There’re zombies on the roof, you should sit in the car.’</em></p> <p>Long Qingying felt a little speechless.</p> <p><em>‘More zombies? Isn’t the other zombie sitting in the front seat already?’ </em>She wondered. She thought that Lin Qiao was talking about Qiu Lili, so she glanced at her, who was sitting in the front seat, with confusion.</p> <p>Boom! Boom!</p> <p>Right at that moment, two noises were heard from the car roof.</p> <p>Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing turned back to look outside, and found that two level-three or four zombies were quietly lying on the car roof, staring at them and drooling.</p> <p>Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing felt that these two were definitely normal zombies, as their eyes were dark, and mouths were cracked. The two zombies lay on the car roof on all fours and stared at them as if they were two roasted ducks!</p> <p>“Ah!” Suddenly, Qiu Lili uttered a scream, which awfully startled Lin Qiao and the two human beings. Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing felt that they nearly had a heart attack, while Lin Qiao was sort of getting used to that.</p> <p>Hearing Qiu Lili’s scream, the two zombies immediate turned their heads away and sat straight, no longer staring at the two human beings. But still, they tried to glance at them out of the corners of their eyes.</p> <p>The two human beings immediately got into the car. Sitting in the car, they felt a little less worried. But then, they began wondering if the two zombies would directly pierce their claws into the car and get them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ignored their thoughts and started the car, driving on another way leading to Sea City. With Long Qingying, she now knew which way Lin Feng and his family took. That was exactly the reason why she wanted Long Qingying to join her.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At the same time, back in the Sea City Base, Wu Chengyue returned to where he lived with his daughter, Xiao Yunlong and Mengyue.</p> <p>Even as the accommodation of a base leader, his flat wasn’t luxurious. It was located in a three-story building. He had some fancy furniture pieces, but his place still looked way humbler than that of the other two base leaders.</p> <p>The other base leaders had occupied either the best and safest house, or an entire floor of the nicest and cleanest building. Unlike them, he lived in this ordinary-looking small building with his daughter, Meng Yue, and Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>The three of them had been living together since the apocalypse. At the moment, they looked like good friends and flatmates, but in fact, their relationships were a little complicated.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong fancied Meng Yue, but Meng Yue liked Wu Chengyue. However, Wu Chengyue was all about his daughter, and had completely no interest in any woman. He had seen Meng Yue as his younger sister.</p>",
  "Chapter 126: The News": "<p>As for the reason why these few high-positioned people lived in this small building, it was because the little one didn’t like high or large places.<br/>\nWu Chengyue moved in this place which was fancied by his daughter, so the other two followed.</p> <p>The building of three stories was small. The first floor was the living room and kitchen, the second floor had a study room and two bedrooms, and the third floor had two bedrooms and a balcony.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and the little one each occupied a bedroom on the second floor. He wanted very much to share a room with his daughter, but the little one didn’t like that. Therefore, the father had been banished to the next door. However, he still needed to check on his daughter five or six times a night.</p> <p>Meng Yue and Xiao Yunlong lived on the third floor.</p> <p>Except for themselves and a group of guards, no one would step in this building; no nannies or servants.</p> <p>That was because the little one didn’t like strange people. She wouldn’t even let Xiao Licheng, who often followed Wu Chengyue around as his driver and assistant, get near her.</p> <p>Walking into the living room, Wu Chengyue put the little one on a couch and told her to play by herself. Xiao Yunlong followed behind him, saying, “We’re still trying to verify the message. But, based on experience, I think it’s real. However, no one knows for sure if Netherworld Fire is really dead or not. People are all making guesses now.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue sat on the couch and poured himself a glass of water while saying, “I suppose those people haven’t gotten the message yet. You should send people to tell them about what has happened in the Hades Base first. Don’t mention about their Chief yet, as we don’t know for sure at the moment. That still needs to be verified. Let’s see what they plan to do next.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong stood beside him as he nodded and said, “The news about the base has been confirmed. As for their Chief’s families, do we need to send some people to aid them? If they’re on the run, I think they should be arriving at the edge of Zhe Province by now.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at him and responded, “You should ask Li Zheng and his people if they plan to go and get their Chief’s family themselves. I think it’ll be easier for them than for us. We’ll simply send a squad to help them.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong nodded in agreement.</p> <p>At that moment, Meng Yue sat down beside Wu Chengyue, holding a stack of files. While reading the files, she was also listening to the conversation between the two.</p> <p>“Tomorrow, send your people to tell them about the news, and see what they plan to do. And, have you found any trace of that zombie?” After giving his daughter a cup of water, Wu Chengyue stood up and walked toward the kitchen.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong glanced at the little one and Meng Yue who had been reading files, then followed Wu Chengyue to the kitchen.</p> <p>“No. Are you sure that it’s heading South?” As Wu Chengyue walked into the kitchen while rolling up his sleeves, then took some vegetables out of the refrigerator and prepared to make dinner. Xiao Yunlong leaned against the door frame, crossed his arms, and asked.</p> <p>After the apocalypse, people mainly used solar power. Some had generators, but as generators needed to be powered by gas, and gas was rather precious in the post-apocalyptic era, people rarely put them to use.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s place was powered constantly, but most of the others could only use electricity within a fixed time slot, because the energy needed to be saved.</p> <p>After five years of construction, the life in the base had become much better. The base center was now able to maintain a sufficient water and power supply. In order to resolve the zombie virus infection, every base had built a science lab and gathered some surviving medical scientists to run all sorts of experiment.</p> <p>During the past five years, a large number of zombies were caught for experiments, and some human beings had been sacrificed. But still, no solution was found.</p> <p>However, the experiments continued.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue heated the oil in a wok while washing the vegetables. Then, he expertly cut all the washed vegetables and began to stir-fry them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he said, “I feel that it’s heading South. It has been moving South the whole time, and it picked the shortest path. It would only take a detour when it had to.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong nodded, then said with confusion, “But, my people haven’t found anything. I guess it’s too hard to locate.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and responded, “Of course, it has a space. If anything is wrong, it’ll immediately hide in its space. Can you possibly find it?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong sighed and said, “You have made it sounds magical. I’d really like to meet it myself.”</p> <p>Thinking of that strange zombie, Wu Chengyue maintained the smile on his face, but also showed an interested look. Apparently, he was interested in that zombie. He wanted to see it again and know more about it.</p> <p>In fact, what made him more curious was how the zombie communicated with his daughter.</p> <p>“Ah, I’ve heard that Yang Jianhua, one of the Deputy Chiefs of the Hades Base, was hunting Netherworld Fire’s family. I wonder if he’ll succeed. I heard that he has been after Netherworld Fire’s younger sister. I don’t think he’ll let her go this time,” said Xiao Yunlong abruptly.</p> <p>While making the dinner, Wu Chengyue replied, “Do you know that Yang Jianhua found a way to get close Netherworld Fire only because he wanted her sister? People said that he had saved Netherworld Fire’s life, but that’s not real.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Xiao Yunlong paused slightly, then raised his brows and asked with surprise, “Hmm…? Do you mean that years ago, he didn’t really save Netherworld Fire?”</p> <p>“I only heard about some of it,” said Wu Chengyue. “I heard from Earth Dragon Base people that Yang Jianhua has actually been one of Long Yubai’s bedmates since before the apocalypse. After the old world ended, he followed Netherworld Fire, but still kept in touch with Long Yubai, albeit very secretly. So, what do you think? I heard that it was Long Yubai’s people who made Netherworld Fire get trapped in a zombie city, and created a chance for Yang Jianhua to save her.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong widened his eyes when he heard all that and said in astonishment, “Damn! Are you saying that they had started entrapping Netherworld Fire years ago?”</p> <p>Wu Yuecheng nodded and replied in agreement, “Exactly! I wonder if she had figured it out before she died. I guess she’d be so mad if she knew.”</p> <p>“True that,” sighed Xiao Yunlong, “Eh, you said that Yang Jianhua wants Netherworld Fire’s younger sister, but you also said that he’s Long Yubai’s bedmate… How? Doesn’t he like men?”</p> <p>“Who said that he only likes men?” Wu Chengyue chuckled. “He’s a bisexual.”</p> <p>Picturing Yang Jianhua and Long Yubai rolling in a bed together, Xiao Yunlong shivered. “Eh, he likes both men and women? Can’t imagine!”</p>",
  "Chapter 127: The Grievous News": "<p>The next day, in the place where Li Zheng and his teammates were staying, someone knocked the door early in the morning.</p> <p>“Who came so early?” Lin Yu glanced at the others and asked. While speaking, he walked to the door, preparing to open it.</p> <p>“It might be Sea City Base people,” said Li Zheng, referring to the officers from Sea City Base.</p> <p>Lin Yu opened the door and saw two men in service uniforms standing out there. They had seen one of the two men before, following the Deputy Chief named Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>“Captain Huang? What brought you here? It’s so early in the morning,” Lin Yu said to Xiao Yunlong’s assistant, whose name was Huang Ming.</p> <p>Huang Ming and one of his subordinates stood outside the door, carrying a few bags. Seeing Lin Yu, he smilingly handed him the bag.</p> <p>“We need to talk to you. I suppose you haven’t had breakfast. We got you something from the cafeteria. Eat them while they’re still warm.”</p> <p>Lin Yu smiled and opened the door, taking over the bags as he thanked him, “Thank you! You’ve been too nice to us!”</p> <p>Huang Min walked in, leaving his subordinate waiting outside the door. As he came in, Lin Yu closed the door.</p> <p>Lin Zheng prepared Huang Ming a chair for him to sit down, then asked curiously, “What made you come so early in the morning.”</p> <p>Huang Ming took a seat and then responded, “Ah, you should have breakfast first. I’ll tell you when you’re done. Have you gotten used to living here yet? Is this place too small for the five of you? How about I get you a larger place?”</p> <p>He didn’t answer Li Zheng’s question, but brought up another topic.</p> <p>Lin Yu and Li Zheng glanced at each other. Neither of them knew what Huang Ming wanted to tell them. As Huang Ming insisted on waiting until they finished the breakfast, they decided to do as he said.</p> <p>They opened the breakfast bag. The breakfast comprised of a dozen steamed breads and Baozi; <sup>1</sup>  they were all made from refined flour, and could be counted as luxurious.</p> <p>Each of the five got a steamed bread and a Baozi.</p> <p>Li Cheng took a bite of the Baozi, then replied to Huang Ming with laughter, “Ah, no need, we’re good! This place is nice for us. Lin Yu has made a bed on the floor, which is fine. Worst case scenario, we might step on him when we get up in the night to use the bathroom.”</p> <p>“Haha,” Huang Ming laughed, “You wouldn’t do that on purpose, would you?”</p> <p>“They don’t dare,” Lin Yu said with his mouth stuffed by Baozi, ” I’d crush their d*cks.” While speaking, he realized that when the others stepped over him at night, he could totally make an upward kick to attack their crotch area.</p> <p>“Eh-hem!” Feng Yuming said with a smile, “Brother Lin Yu, so that’s what you thought every time when we stepped over you.”</p> <p>Lin Yu rolled his eyes, then focused on the Baozi. The Baozi was small, so he finished it with two bites and started eating the steamed bread.</p> <p>“No need!” He said to Huang Ming, “We’re just a bunch of men with no special needs. We won’t stay here for long anyway. When our Chief arrives, we’ll still need to move out.”</p> <p>The others all nodded.</p> <p>As they all finished the breakfast and began drinking water, Huang Ming began talking.</p> <p>He stopped smiling and said with a serious look, “I came here today to tell you something about your base. You all know that some people from the Earth Dragon Base had been coveting your base for long. This time, they were about to make a move, so your Chief Netherworld Fire sent you to our base to seek cooperation. However, our Deputy Chief got a message yesterday morning. A couple of days after you left, your Hades Base was broken.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Li Zheng and his teammates all paused and turned to Huang Ming, their faces filled with disbelief.</p> <p>“That’s impossible! Didn’t they say that the Earth Dragon Base will launch the attack in five months? How can they possibly attack right after we left? Besides, our base can’t be broken so easily. Our Chief is so powerful!” Feng Yuming said with an unbelieving look. His eyes were popped in surprise, voice was filled with panic and anxiety.</p> <p>They knew that the Earth Dragon Base had already allied with some other bases and prepared to attack their base. Even their Chief thought that the Hades Base might not be able to survive. That was why she sent them to the Sea City Base to seek cooperation. Their Chief was planning to find a place in Zhe Province to build another base. As the Hades Base had a considerable population, she wanted the Sea City Base to temporarily accommodate some women, children, and other people from Hades Base who weren’t able to fight.</p> <p>Those people didn’t need any fancy place to live. They could even live in sheds. As long as they were protected by the strong wall of a base, they would be fine.</p> <p>In the post-apocalyptic era, every base had a twenty-meterd-tall fence wall that was protecting all its members from the zombies.</p> <p>Therefore, Chief Netherworld Fire was planning to send a part of the Hades Base people into the Sea City Base first, then gather some relatively stronger men to build a temporary base near the Sea City. After that, they would go to the Zhe Province to build their new base.</p> <p>About that, Netherworld Fire had sent her people to negotiate with the three leaders of the Sea City Base. This time, she sent Li Zheng and his teammates to talk to Wu Chengyue to confirm it for the last time, and also to find the place for their temporary base. When the first batch of the Hades Base people arrived, the construction of the new base would begin, and the Sea City Base would send people to help with it. But of course, the Hades Base had promised the Sea City Base a certain amount of supplies as payback.</p> <p>According to the information they got, the Earth Dragon People would only attack in five months from now. Five months was enough to send away most of the Hades Base people.</p> <p>However, Huang Ming was telling them that in just a couple of days after they left, their base has been broken!</p> <p>They had only left their base for about a month. If what Huang Ming said was true, it had already been around twenty days since their base broke. Their Chief and Deputy Chiefs were still guarding the base, so how on earth could it be broken so fast?</p> <p>The others shared the same thought as Feng Yuming. None of them believed Huang Ming.</p> <p>“Calm down!” said Huang Ming, “Things happened for a reason. I assume you don’t know about it yet. Yang Jianhua, one of your two Deputy Chiefs, is actually a mole from the Earth Dragon Base. He gave the information about your base and our base to the Earth Dragon Base people, then lied to your Chief that the Earth Dragon people will attack in five months. That’s why things became like this.”</p> <p>“That’s impossible!” The five said in one voice as Huang Ming finished talking.</p>",
  "Chapter 128: Aid Action": "<p>“How can it be our Deputy Chief!” Li Zheng said heatedly, “It can’t possibly be Deputy Chief Yang! Everyone in the Hades Base knows that he has saved our Chief’s life! Chief treats him better than her own brother! How can he be a mole from the Earth Dragon Base!”</p> <p>“It can’t be, can’t be! Captain is right! How can it be Deputy Chief Yang? He’s like Chief’s brother! He’s nice to Chief Netherworld Fire as well! How can he possibly hurt Chief?” Lin Yu said while shaking his head. He wore the same look as the others.</p> <p>Looked at their stunned faces, Huang Ming sighed and said, “Did your Deputy Chief Yang tell your Chief that Long Yubai had only allied with the Sky Fire Base to attack your base? In five months? Do you know how many people attacked your base about half a month ago? Apart from the Earth Dragon Base and Sky Fire Base people, Hidden Cloud Base people showed up as well. Including long Yubai, five level-seven powerful beings joined the attack. Apart from all these, Yang Jianhua has also put some drug in Chief Netherworld Fire’s water to suppress her power.”</p> <p>The five popped their eyes in shock. They didn’t dare to believe Huang Ming’s words. However, they clearly understood that as a right-hand man of a Deputy Chief, Huang Ming had no reason to lie to them. It must be his leader who sent him to say these words to them.</p> <p>As the five remained silent, Huang Ming continued patiently, “I know this is hard for you, and you all don’t want to believe it. But, this news has been verified by us. I believe you’ll get the message from your people soon. I have two other news for you, one good and one bad. Which one do you like to hear first?”</p> <p>“The good one!”</p> <p>“The bad news!”</p> <p>The five spoke out simultaneously, but made different choices.</p> <p>Li Zheng glanced at the others, making them quiet down immediately. After that, he said to Huang Ming, “Tell us the bad news first then. We’ve already known the worst anyway. What can be worse than the destruction of our base?”</p> <p>Huang Ming nodded and said, “As I mentioned before, the Earth Dragon Base had sent five level-seven superpowered people to attack your base. So, your Chief was besieged. Under that kind of situation, she failed to control her power well, and burned down a big half of your base. Many people died. After that, she was forced to Wan City by the seaside. She detonated her energy nucleus on a cliff. I heard that two of the five level-seven were injured severely, and one died. But, that information still needs to be verified. We’ve only heard that Netherworld Fire has blown herself up, but no one witnessed it. By now, we and the other bases have all sent out people to look at the spot where she did that.”</p> <p>After hearing that sad news, Li Zheng and his teammates couldn’t say a word.</p> <p>Their leader was murdered by five level-seven powerful beings, dying in a siege. What did that mean? Did Long Yubai gather all the leaders of the three bases?</p> <p>Five against one…Even though Chief Netherworld Fire was strong, she couldn’t possibly win in such a scenario. Therefore, it was reasonable for her to detonate her energy nucleus and die together with one enemy.</p> <p>“Impossible! That’s impossible! Even if our Chief can’t win, she’d be able to run. Her power is so special and strong. Not even five level-seven can kill her easily! How can she possibly choose to blow herself up? If she died, what would Great Captain and her other family members do?” Lin Yu murmured expressionlessly.</p> <p>“You’re right! Chief can’t die! She wouldn’t leave her family like that!” Li Zheng’s eyes glowed as he said with hope.</p> <p>“And there’s the good news,” said Huang Ming, “Because of the efforts your Chief made, her family managed to escape. But now, they’re still hunted by Yang Jianhua. As far as we know, they’ve entered the Min Province, but we haven’t figured out what happened to them next.”</p> <p>“Chief’s family escaped? But, why would Deputy Chief Yang hunt them? How can he do that?” Li Zheng looked at him and asked.</p> <p>The five refused to believe that Yang Jianhua was hunting their Chief’s family, because their Chief and her family treated him like one of their own, and it would be inhumane for him to try hurting them.</p> <p>“Whether you believe it or not, our information is real,” said Huang Ming, “Our Chief is preparing to send some people to aid Lin Feng and his family. He sent me here to tell you about what happened, and also to ask you if you’d like to go help Lin Feng and his people. After all, they’re in a bad situation now.”</p> <p>“We’ll go!”</p> <p>“We’ll all go!”</p> <p>“Yeah, we must help them!”</p> <p>“I’ll go find out if it’s really Yang Jianhua who did it!”</p> <p>Once Huang Ming finished talking, the five responded promptly. They didn’t want to believe what Huang Ming said, so they needed to see if it was real with their own eyes.</p> <p>Huang Ming nodded and said, “Alright, we’ll leave this afternoon. I’ll be leading the team this time. Our people might be no match for Yang Jianhua, but we can deal with his soldiers. With you, our team will grow stronger.”</p> <p>Huang Ming had level-five ice power. His power was strong, so Xiao Yunsong sent him to lead tens of elite soldiers to aid Lin Feng and his family.</p> <p>Li Zheng was also a level-five, so his participation would surely strengthen the team.</p> <p>“I still don’t believe that our Chief is dead. She won’t die. We’re not only going to pick up Great Captain and his people. We’re also going to the place where Chief blew herself up and take a look.” said Li Zheng.</p> <p>“Yeah!” the others nodded in agreement.</p> <p>“What happened to our other Deputy Chief?” Feng Yuming asked abruptly.</p> <p>Huang Ming responded, “Do you mean your Deputy Chief Yuan? He has been missing for nearly a month. No one knows if he’s still alive. But, according to the message we’ve got, he went missing before the Earth Dragon Base people attacked, about the same time when you left.”</p> <p>The others glanced at each other with surprise. “Do you mean Deputy Chief Yuan went missing when we left the base? Why?” Li Zheng asked.</p> <p>Huang Ming shook his head and replied, “We don’t know. But, since that moment, we haven’t heard anything about him. Maybe you can try to figure that out yourself. Or, the truth will naturally come to you if he shows up.”</p> <p>The others had no choice but to nod in agreement. They guessed that there were still things that they didn’t know yet. Otherwise, why would their Deputy Chief disappear for no reason? Normally, he wouldn’t let anything happen to Chief even if he needed to give up his own life.</p> <p>After all, Chief Netherworld Fire was so important to him.</p>",
  "Chapter 129: The Man With An Unrequited Love": "<p>At the moment, Yuan Tianxing, who had fallen in love with Netherworld Fire, was in despair. He couldn’t have thought that Yang Jianhua was an ungrateful soul who had colluded with Earth Dragon Base People and betrayed Hades Base.</p> <p>Back in that day, after he secretly sent Lin Yu and his teammates away, he accidentally found that Yang Jianhua sneakily left the base alone, heading to another direction. He didn’t feel right about Yang Jianhua being outside the base alone.</p> <p>At that time, everyone knew that the Earth Dragon Base was preparing to attack the Hades Base, and was on the alert. Who would leave the base alone? Not to mention the fact that Yang Jianhua was one of the Deputy Chiefs of the base.</p> <p>But of course, Yuan Tianxing was outside the base alone as well. However, he had a good reason for it, as he was out there to escort the Chief’s subordinates who were leaving for a mission. But what about Yang Jianhua?</p> <p>He never liked Yang Jianhua because he was jealous of the latter, also because of the latter’s attitude.</p> <p>Yuan Tianting was jealous of Yang Jianhua because Netherworld Fire cared so much about him. She treated him so nicely, and had always been protecting him. Yang Jianhua wasn’t her little brother, yet she treated him better than her little brother, only because he had saved her life. As a man who had secretly loved her for years, Yuan Tianxing saw Yang Jianhua as a pain in the a*s, let alone the fact that Yang Jianhua had been using the protection provided by Netherworld Fire and her family to build his own force. Netherworld Fire turned a blind eye to what he had done, and even found excuses for him.</p> <p>Therefore, on finding Yang Jianhua outside the base alone suspiciously, Yuan Tianxing immediately decided to follow him to figure out what he had been up to.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, he saw Yang Jianhua meeting with Long Yubai, the leader of the Earth Dragon Base. As a Deputy Chief of the Hades base, why on earth would he meet with the leader of his enemies alone?</p> <p>Back at that time, Yuan Tianxing felt that things weren’t right. So, he crept up on them to try and find out what exactly was happening. As a result, he was stunned when he witnessed the intimate movements between them.</p> <p>What the hell? Why was the other Deputy Chief of his base kissing the leader of his enemies? And, both of them were men!</p> <p>Two men kissing each other was a common thing in the post-apocalyptic era, but the two of them were supposed to be enemies. When did they hook up?</p> <p>Before Yuan Tianxing could figure out a thing, Long Yubai who was at level-seven, discovered him. After that, a fight was started. Yuan Tianxing was at level-six, and so was Yang Jianhua. Facing a level-seven, a level-six, and three level-five humans, he surely had no chance of winning.</p> <p>Therefore, he got caught. He was missing, because he was kept in a secret place by his enemies.</p> <p>Fortunately, Yang Jianhua didn’t know that he had a secret weapon. After being kept for about half a month, Yuan Tianxing escaped.</p> <p>However, it was already too late for him to do anything. Once he got out, he heard that the Hades Base was broken, and his Chief blew herself up and died together with one of the enemies. Only Chief’s family managed to escape.</p> <p>Netherworld Fire’s death hit Yuan Tianxing substantially. The woman he loved was dead, so his heart was broken. However, as a mature man, he soon put himself back together after the grief. He got through it, then heard that Netherworld Fire managed to send her family away, who were still being hunted by Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>The injured Yuan Tianxing planned to help Lin Feng and his families, and take revenge on Yang Jianhua. Yang Jianhua and Bai Yulong hurt him and locked him up, also killing the women he loved. So, he had to take revenge.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing decided to find Lin Feng and his family first, then plan for the next step.</p> <p>Therefore, after escaping from where he was kept by Yang Jianhua, he began looking for Lin Feng and his people according to the information he had collected. Days later, he arrived at the Min Province.</p> <p>At the same time, Lin Qiao, who had traveled for three days under Long Qingying’s guidance, had caught up with some people.</p> <p>She had returned to Zhe Province already. The ones she found weren’t Lin Feng and his family, but were Yang Jianhua’s troops. Both Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili were high-level zombies, especially the latter, who was a powerful level-six red-eyed zombie. Therefore, their journey had been unimpeded as always.</p> <p>Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing didn’t even know why Qiu Lili had red eyes, because they hadn’t heard anything about red-eyed zombies. In fact, all Level-six zombies had red eyes. People rarely knew about this as all who had encountered level-six zombies ended up dead. Therefore, both Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying thought that Qiu Lili’s red eyes were caused by mutation.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and the others stood on the roof of a ten-story building, looking at the place hundreds of meters away.</p> <p>“They stopped there. It seems that they have lost track of Great Captain and his people again.” Du Yuanxing looked at that direction and said. In that area, a few heavy off-road vehicles were parked on a square. After the surrounding zombies were swept off by the weapons placed on the vehicles, the people in the car came out one after another.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying stood together while Ling Qiao, Qiu Lili, and Junjun, who carried the little boy, were standing on the other side. The two human beings automatically kept a distance of two meters from the three zombies.</p> <p>These couple of days, Lin Qiao had been letting Junjun and the little boy out of her space to breathe fresh air, as it’d be boring for them to stay in the space the whole time. At first, Junjun was scared of Qiu Lili, as she knew that the latter was able to control her. But later on, she stopped worrying because she discovered that Qiu Lili was quite obedient to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao focused her ear toward the few vehicles, but failed to hear any conversations. She had caught up with these vehicles this afternoon. Finding these vehicles meant that she had chosen the right direction, and that Lin Feng and his people were also heading this way.</p> <p>However, after following these vehicles for a day, she didn’t see Yang Jianhua, who was mentioned by Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>During the past few days, as long as Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying mentioned Chief Netherworld Fire, she would listen very carefully to their conversations.</p> <p>She felt very weird about a person who shared the same name with her but had a different life and experiences. However, the names of their family members were the same, and that made her feel even more confused.</p> <p>So now, she wanted to see her family as soon as possible. She wanted to know if they were the same as she remembered. If they were truly her family, she would have to find out the truth about the other Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying while pointing at that direction, then put a hand on Junjun’s shoulder and sent her into the space. As she came out, she turned and leaped directly onto another building, then moved toward the few vehicles.</p> <p>Qiu Lili darted out as well, following behind Lin Qiao.</p>",
  "Chapter 130: The Scent Of Family": "<p>Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying silently watched Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili leaping across the building roofs. As human beings, they were only able to run down this building with their legs.</p> <p>As the two human beings ran downstairs, Lin Qiao had already approached the square. She stopped on top of a building next to the square and switched into the invisible state. After that, she leaped down the building and moved toward the few vehicles.</p> <p>After all the zombies on the square were cleaned, the people in the vehicles got out and formed small groups, moving toward the surrounding corners.</p> <p>“Eh, I just have to pee. Finally…”</p> <p>“Same here…”</p> <p>“We’ll be entering Sea City if we don’t make a move now. I wonder what Chief Yang is thinking. Why do we have to catch them alive? Why don’t simply kill them all?”</p> <p>“What do you know? In fact, he doesn’t really want Lin Feng and his family to die. Perhaps, those people are still useful.”</p> <p>“For what purpose? Does he want them to live only because they treated him well before?”</p> <p>“Em, stop talking nonsense. He has a reason to do what he’s been doing. Let’s just quietly take a leak and then get back. Hurry up!”</p> <p>Hearing the conversations between these people who had formed groups to pee, Lin Qiao finally understood why Yang Jianhua had been chasing her family all this time. It turned out that he wanted to catch them alive.</p> <p>But, why?</p> <p>She couldn’t figure it out, so she silently turned back to move to the vehicles. She chose the car in the middle, then stepped on the bumper and quietly climbed onto the car roof.</p> <p>Then, she lied down and pressed her ear on the air vent to hear the sounds inside the car.</p> <p>“Have you located them?”</p> <p>“Sir, we have. They’re in a warehouse two miles ahead.”</p> <p>“Don’t get too close. Lin Hao has sharp sensations. He can discover us very easily. Stay five-hundred meters away from them, and from all the trees.”</p> <p>“Yes, Sir!”</p> <p>“It’s about the time to make a move. Lin Feng has been injured severely. Without him, I doubt they can run away from me again.”</p> <p>The sounds from inside the car were weak, but Lin Qiao still grasped them.</p> <p>She knitted her brows. A man said that Lin Feng had been injured severely. Judging by his tone, this man should be Yang Jianhua. Somehow, Lin Qiao felt that his voice was familiar.</p> <p>She guessed that she had misheard. She didn’t know Yang Jianhua, so how could she find his voice familiar?</p> <p>By that time, the people who went out to pee had all returned to the car.</p> <p>Boom! Boom!</p> <p>The car doors were closed. Two minutes later, the car on the left was started, driving forward. Lin Qiao hurriedly stood up and ran for two steps, then nimbly leaped onto that car.</p> <p>After that, the car which she heard Yang Jianhua’s voice from was started as well.</p> <p>Next, all the other vehicles also began moving. But soon, Lin Qiao found that these cars were moving in different directions. She leaped down the car, then ran up and stepped onto a tree nearby. After that, she hopped onto the nearest building.</p> <p>She wasn’t able to jump over ten meters high, but a few meters was easy for her.</p> <p>She leaped onto the third floor of the building in front of her, then popped her claws to catch hold of the wall. Next, she climbed up quickly like a monkey through all the areas with handholds.</p> <p>She soon climbed onto the roof, then stood on the tallest spot to observe the routes of the few vehicles. A while later, she found that the car in the middle had been slowly moving forward, while all the other vehicles had taken detours. However, these cars were heading toward the same destination.</p> <p>She sniffed the air and soon sensed a few faint human scents from that direction. This meant that Lin Feng and his family were right in that area.<br/>\nLin Qiao was sure about it because the human scents she sensed were very, very familiar to her.</p> <p>She never paid attention to the scents of her family, maybe because she had gotten used to them or her sense of smell wasn’t as sharp as today. However, she had still memorized the scents of her family.</p> <p>As she had become a zombie and her sense of smell had grown hundreds of times sharper than before, those scents were now much more obvious to her.</p> <p>She not only found those scents familiar, but had also detected some other things from them; she grasped a sense of belonging.</p> <p>‘Family!’</p> <p>Suddenly, this word emerged in her mind.</p> <p>Under her sunglasses, her eyes glowed with a green light. All of a sudden, her pupils turned green, and the green light shone out directly through the sunglasses.</p> <p>If anyone were standing right in front of her at the moment, they would be able to see her faintly green eyes through those sunglasses.</p> <p>Lin Qiao got a little excited as she immediately leaped toward the source of the human scents from the building roof.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the warehouse which was targeted by Yang Jianhua and Lin Qiao, Lin Feng was lying in a corner. The little girl and the baby-faced Cheng Wangxue squatted by his side anxiously while the others were standing aside, looking at him with grim expressions.</p> <p>Lin Hao and a few slightly injured soldiers guarded in the surroundings, with their backs toward Lin Feng. While focusing on the surrounding environment, they turned back to glance at Lin Feng from time to time with worry.</p> <p>“Daddy! Daddy! How’re you doing! Daddy! Don’t die!” The little girl put her face on Lin Feng’s chest and said to him while crying.</p> <p>Lin Feng couldn’t move, but his mind was still clear. He forced a smile on his face and comforted his daughter, “Xiaolu, it’s alright! Daddy won’t leave you… Eh-hem… pah!”</p> <p>However, he coughed before finishing his words; his face paled as he coughed out a mouthful of blood.</p> <p>The others were all frightened.</p> <p>“Lin Feng, stop talking!”</p> <p>“Daddy!” Lin Xiaolu couldn’t help but cry out loud.</p> <p>Cheng Wangyue had tears on her face as well, yet her eyes were showing determination. She held Lin Feng’s hand and said through clenched teeth, “I will certainly kill that b*stard. He has fooled us for so long! I’ve been lying to us all these years! I’m gonna kill him! I’m definitely gonna kill him!”</p> <p>“Wangxue, calm down! Lin Feng was too angry, which was why Yang Jianhua got a chance to hurt him. You can’t be injured as well! We’re almost arriving at Sea City, and the reinforcements will show up very soon! As long as Lin Feng makes it to the Sea City Base, he’ll be safe!” Lin Wenwen put her arms around Cheng Wangxue’s shoulders as she was worried that the latter might rush out alone.</p>",
  "Chapter 131: The Injured Lin Feng": "<p>“Unacceptable! That’s unacceptable! How could he…How could he lie to us! What’s worse, he lied to Qiao!” Mrs. Lin was in her fifties, but was still pretty. Her eyes were red right now. While wiping her tears, she was looking at her son with sadness in her eyes and cursing Yang Jianhua through gritted teeth.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen was wearing a calm look. She sighed expressionlessly and said, “But, my sister doesn’t know about it yet! Well, that’s better though. Otherwise, I can’t imagine how sad she’d be.”</p> <p>“You’re right! Thank god Qiao doesn’t know. But she’s…” Mrs. Lin was choked with sobs again.</p> <p>“I…I’m fine…Don’t worry about me…” said Lin Feng. After letting out a mouthful of blood, he actually felt much better.</p> <p>Once he finished his words, Lin Hao, who had been standing aside on full alert, had his expression changed. “They’re here!” He said vigilantly, “We can’t stay here! Let’s go, now!” While speaking, he immediately turned back and ran up to Lin Feng. Hearing his words, the others all became nervous.</p> <p>Lin Hao ran up to Lin Feng, then squatted with his back toward him. Lin Wenwen and Cheng Wangyue immediately helped Lin Feng up and put him on Lin Hao’s back.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin instantly scooped Lin Xiaolu and followed the others toward the outside. The last five soldiers raised their guns and carefully went out before the Lin Family.</p> <p>After wiping out all the ordinary zombies outside the door, they turned to signal for Lin Hao and the others to come out. After that, Lin Wenwen, Cheng Wangxue, and the others surrounded Lin Hao, who was carrying Lin Feng, and Mrs. Lin, who was holding the little girl, in order to protect them.</p> <p>Then, they left quickly.</p> <p>However, before they could have gone far, a heavily armed military vehicle blocked their way.</p> <p>As all the weapons on the car were pointed at them, they had no choice but to stop moving. Seeing that car, they didn’t show despair in their eyes, but an extremely strong anger and hatred. The intent of killing radiating from their bodies instantly grew stronger.</p> <p>They fixed their eyes on the car, hoping that they could have a bomb to blow it up.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Following the noise, a man landed on the car roof, then stood straight with his hands behind his back.</p> <p>This man was in a well-ironed military uniform, hands covered in white gloves. A sword was carried on his leather belt. He had a nice body shape, over six feet tall, with long and slender legs.</p> <p>He looked sharp, with a pair of long and narrowed eyes, thick slanting brows, straight nose, and thin lips. He was a nice-looking man, around thirty years old.</p> <p>At the moment, he had raised his chin slightly and narrowed his eyes. With a faint smile, he was looking down at Lin Hao and his family who seemed to be in an awful situation.</p> <p>“Lin Feng, you don’t look good. I wonder how long you can live. I got some drugs which might be able to save your life.” He looked at Lin Feng while smiling and said.</p> <p>Lin Feng was lying prone on his brother’s back, his head dropped. He didn’t see the man’s face, but gave a deep sneer.</p> <p>“No need. We won’t accept the kindness of a liar. Not to mention the fake kindness from the man who did this to us,” he said.</p> <p>After Lin Feng said that, Lin Hao stared at that man with coldness and said, “Yang Jianhua, you know clearly how we treated you in the past few years. Watch out for karma.”</p> <p>He didn’t raise his head, but upturned his eyes to stare at the man fiercely.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua who stood on the car roof smiled and responded with, “You’re right! See how grateful I am to you all. That’s exactly the reason why I didn’t kill you. Otherwise, do you think you could have survived until now?”</p> <p>While he was speaking, the other vehicles showed up in all directions, blocking all the possible paths for Lin Feng and his family. A series of gunshots were heard as the soldiers in the cars killed all the zombies that had been approaching.</p> <p>Soon, a zombie-free area was created around Lin Feng and his family.</p> <p>“Yang Jianhua! Liar! You won’t live for long! Do you really think that Long Yubai will give you the Hades Base? Wake up! You’re gonna suffer for what you’ve done sooner or later!” Lin Wenwen’s calm look disappeared as she stared at Yang Jianhua and yelled at him, her face twisted in anger.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua gently looked at Lin Wenwen, his face showing a tender smile. “Wenwen, stop being childish. Come back with me. From now on, I’m a base leader. Be my woman, and you’ll have a half of the base, won’t you? Why don’t you do as I say?”</p> <p>He was wearing a nice smile, but he sounded like someone who was trying to lure a misbehaved pet back to him. Hearing his words, Lin Wenwen shivered and had all her fine hairs standing straight up.</p> <p>She uttered a scream, then burst in yells, “Eh! Yang Jianhua! Don’t you dare talk to me like that! I’m telling you this, I’d rather die than be with someone as disgusting as you!”</p> <p>This time, Yang Jianhua didn’t say another word. He stopped smiling and showed a bland look. However, he still had something in his eyes as he stared at Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>After that scream, Lin Wenwen seemed to have woken up from that strangely calm and dull state.</p> <p>As same as Lin Hao, she glared at Yang Jianhua fiercely, looking like a brutal female wolf. Her eyes were popped and cheeks were bulged, meaning that she was clenching her teeth tight.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao was standing on top of the three-story building which was next to Lin Hao and his family.</p> <p>As she fixed her eyes on Yang Jianhua, she felt that her brain was even twitching, as if something was coming back to her mind. However, some other things stopped that from happening.</p> <p>She looked at Yang Jianhua’s handsome face, then turned to her family.</p> <p>That was right! She saw her mother, brothers and sister, even her niece. Those were all her family indeed!</p> <p>But…But, why did she feel that they were all different from before?</p> <p>Soon, she figured it out. Her family had already been through five years after the apocalypse. In her memories, her niece was a two-year-old baby, but now, she had become a little girl.</p> <p>Time! That was what made them seem different than before!</p> <p>Lin Qiao was so excited on seeing her families that she almost showed her face and dove down. However, her mind stopped her from doing that, making her stay on the nearest building to watch while calming down.</p> <p>If she showed up with her zombie face, she would frighten them, and they might even attack her.</p> <p>She was also thinking that if her family were also Netherworld Fire’s family, she and Netherworld Fire would be the same person. But, why did she become a zombie? Why didn’t she remember anything that happened in the past five years? Had she forgotten it all?</p> <p>How could she possibly forget all that had happened in the past five years? What exactly had happened?</p>",
  "Chapter 132: Do You Even Have Sense Of Shame?": "<p>After confirming that those people were really her family members, Lin Qiao’s head was again filled with puzzles. But soon, she temporarily forgot about all the questions she had, as the current situation was truly not good.</p> <p>She had no idea why her head ached once she saw the man named Yang Jianhua. However, he knew that this man who had been greedily staring at her sister wasn’t a good guy.</p> <p><em>‘How dare you hurt my family! You should die!’ </em> Lin Qiao cleared her mind and released her vibe. A fierce intent of killing radiated from her body.</p> <p>The expressionless Yang Jianhua was going to say something to Lin Wenwen, but his head suddenly turned to where Lin Qiao was, his charming eyes glowing with a cold light.</p> <p>“Eh?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao automatically moved her feet. But after that, she realized that she didn’t need to do it. She was invisible now, so how could that man possibly see her?</p> <p>She felt silly, but also learned that Yang Jianhua had very sharp sensations. She only released her intention of killing for a moment, yet he had grasped it. It seemed that he was rather powerful.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua glanced at the roof of that building with confusion. Just now, he had suddenly sensed an intention of killing from that area, but nothing else.</p> <p>Was his feeling wrong?</p> <p>While thinking, he focused his sensations toward that building roof, but still detected nothing. After that, he gave up and turned back to Lin Wenwen and the others.</p> <p>His movements caught the attention of Lin Hao and his family as well. They didn’t know why he looked at the building next to them, but judging by his expression, he had found something which he couldn’t explain.</p> <p>However, the Lin Family didn’t notice Lin Qiao’s vibe, as they had been paying all their attention to Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua looked at Lin Wenwen and said blandly, “Wenwen, are you going to make me force you? It’s alright, I’ll…fulfill your wish!”</p> <p>While speaking, he suddenly raised his hands from behind his body, swinging toward Lin Feng. An ice blade was created in the air, flying fleetingly toward Lin Feng and Lin Hao.</p> <p>As Yang Jianhua launched an attack before even finishing talking, Lin Hao automatically stepped backward. Cheng Wangxue stepped up and made a side flip, followed by a neat roundhouse kick.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>She accurately shattered the ice blade with her foot. However, as she took her foot back, her expression started looking strange. Lin Wenwen immediately supported her, worriedly looking at her foot as she said with a low voice, “Wangxue, your foot!”</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue frowned slightly and shook her head to Lin Wenwen, remained silent. But, everyone knew that her foot was injured.</p> <p>Lin Feng raised his head and glanced at Cheng Wangxue, who was his wife, then finally looked at Yang Jianhua and said coldly, “You didn’t only lie to us, you also get Qiao killed. The whole base knows how she treated you. Anyone with a conscience wouldn’t do what you’ve done. Where’s your conscience?”</p> <p>The others all looked at Yang Jianhua coldly as well.</p> <p>After hearing Lin Feng’s words, Yang Jianhua calmly looked at him and replied, “She treated me the way I deserved because I saved her life, right?”</p> <p>He wanted the others to believe that he earned a high position in the base because he deserved it, and Lin Qiao treated him well because she needed to pay him back for saving her life.</p> <p>“Bullsh*t!” Lin Wenwen cursed wrathfully. “If you and Long Yubai didn’t entrap my sister together, how could she possibly be trapped in that zombie city for half a month without any food or water? Without your fake information, she would have been able to free herself from that city long before you were there! It was all you! You pretended to save her! You said that yourself! How dare you think that you deserve all that we had given you! Do you even have a sense of shame?”</p> <p>Her face blushed because of anger and eyes bulged. She was trembling slightly, her fists clenched.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua looked at the furious Lin Wenwen and abruptly laughed out loud, “Haha…Yeah, I said that. I planned the whole thing. But, so what? Have you ever thought that if it weren’t for me, Lin Qiao would have been dead over four years ago? I allowed her to live for a few extra years. I was going to convince her to join Long Yubai’s team, then build the Earth Dragon Base together, but she refused! Why? If she had listened to me, the Earth Dragon Base would be twice as large by now. Perhaps, she would become a Deputy Chief like me, and I’d be running the entire base together with Long Yubai. Wouldn’t that be nice?”</p> <p>While speaking, Yang Jianhua turned a little emotional as well. He reached his hands forward while staring at Lin Wenwen with glowing eyes.</p> <p>“Em, you do have some ambition. Under the chaotic circumstances, you were already thinking about building a base and making yourself the chief.” The sadness in Mrs. Lin’s face was gone as she coldly glared at Yang Jianhua and said.</p> <p>“Fortunately, my sister was wise enough to not build the base together with you. Otherwise, you and Long Yubai would have found a way to murder my whole family, including my sister, long ago!” Said Lin Hao.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua paused slightly, then the look on his face turned cold.</p> <p>Seeing his expression, the others immediately figured out that Lin Hao was right. Yang Jianhua planned to murder Lin Qiao long ago. He changed his plan and followed Lin Qiao only because the latter refused to build a base together with Long Yubai.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua gazed at Lin Hao with a grim look and said, “I’ve been suspecting if you can sense the others’ thoughts. It’s too dangerous for me to let someone like you live. If you’re able to know everything, how can I keep any secrets?”</p> <p>While speaking, he turned his palms down and pressed in the air.</p> <p>After that, an icy white mist emerged before him in the midair, then a series of sharp icicles appeared, reflecting the eye-piercing sunshine.</p> <p>After creating a great number of icicles, Yang Jianhua didn’t say anything, but suddenly swung his arms and crossed them toward Lin Feng and his family. In the next moment, the icicles before him darted at Lin Feng and his family like shreds of bright light beams.</p> <p>At that moment, no one on Lin Feng’s side was able to stop those icicles. The icicles were moving so fast, coming at Lin Feng and the others within a blink.</p> <p>Before they could realize what was happening, these icicles were already before their eyes.</p>",
  "Chapter 133: Critical Moment": "<p>At that very moment, Lin Feng, who was lying weakly on Lin Hao’s back, suddenly straightened his back and reached out his hands. Next, a strong flame emerged before him and his family.</p> <p>The flame formed a semicircle, timely shielding all of them from those icicles. However, the icicles which were stopped by the flame didn’t melt, sticking onto the flame and trying to pierce through to hurt Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>Lin Feng’s face was paled. He clenched his teeth and kept his hands raised. He knew that he couldn’t hold off the icicles for long, but he just didn’t want to give up now. He knew that once he dropped his hands, all those icicles would pierce into his family’s bodies.</p> <p>“Step… back!” He gritted his teeth and said two words to Lin Hao.</p> <p>Hearing him, Lin Hao and the others slowly drew back. Lin Feng’s flame shield didn’t move along with them, but seemed to move forward against the icicles. Gradually, the distance between them and the flame shield grew longer and longer.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao was anxiously communicating with Qiu Lili, begging her to help in dealing with Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua had level-six ice power. He was not a newly promoted level-six, but was at the peak of that level, just a breath away from level-seven.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wasn’t able to defeat him with her current power. Perhaps, she could stall him for about a minute, but saving her family from Yang Jianhua and the people in the other few vehicles was way too difficult for her.</p> <p>Therefore, she asked Qiu Lili for help. Qiu Lili was a level-six zombie queen, while Yang Jianhua was a level-six superpowered human being. Regarding powers, Yang Jianhua should be no match for Qiu Lili.</p> <p>However, Yang Jianhua was more experienced than Qiu Lili, so Lin Qiao estimated that the first fight between her and Yang Jianhua would end in a draw.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to bring her family into her space, but she could only bring one person at one time. Therefore, she needed time, and also needed to destroy the weapons placed on the few vehicles first.</p> <p>Only after that could she bring Lin Feng and the others away.</p> <p>At the moment, Lin Qiao was in her space, observing the outside situation while writing notes for Qiu Lili who stood beside her.</p> <p>‘The people out there are all my family. I need to save them, but I’m no match for that level-six human being. You’re the only one who can save them. You need to help me. If you don’t help me, why are you staying by my side?’</p> <p>Qiu Lili wasn’t willing to fight Yang Jianhua. However, on seeing Lin Qiao’s anxious face, she hesitated. She looked around, as it was the first time for Lin Qiao to bring her into the space.</p> <p>Once in, she began to like the way this place made her feel.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked straight at Qiu Lili’s pretty red eyes. Maybe because she was emotional or anxious, her pupils had turned green again, and the green light of her eyes shone out through her sunglasses.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was able to see the color of Qiu Lili’s eyes, because those eyes were filled with energy. What Lin Qiao saw from Qiu Lili’s eyes was actually red energy which was emitted from her body.</p> <p>Qiu Lili couldn’t see the color which was showing up in Lin Qiao’s eyes right now. However, she saw a faintly pale pair of pupils through Lin Qiao’s sunglasses.</p> <p>Sensing that Lin Qiao was really worried, she thought for a moment and then nodded. But after that, she gave a roar.<br/>\n“Ah-er-er!”<br/>\n‘I want to stay here.’ she said.</p> <p>While roaring, she pointed at the ground and looked at Lin Qiao, who hurriedly nodded without thinking. As long as Qiu Lili helped her, she would let her do anything she wanted.</p> <p>As Qiu Lili agreed to help, she brought her out of the space immediately, because she sensed that the condition of Lin Feng has changed.</p> <p>A second before Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili came out of the space, Yang Jianhua suddenly moved his hands. Then, Lin Feng popped his eyes and couldn’t help but let out a large mouthful of blood.</p> <p>“Pah!”</p> <p>After that, he dropped his hands and tilted his head, passing out on Lin Hao’s back.</p> <p>“Brother!” Lin Hao shouted.</p> <p>The moment Lin Feng dropped his hands, the flame shield before him and his people was gone, and the icicles flew at them at once.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili were out of the space right at that moment. Seeing Lin Feng vomit blood and the flame shield break, she darted straight at her family without thinking.</p> <p>At the same time, Qiu Lili moved as well. She flew at Yang Jianhua, raised her hands, and brought up a strong gust of wind which surrounded the armed vehicle that Yang Janhua was standing on.</p> <p>“Ah!” She uttered a scream, and her voice traveled a long way, heard by all the surrounding zombies. The zombies paused simultaneously, then slowly turned their heads toward Qiu Lili. Their scary-looking zombie faces were all wearing a confused look. Soon, they all moved their feet and began shambling toward her.</p> <p>All the zombies nearby seemed to be summoned by Qiu Lili as they started moving toward her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao directly leaped down the building when she saw her family in danger. However, she was still too slow. After all, she was at a rather long distance from them, while Yang Jianhua was merely about ten meters away from them.</p> <p>Seeing the sharp icicles coming at them, Lin Wenwen, Cheng Wangxue and the five soldiers automatically shielded Lin Hao, Lin Feng, Mrs. Lin and Lin Xiaolu with their bodies.</p> <p>As they were about to be hurt, Lin Qiao was so anxious. At that very moment, a few people darted out from the surrounding.</p> <p>The earth under the feet of the Lin Family people moved suddenly and then sank, turning into a deep hole. The Lin Family and the five soldiers all fell in and disappeared.</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>“Ah!!” Mrs. Lin and Lin Xiaolu’s screams were heard.</p> <p>The icicles fell onto the ground and caused a series of puffing noise. A few figures showed up around that suddenly appeared hole, almost simultaneously.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Yang Jianhua was startled by Qiu Lili’s scream. Before he could realize what was happening, he saw a shadowy white figure pouncing on him and felt a weird gust of wind surrounding the vehicle under his feet.</p>",
  "Chapter 134: Save Them Together": "<p><em>‘Eh?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao too came over to the giant hole, face filled with confusion. She nearly took off her sunglasses subconsciously. But fortunately, she then came back to her senses and stopped herself from doing that, only leaning her head forward to look into the hole.</p> <p>“Great Captain!…Eh? Deputy Chief Yuan!” Du Yuanxing, who arrived at the edge of the hole a little later than the others, glanced down into the hole and called Lin Feng. After that, he suddenly saw a man standing in front of him. He fixed his eyes on that man, and then burst in shouts with joy.</p> <p>“Wenwen!” Long Qingying also gave a shout when rushing out. Then, she looked into the hole and found that even though it was about two meters deep, the people in it were all fine. The few ladies were sitting on the ground as they didn’t manage to keep their balance when the ground suddenly sank.</p> <p>“It’s Tianxing!” The people in the bottom of the hole all raised their heads, wondering what had happened. Mrs. Lin saw a man first, then shouted with surprise.</p> <p>“Qingying! It’s you!” At that moment, Lin Wenwen saw Long Qingying.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao leaped down into the hole. Once she jumped in, the people in the hole immediately stared at her with vigilance.</p> <p>“Who’re you?” Seeing a man wearing a pair of sunglasses jumping down, Lin Wenwen asked instantly.</p> <p>“Ah, he is…Eh? We don’t know your name yet!” Du Yuanxing tried to explain for Lin Qiao, but suddenly realized that the zombie hadn’t introduced himself yet! Lin Qiao stood in front of her family and looked at Lin Feng with worry. After hearing Du Yuanxing’s words, she only glanced at him, but didn’t respond.</p> <p>After that, both Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing jumped into the hole, and so did the other man. Lin Qiao glanced at him; she recognized this man, even though he had changed a lot.</p> <p>He was Yuan Tianxing. Lin Qiao didn’t think that he would show up in this place.</p> <p>He was an upstanding man, about six feet and three inches tall, with an obvious military presence. He looked as strong and sharp as Lin Feng, yet he had a handsome face. His slanted eyes were rather charming, somehow attractive. His nose was straight, lips thin and beautifully shaped. His pointed chin made his face shape look relatively delicate.</p> <p>He was strong, and his long and slender legs were even more pleasant to look at than Yang Jianhua’s. His strong manly vibe perfectly neutralized the gentleness produced by his delicate face.</p> <p>He was actually close with Lin Qiao. Before the apocalypse, they were comrades in arms, serving in the same squad.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to Lin Feng as she wanted to check his injuries. But once she moved, Lin Wenwen and the others shouted at her and made her stop.</p> <p>“Who are you? Stay away!” They were already in a dangerous situation, so they surely couldn’t let a strange man get close to them. Both Lin Wenwen and Lin Hao fixed their eyes on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“He isn’t a man…Eh…I mean, he isn’t a bad man…Eh, that’s not right either. Ah, I mean, don’t be nervous. He’s here to help you. He said that he knows you.” Under the tense situation, Du Yuanxing hurriedly explained for Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Seeing her brother and sister keeping vigilance against her, Lin Qiao didn’t feel good. But, she knew that now wasn’t the time for that. It seemed that to save Lin Feng, she needed to make them let their guard down first.</p> <p>She took a step backward. Just now, she had roughly observed Lin Feng, and found that his energy was almost drained. She had also seen a faint piece of shadow gathering slowly in his chest.</p> <p>She understood that his lungs were broken, and were bleeding. Fortunately, he had coughed out some blood before, and now, his condition wasn’t too bad.</p> <p>She took out a piece of paper and wrote—’I can cure him.’</p> <p>Finishing writing, she threw the note at Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>As the Lin Family had fallen into the hole, Lin Feng was no longer carried by Lin Hao. Instead, he was sitting on the ground and leaning against the wall. Mrs. Lin kept Lin Xiaolu in her arms, while all the others were standing before Lin Feng.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen didn’t catch the piece of paper, but looked at Lin Qiao with confusion, then watched the paper fall on the ground. She didn’t understand why this man with sunglasses didn’t speak but chose to write.</p> <p>Standing in the bottom of the hole, Yuan Tianxing glanced around, then found that Lin Qiao was showing no hostility, and that the others were all fine. After that, he climbed back onto the ground and saw that Yang Jianhua was trapped by a strange gust of wind.</p> <p>The wind was blowing around Yang Jianhua’s body like a tornado. Yang Jianhua was in the center of the tornado, and a white figure had been hiding in the wind. From time to time, it would dart out and attack Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>As the giant tornado was spinning swiftly, Yuan Tianxing couldn’t see Yang Jianhua clearly. He was as powerful as Yang Jianhua. However, as he had suffered some internal injuries, he couldn’t defeat the latter at the moment.</p> <p>He felt that that shadowy white figure was especially powerful. It had been giving him a pressure of energy which he had only sensed from level-seven human beings. However, the pressure he sensed from this white figure was slightly different from the one he sensed from level-seven superpowered human beings.</p> <p>He just didn’t know what exactly was the difference.</p> <p>“Tianxing, just get us out here.” Mrs. Lin said. Yuan Tianxing turned back to nod at her and responded, “Yes, Madam. Be careful.”</p> <p>While speaking, he made a step back, then spread his fingers toward the hole. After that, he crooked his fingers, as if holding something, then slowly raised his arms.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao felt that the earth under her feet was vibrating. For some reason, the sunken ground now began rising. The others seemed to know what would happen; they all calmly waited for the earth to rise.</p> <p>As Yuan Tianxing’s arms were raised higher and higher, the earth under their feet was raised as well.</p> <p>Since Lin Qiao and the others showed up, not even a single man had rushed out of the few vehicles, or made the slightest noise. Once the earth started rising, Lin Qiao leaped out of the hole directly.</p> <p>Her jumping ability made Lin Wenwen and the others look at her with surprise. Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying were used to that, so the two of them paid less attention to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>At that point, Yang Jianhua, who was trapped in the tornado, was already infuriated. He had found out what that white figure was. It was a young female zombie!</p> <p>It looked young, but its attack was very powerful.</p>",
  "Chapter 135: That’s A Zombie": "<p>People saw that Yang Jianhua’s body was covered in an ice shield. From time to time, something would hit against the ice shield and create silvery noises.</p> <p>Only Yang Jianhua knew that what caused the noises were the wind blades which had been blowing at him from the tornado. Normal wind blades were invisible. People could only recognize them by the sounds they caused. However, the wind blades created by this young female zombie were completely visible.</p> <p>Those wind blades looked like tiny horizontal tornadoes spinning swiftly; they were able to create holes in their target’s body within a blink.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua had never seen a wind-powered human being who was able to attack with the wind like this. Even Lu Zhuofeng, the leader of the Hidden Cloud base who possessed level-seven wind power, didn’t have such a strong wind power.</p> <p>He didn’t think anyone else could spare the willpower to control a great amount of wind blades while controlling the tornado!</p> <p>While feeling surprised because of the young female zombie’s power, Yang Jianhua didn’t stop waving his hands inside the ice shield and sending ice blades shooting at the white figure.</p> <p>However, as the young female zombie was hiding in the tornado and constantly moving, Yang Jianhua couldn’t possibly hurt her. He launched a fierce wave of attack, yet all her ice blades were shattered by the wind blades.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a while watching the fight between Qiu Lili and Yang Jianhua after hopping back onto the ground. She found that Qiu Lili had managed to suppress Yang Jianhua completely, and that the latter didn’t seem to be able to free himself from the current situation unless he launched a massive attack.</p> <p>After bringing the people in the whole back onto the ground, Yuan Tianxing looked at Lin Qiao from head to toe, then turned his eyes toward Yang Jianhua again.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao expected, Yang Jianhua soon prepared to launch a massive attack. A white light suddenly shone from his ice shield. An exceptionally strong energy was gathered in there, seeming about to explode.</p> <p>Qiu Lili, who was hiding in the tornado, suddenly stepped out of the wind and showed up outside the tornado, standing on top of a tree which wasn’t very tall.</p> <p>She lightly stood on the tree top, looking like an ancient martial artist. No one knew how she managed to do that.</p> <p>She fixed her eyes on Yang Jianhua. Her red eyes with dark circles now showed a desire for winning. She reached her both hands toward him, fingers spread and slightly crooked.</p> <p>Following her moves, the tornado surrounding Yang Jianhua’s body began shrinking.</p> <p>Crack! Puff!</p> <p>The shrinking tornado peeled the edge of the vehicle under Yang Jianhua’s feet. As Qiu Lili’s tornado was shrinking, Yang Jianhua’s ice shield was spreading. Soon, the vehicle was covered by a thick layer of ice which protected it from the tornado.</p> <p>Suddenly, Yang Jianhua’s white and thick ice shield began swelling.</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>It exploded and broke Qiu Lili’s tornado. A large amount of ice pieces darted out, falling on the ground.</p> <p>The exploding sound caught everyone’s attention.</p> <p>“Eh! That’s… That’s… a zombie! It’s neck and neck with Yang Jianhua! Is it a zombie queen?” Mrs. Lin abruptly fixed her eyes on Qiu Lili and said with surprise.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin was the oldest among all, and she didn’t have a superpower. However, she was experienced and did have sharp eyes. She threw out the question that everyone wanted to ask, and gave an answer.</p> <p>Lin Hao, Lin Wenwen, and the others all turned to Qiu Lili with surprise.</p> <p>They had heard about level-six zombie queens and kings, but none of them had seen one. However, Mrs. Lin was pretty sure that Qiu Lili was at level-six. In fact, everyone could tell that Qiu Lili was incredibly strong indeed.</p> <p>“Mom… are you sure that it’s a zombie queen?” Lin Hao squatted. While supporting the unconscious Lin Feng, he asked his mother with doubt.</p> <p>“I’ve heard from your elder sister that zombie kings and queens have colorful eyes. Their energies can reach their eyes and change their colors.” Mrs. Lin kept staring at Qiu Lili while nodding and answering her son’s questions.</p> <p>“Really? So, is that what a zombie queen looks like? It looks just like a human being, except for its eyes, right?” Cheng Wangxue said. She seemed to have recovered from the pain in her foot already.</p> <p>“It managed to suppress Yang Jianghua’s level-six ice power at the beginning, so I think it’s a zombie queen indeed,” Yuan Tianxing joined the conversation as well. He had been watching the fight all this while. After seeing Qiu Lili’s face clearly, he agreed with Mrs. Lin.</p> <p>Hearing them say that Qiu Lili was a zombie queen, Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying who stood beside them glanced at each other in shock.</p> <p>“She… She’s a zombie queen?” Du Yuanxing couldn’t help but speak out loud. Recalling that they had been sitting in the same car with a zombie queen these days, both Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying somehow shivered.</p> <p>As for Qiu Lili, she suddenly got angry after Yang Jianhua broke her tornado. She pouted, staring at Yang Jianhua unhappily. ‘Not happy! This man is weaker than me! But he actually broke my great tornado!’</p> <p>The unhappy Qiu Lili trod high in the air and abruptly swung her arms toward Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>A giant amount of wind blades appeared before her, darting toward Yang Jianhua at lightning speed. The latter had blown up his ice shield already. As Qiu Lili launched a new wave of attack, he immediately raised his arms and created an ice mirror to defend himself.</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p> <p>The spinning wind blades pierced onto his ice mirror.</p> <p>At that moment, Mrs. Lin raised another question, “Eh? This zombie queen has red eyes, which means she’s supposed to have fire power. I think only the fire energy is red in color. But, she’s attacking with wind… Is it…”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin knitted her brows and lost was in her thoughts. At the same time, Lin Qiao suddenly turned invisible. As everyone was paying attention to Qiu Lili, the zombie queen, she silently moved to Lin Feng’s side.</p> <p>Before anyone noticed her movements, she pressed a hand on Lin Feng’s body.</p> <p>She knew that Lin Feng was in a very dangerous situation, and needed to be healed immediately. However, it was impossible for her mother, brother, and sister to give the severely injured Lin Feng to her, who now looked like a strange and mysterious man.</p> <p>It required time for them to relax their vigilance against her, but she didn’t want to wait any longer. The longer she waited, the greater danger Lin Feng would have to face.</p>",
  "Chapter 136: He Has A Space": "<p>Under dangerous situations, Lin Qiao would always act before reporting. As same as the old time, she now decided to take action first. She planned to steal Lin Feng away, then try to explain to the others after she saved him.</p> <p>Therefore, she made herself invisible and jumped into action.</p> <p>At that moment, Qiu Lili was infuriated, because she couldn’t break Yang Jianhua’s ice mirror. Her wind blades had created countless holes on the ice mirror, yet Yang Jianhua fixed it soon.</p> <p>That was reasonable though. In terms of the power type, the wind power was no match for the ice power, which allowed its possessors to create actual entities. Therefore, Qiu Lili was gradually failing to suppress Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua had figured out Qiu Lili’s power level through the last round of fighting, which lasted for less than a minute. He knew that her wind power was no threat to him. He had also learned that Qiu Lili had no strategies, as she launched a powerful attack at the beginning and never tried to defend herself. Her way of fighting was simple, even childish in his eyes.</p> <p>At the moment, Yang Jianhua was supporting the ice mirror with one hand and waving his other hand strangely. Following his movements, waves of icicles, ice blades, and ice thorns emerged before the ice mirror, flying at Qiu Lili endlessly.</p> <p>Therefore, the people on the ground saw that Yang Jianhua, who stood on the car roof, and the zombie, which trod on top of a tree, had started a competition of superpowers.</p> <p>Qiu Lili watched Yang Jianhua defend himself by using the ice mirror as a shield while throwing large amounts of ice weapons at her. Her wind blades had shattered many of the ice weapons, yet, some still flew at her.</p> <p>So, she hurriedly took a hand back to raise another tornado to surround her and defend against the ice weapons.</p> <p>As Qiu Lili began to defend herself, the look in Yang Jianhua’s eyes changed a little, and his hands moved abruptly. After that, some ice blades quietly emerged right above Qiu Lili’s head, which wasn’t covered by the wind, pointing straight at it.</p> <p>“Look! Yang Jianhua’s launching a sneak attack again!” Cheng Wangxue and the others had widened their eyes to watch the fight. Maybe because Qiu Lili was the enemy of their enemy, they somehow wanted her to win. Qiu Lili was a zombie, but she hadn’t hurt them. Unlike her, the human being Yang Jianhua had lied to them and hunted them, also murdering one of their family members.</p> <p>Therefore, they had unwittingly taken Qiu Lili’s side.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao had already pressed a hand on Lin Feng’s shoulder. She raised his eyes to glance at the others, then suddenly showed her face. But in the next second, she disappeared together with Lin Feng.</p> <p>“Eh? Brother? Where’s my brother?” Lin Hao, who had been holding Lin Feng, noticed his disappearance the first. He didn’t know what happened, but only felt that the weight carried on his arms was gone before his brother vanished.</p> <p>He vanished!</p> <p>Lin Hao was startled, bursting in screams.</p> <p>Once he screamed out loud, the others immediately turned to him. The place where Lin Feng sat in was now empty. Lin Hao’s arms were still raised, face filled with confusion.</p> <p>“Brother! Where’s my brother?” The look in Lin Wenwen’s face changed as she shouted out. Mrs. Lin, Cheng Wangxue, and Lin Xiaolu all started looking around in a panic. However, none of them saw a trace of him.</p> <p>“Lin Feng! Lin Feng!”</p> <p>“Daddy! Where…where’s Daddy?”</p> <p>“Where’s that guy with sunglasses? Why isn’t he here?” The leader of the last five soldiers was a man at his twenties. He pointed at where Lin Qiao was and asked that question. The others turned to that direction, but saw nothing.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing’s face turned cold. He thought that guy was a friend who wouldn’t hurt his people. But now, he guessed that he was wrong.</p> <p>He immediately turned to Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying and asked with a stern voice, “Do you know something? Didn’t you say that he’s here to help Lin Feng? What’s going on?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying were much calmer than the rest of them. Du Yuanixng waved his hand under the sharp gaze of his Deputy Chief and responded hurriedly, “He’s really not a bad guy! Don’t worry!”</p> <p>He knew that Lin Qiao had a space. As both the zombie and Lin Feng had disappeared, he figured that the zombie had sneakily brought Lin Feng into the space while nobody was paying attention to him. However, he didn’t know how the zombie prepared to heal his Great Captain.</p> <p>After all, he didn’t know that the water of the lake in Lin Qiao’s space had a healing power yet.</p> <p>At that moment, Long Qingying suddenly saw the note lying beside Lin Wenwen’s feet. She walked over and picked it up.</p> <p>“Don’t be nervous! Wenwen, see…” She spread the paper and said, then handed the paper to Lin Wenwen. “He might have a way to cure Great Captain. Great Captain’s condition isn’t too bad at the moment, so the earlier he gets some help, the earlier you can stop worrying.” Long Qingying continued.</p> <p>“Make it clear first. Where did he take Lin Feng?” Asked Yuan Tianxing.<br/>\nLin Qiao had surely frightened these people by suddenly taking Lin Feng away. Long Qingying glanced at Du Yuanxing, signaled for him to speak.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing glanced at the others who were all staring at him nervously and angrily, as if they would pounce on him and tear him into pieces if he failed to give a reasonable explanation.</p> <p>“Hem…um,” Du Yuanxing said under pressure, “He has a space. I think he has taken Great Captain there. We’ve spent a few days with him, and we both feel that he…Well, he won’t hurt Great Captain. Let’s just wait. As long as his friend is still here, we don’t need to worry that he might leave with Great Captain.”</p> <p>While saying the word ‘friend’, he pointed at Qiu Lili, who was fighting intensely against Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>Hearing his words, the others all had their expressions changed. They immediately turned their heads toward Qiu Lili with disbelief, then looked back at Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>“What did you say? Did that man bring this zombie queen here? Isn’t he a human being? Why is he with this zombie?” Lin Qiao widened his eyes and asked.</p> <p>“He isn’t a human being,” said Long Qingying blandly.</p> <p>Once she said that, the others all fell into silence while their pupils shrank. They even began to doubt their own ears.</p>",
  "Chapter 137: Qiu Lili Is Pissed Off": "<p>“He… he… he isn’t a human being. So, he is a…” Mrs. Lin’s voice trembled a little. She looked at Qiu Lili, then at Du Yuanxing, seeming to be confirming something, yet wasn’t willing to say it out loud. It was as if as long as she didn’t say it out, it wouldn’t be true.</p> <p>According to Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing, the guy with the sunglasses wasn’t a human being. And, he was a friend of this level-six young female zombie… Didn’t that mean that… Was he a zombie too?</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at Mrs. Lin and quickly nodded, “Yes, he is a zombie. But, he is a special zombie.”</p> <p>“Oh no! Is he going to eat Lin Feng? He’s a zombie… so how can he possibly save human beings?” Mrs. Lin dropped her eyes and murmured in despair.</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue’s legs were softened as well. Her injured legs failed to support her body, so she almost sat on the ground. Fortunately, Lin Wenwen held her timely.</p> <p>“Wangxue!”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen, who was startled by Cheng Wangxue, immediately came back to her senses. She turned to Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing, then burst in yells, “Long Qingying! Did you bring these zombies here to hurt us? He’s a zombie! How can a zombie possibly save my brother!”</p> <p>Long Qingying kept the calm look and shook her head as she responded, “Wenwen, I didn’t lie. Believe me, he’ll show up with Great Captain later.”</p> <p>Seeing the scary-looking expressions on Lin Wenwen and her family’s face, Du Yuanxing stepped aside slightly and then said carefully, “Yeah, yeah… Great Captain has already been taken away by him anyway. We can only wait. There’s nothing else we can do for now.”</p> <p>“You!” Lin Hao suddenly stood up, seeming to raise his hand to attack Du Yuanxing. However, Mrs. Lin stopped him.</p> <p>“Hao, don’t do it now! Let’s believe them for now. If Lin Feng doesn’t show up later, we’ll do it,” she said. At the moment, Yuan Tianxing had also been fixing his eyes on Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying. His sharp gaze nearly pierced through the two.</p> <p>“Eh…” Du Yuanxing said with a low voice, “He’s really not a bad zombie. He’s a good zombie! He’s saved our lives a couple of times. And look, he can write. He’s different from the other zombies.”</p> <p>While speaking, he pointed at the paper wad in Lin Wenwen’s hand.</p> <p>‘You bloody zombie! I want to kill you! How dare you steal Great Captain away under everyone’s eyes! How are we supposed to explain to them?’ He cursed Lin Qiao in his head.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen hadn’t read the note yet. Hearing Du Yuanxing’s words, she pushed Cheng Wangxue to Lin Hao, signaling the latter to hold her, then spread the paper and saw a few words written on it.</p> <p><em>‘I can cure him.’</em></p> <p>On the other side, Qiu Lili had still been fighting against Yang Jianhua. After creating tens of ice blades above her head, Yang Jianhua suddenly increased the number and sizes of the ice weapons before his face, and threw all of them at her.</p> <p>The larger sized icicles and ice blades were surely heavier than the smaller ones. They flew at Qiu Lili at a higher speed, immediately crushing the wind blades around her.</p> <p>She hurriedly made the tornado spin faster to protect her from Yang Jianhua’s attack. However, she failed to notice that tens of finger-thick but incredibly sharp and strong ice blades suddenly fell from the sky, stabbing straight at her head.</p> <p>Her hands paused abruptly, then she raised her head to find tens of sparkling ice blades swishing toward her head. She had no idea when he had created these ice blades right above her head. She didn’t think that Yang Jianhua would stab her in the back!</p> <p>Looking at the falling ice blades, Qiu Lili knew it was already too late for her to raise her arms to defend herself. So, she suddenly opened her mouth and uttered a scream.</p> <p>A series of cracking noises were heard after her scream. The others all felt that their brains were vibrated, then went unconscious.</p> <p>The ice blades above Qiu Lili’s heads were all shattered into pieces, falling on her head and face.</p> <p>After closing her mouth, Qiu Lili’s look changed. Her face twisted a little and eyes shone with a bright red light. Meanwhile, she began baring her shiny white teeth.</p> <p>This time, she was really pissed off!</p> <p>Qiu Lili was furious. A furious zombie queen could be extremely terrifying!</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>“Ow-er!”</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>“Whoo…”</p> <p>Waves of unpleasant and scary zombie roars could suddenly be heard from the surrounding area, following which, large groups of ordinary zombies showed up from all sorts of corners.</p> <p>These zombies rushed at the few vehicles and scratched them, crowding around the vehicles like ants. Some of them were stabbed to death by the thorns on the vehicles, but more zombies climbed up through their bodies and made the vehicles swing.</p> <p>At that point, Qiu Lili’s eyes glowed with a red light and her claws were spread out. All of a sudden, waves of light radiated from her body, and soon, the ice pieces on her hair and face disappeared.</p> <p>Those ice pieces seemed to be evaporated.</p> <p>Then, she reached her hands toward Yang Jianhua, prepared to pounce on him directly. But in the next second, she stopped abruptly and turned to scream toward Lin Hao and his family.</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>The zombies which were approaching them paused simultaneously, then turned away from them reluctantly and slowly, moving toward the vehicles.</p> <p>At the moment, Yang Jianhua had woken up from the shock brought by Qiu Lili’s last scream. He glanced at the suddenly appeared zombie crowd, then raised his hand high and made a gesture toward the sky.</p> <p>After that, the few armored vehicles which hadn’t done anything till now finally began moving. The weapons placed on the vehicles all fired at the zombies, producing waves of gunshots.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the space, Lin Qiao had no spare attention for what was happening on the outside after she brought Lin Feng in.</p> <p>Seeing the shadow in Lin Feng’s chest become larger and larger, she hurriedly put him on a long couch and helped him to lie down. Then, she picked a cup from the table nearby and ran to the lake. After fetching some water from the lake, she ran back to the couch and slowly poured it into his mouth.</p> <p>Lin Feng had already passed out. However, his teeth were clenched tight. Therefore, Lin Qiao had no choice but to open his jaw with one hand and pour the water into his mouth with the other.</p> <p>As he was lying flatly, Lin Qiao easily made the water flow into his throat by slightly lifting his head.</p>",
  "Chapter 138: The Shadow in His Chest": "<p>Junjun sensed Lin Qiao, so she walked out of the small space with the little boy to see what the latter was doing.</p> <p>She curiously watched Lin Qiao trying to heal Lin Feng. She guessed that Lin Feng was the one that Lin Qiao had been looking for, but she didn’t know about their relationship. Judging by Lin Qiao’s attitude toward Lin Feng, she figured that they were pretty close. No wonder Lin Qiao went all the way to the South from Sea City to find him. Fortunately, she came back timely. If she were even a little bit late, this man might have been in serious trouble.</p> <p>After pouring a cup of water into Lin Feng’s mouth, Lin Qiao took off her sunglasses to observe the shadow in Lin Feng’s chest with her bare eyes. She found that the shadow had stopped expanding.</p> <p>Junjun carried the little boy, stood beside Lin Qiao. Sensing Lin Feng’s scent, she took a deep breath. Her appetite for human flesh was no longer as strong as before.</p> <p>Then, she turned to look at the lake in Lin Qiao’s space, wondering where the water came from and where it was going to. After staying In Lin Qiao’s space for a while, she had felt that the lake wasn’t as simple as it seemed.</p> <p>Every time when she nearly lost control of herself and wanted to eat her son, she would go to the lake and drink from it. With that, her mind would become much clearer than before. That was the most noticeable effect of the lake water to her.</p> <p>Apart from that, she had eaten Lin Qiao’s snake meat as well, because she was starving. Every time she walked past the few buckets which contained snake meat and lake water, she would sense the snake scent.</p> <p>When making snake soup for the little boy, she would force herself to eat some raw snake meat. She had tried boiled snake meat too, and found that it tasted even worse than the raw meat. So, after learning how bad the snake meat tasted after being boiled, she moved on to accept the raw snake meat.</p> <p>Therefore, from time to time, she would go pick some snake meat from those buckets for herself to eat. During that process, she was quite amazed by the effect of the lake water in keeping it fresh.</p> <p>Maybe because the snake meat had been soaked in the lake water for quite some time, she felt that it tasted less awful than before.</p> <p>As the shadow in Lin Feng’s chest stopped expanding, Lin Qiao sighed slightly in relief. She waited for a few minutes, but the shadow didn’t show any sign of shrinking. So, she thought for a moment and went to get another cup of water, then poured it into Lin Feng’s mouth.</p> <p>Junjun also knew that the lake water had a healing power for human beings, because during the past few days, the little boy had become much healthier by drinking it. His body had even started to gain weight.</p> <p>Junjun felt that her son was slowly becoming more and more energetic.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao giving Lin Feng the lake water, she wondered what Lin Feng’s condition was.</p> <p>After making Lin Feng drink the second cup of water, Lin Qiao saw that the shadow in his chest started changing, beginning to disappear from the edge.</p> <p><em>‘So, it was because the water wasn’t enough!’ </em>As the shadow started fading, Lin Qiao immediately figured something out. Since the water wasn’t enough, the energy it contained was undoubtedly insufficient as well.</p> <p>With that thought, Lin Qiao turned to get the third cup of water, then made Lin Feng drink it.</p> <p>After the third cup of water was poured into Lin Feng’s mouth, Lin Qiao found that the shadow was fading faster than before. Soon, she saw the faintly green energy lingering in Lin Feng’s chest.</p> <p>On the outside, the people who were knocked unconscious by Qiu Lili’s scream slowly woke up. Yuan Tianxing’s face paled as a few drops of blood flowed out of his mouth corners. He abruptly covered his chest with his hand, because he felt that his internal organs were shaken badly.</p> <p>But soon, he forgot about his injuries. He looked at the surrounding zombies which showed up suddenly, then covered his chest with one hand and reached out the other to press in the air before raising them.</p> <p>Following his moves, an earth wall slowly rose around the Lin Family people to defend them. After that, Yuan Tianxing held the wall with one hand, then leaned against it and breathed quickly.</p> <p>But then, he found something strange. It seemed that the surrounding zombies didn’t even see them, all fiercely rushing at Yang Jianhua’s vehicles.</p> <p>“Eh?” He looked at those zombies bewilderedly.</p> <p><em>‘What the hell? Are they ignoring me? But, I’m a living human being!’ </em>He couldn’t understand.</p> <p>Next, he saw Qiu Lili charge at Yang Jianhua with a ferocious look. Her ten claws were burning with a purple-red fire.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua’s sneak attack failed to hurt Qiu Lili, but pissed her off awfully. She would surely get angry. After all, this handsome-looking man nearly cut off her hair.</p> <p>As Qiu Lili charged at him fleetingly and showed up right before his face within a blink, Yang Jianhua hurriedly raised the ice mirror to protect himself.</p> <p>Qiu Lili ignored the ice mirror. The red light in her eyes grew stronger as she darted up to the ice mirror, raised her arm high, and swung directly down toward it.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>Her burning claws scratched the ice mirror and immediately cracked the mirror which seemed to be unbreakable. Right after that, a thunderous noise could be heard as the ice mirror was shattered into pieces.</p> <p>Under the explosion of the ice mirror, Yang Jianhua felt that the ice pieces were all flying at his face. He automatically turned his face away and raised his arms to shield his face, also leaping backward to try dodging Qiu Lili’s continuous attack.</p> <p>But at that point, Qiu Lili was right before him. How could she let him dodge so easily? Her other palm was swinging directly at Yang Jianhua’s face along with a streak of fire.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>Yang Jianhua managed to create another ice shield to defend himself against Qiu Lili’s claws, but the latter destroyed it in no time. But still, Yang Jianhua grasped an opportunity to turn and run.</p> <p>“Retreat!” He gave a shout while stepping on the zombie heads and running toward a safer area.</p> <p><em>‘Wanna run? Not gonna happen!’ </em>Seeing that Yang Jianhua was preparing to run, Qiu Lili snorted and moved swiftly, followed behind him.</p> <p>The people in the car received Yang Jianhua’s order of retreat and prepared to drive away. Once the vehicles moved, the zombies on them all fell off.</p>",
  "Chapter 139: Yang Jianhua Retreats": "<p>The vehicles were all strongly armored, so these ordinary zombies weren’t able to do them any harm no matter how hard they tried. Therefore, the soldiers in the cars drove the cars away very calmly, leaving the zombie crowd following behind.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later, Yang Jianhua, Qiu Lili, the zombie crowd, and Yang Jianhua’s soldiers who had been hiding in the cars all the time for some reason had left.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing leaned against the earth wall, watching the situation unfold with confusion.</p> <p><em>‘That’s it?’ </em>He thought. The sneaky Yang Jianhua showed up in full fury and threatened the Lin Family, yet ended up being scared away by a weird zombie queen.</p> <p>He guessed that not even Yang Jianhua himself had predicted that.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing was preparing to neglect his injuries and fight another battle against Yang Jianhua. However, two zombies came out of nowhere. One of them sneakily took Lin Feng away, while the other one beat Yang Jianhua off and went to chase him. It seemed that the second zombie wouldn’t give up until Yang Jianhua was hurt!</p> <p>“This… Why is there a wall? Tianxing? Are you out there?” Before Yuan Tianxing figured out a thing, Lin Wenwen’s voice was heard from behind the earth wall.</p> <p>He came back to his senses and looked around to find that those disgusting-looking ordinary zombies had all followed Yang Jianhua away, and the area around him had become a zombie-free safe zone.</p> <p>Only the stink of zombies remained in the air.</p> <p>“What is… What happened just now?” Mrs. Lin asked.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing held the wall and stood straight, raising a hand to wipe away the blood from his mouth corners. Only after that did he lower the earth wall and let the people behind it out.</p> <p>“What happened… Why did you build a wall around us? Ah, why was my brain blank just now?” Asked Lin Hao confusedly.</p> <p>While speaking, he raised his head to find a large number of zombie bodies around him, and the dark-red zombie blood all over the ground. He then looked further and saw the backs of many zombies tens of meters away.</p> <p>“That… What’s going on? Why are there so many zombies? And, why are they all heading that way?” Lin Wenwen didn’t understand why those zombies ignored a group of living human being but all moved that way.</p> <p>“Yang Jianhua’s people and vehicles have all left!” Long Qingying said abruptly.</p> <p>“Yang Jianhua and that zombie are gone as well! Long Qingying, are you sure that the zombie with sunglasses is still here?” Lin Hao quickly looked around, then asked Long Qingying with a loud voice.</p> <p>Once noticing that both Yang Jianhua and Qiu Lili had disappeared, the Lin Family people forgot about what happened earlier and stopped wondering why Yuan Tianxing built a wall around them.</p> <p>Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing glanced at each other. Neither of them could give an answer, because Lin Qiao and Lin Feng had disappeared for a while, and the young female zombie had left as well.</p> <p>“Lin Feng… Lin Feng isn’t eaten, is he?” Mrs. Lin spoke in panic. Once she said that, the others all fixed their eyes on Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying.</p> <p>“The other day, they showed up in the South, asking around about you.” Long Qingying said, “They happened to run into us and saved us for a few times. Back then, we didn’t tell them about you, yet they still found out. In the end, when we were trapped and hopeless, they saved us again.”</p> <p>Hearing Long Qingying’s words, Du Yuanxing hurriedly nodded and echoed, “Yeah, yeah, yeah! At first, he told us that he was looking for you was gonna help you. We didn’t believe him either, so we didn’t tell him much. But later on, he said that he would go to Sea City to find you. Huo Wu failed to kill us, and will certainly try again. So, we left the South and followed him to you.”</p> <p>Lin Hao snorted and responded, “You’re so brave that you traveled with two zombies which can destroy you within a blink of an eye. But, it’s been so long, and my brother and that zombie haven’t shown up yet. How do you explain that?”</p> <p>“We didn’t know that… that little girl is a… a zombie queen.” Du Yuanxing muttered. If they knew that, they would never dare to follow them! Before, Du Yuanxing thought that both Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili were at level-four or five. After all, the zombie which could write to communicate with human beings couldn’t be ordinary.</p> <p>During the journey, only the zombie who had stolen his sunglasses had been communicating with him and Long Qingying. The young female zombie in a white dress didn’t even look at them. Once out of the car, she would stay far away from them.</p> <p>“You don’t even know them well enough.” Lin Wenwen glared at Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing and said harshly.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and the others didn’t know Du Yuanxing well, and had never talked to him. However, they all knew his name, as he was a level-five superpowered person. Lin Feng was the only one who had spoken to him.</p> <p>Long Qingying met Lin Wenwen after the base was built. They became close after Lin Wenwen once helped Long Qingying during a zombie-hunting mission outside the base. Therefore, it was reasonable for Lin Qiao not to know Long Qingying.</p> <p>“That’s not important! What’s important is that he didn’t do us any harm. On the contrary, he saved our lives.” Long Qingying said blandly.</p> <p>She herself felt strange about that as well.</p> <p>In the post-apocalyptic era, even human beings wouldn’t help other human beings sometimes. Everyone needed to try as hard as they could to save themselves, so who would care about strangers?</p> <p>However, that zombie saved her and Du Yuanxing a few times. At first, she suspected the zombie for having other purposes. But, since the latter had saved her, she had no choice but to accept that fact. At least, the zombie seemed to be harmless to them. However, she had still been keeping vigilance toward the two zombies all the way.</p> <p>She didn’t want to believe that the zombie really wanted to help, but what else could she do? As the zombie and his friends also wanted to find Lin Feng, she decided to join them.</p> <p>“He saved you for a purpose. He’s a zombie, so why would he save you? He must be up to something!” Lin Hao joined the conversation.</p> <p>The Lin Family people stared at Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing seriously. They wanted to believe the two, but they couldn’t understand why a zombie, which knew nothing but eating human beings, would save them. Besides, how on earth could a zombie cure Lin Feng?</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing had been looking at the others silently, not because he didn’t want to talk, but because he was barely standing. After hearing Qiu Lili’s scream, his internal injuries had gotten worse, and his mind nearly broke down. He knew that he couldn’t let himself collapse at this moment; so with no other choice, he forced himself to stay clear-minded.</p>",
  "Chapter 140: Lin Feng Is Waking Up": "<p>“It’s real!” Du Yuanxing said with an anxious look, “The male zombie has space power. His space is huge. We’ve been in it.”</p> <p>Long Qingying nodded in agreement and said, “Yes, we’ve entered his space. It’s huge.”</p> <p>“If it wants to save Lin Feng, why did it take him away sneakily?” Mrs. Lin asked, “Can you tell if it really wants to help Lin Feng or not? At least, it needs to help Lin Feng under our witness. Who would know what it’s really been up to if it keeps everything secret from us?”</p> <p>“That… that…” Du Yuanxing didn’t know how to respond, but turned to Long Qingying to seek help. Mrs. Lin was right, so he had no idea how to explain.</p> <p>Long Qingying thought for a moment and said, “I guess he’s afraid that you may not believe him, and it might require too much time to convince you. Earlier on, I saw Lin Feng in a rather bad condition. He should be helped as early as possible, so that there can be a better chance for him to recover.”</p> <p>What happened had already happened. Even though the Lin Family people were so worried, they had no other choice but to wait with the last gleam of hope. They couldn’t believe what Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing said, even though they wanted to. But still, they hoped that their words were real.</p> <p>They hoped that the zombie was truly here to help them, and that it could cure Lin Feng, and that it would show up again later on with Lin Feng. However, their minds had been reminding them how impossible that was. Why on earth would a strange zombie help them? What did it want? Perhaps, it wanted Lin Feng’s level-six energy nucleus!</p> <p>When the Lin Family people were waiting in both despair and a slight trace of hope, two figured showed up behind Lin Wenwen and Lin Hao, right where Lin Feng lay earlier on.</p> <p>As the Lin Family people had each made a few steps forward when talking to Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying, Lin Qiao and Lin Feng were now behind them.</p> <p>After coming out of her space with the unconscious Lin Feng, Lin Qiao turned her head to see the backs of her family. She habitually wanted to raise a foot to kick Lin Hao’s butt when she saw it, but as she needed to hold Lin Feng for the moment, she could only remain squatting.</p> <p>She glanced at her little brother’s butt that she wanted to kick but couldn’t, then reluctantly turned her eyes. After that, she saw that Yuan Tianxing was staring at her. However, the latter didn’t say anything to remind the others.</p> <p>At the sight of him, Lin Qiao found that his face was pale and he too had a shadow in his chest. The same kind of shadow had also been gathering in his shoulders, waist, stomach, and legs.</p> <p><em>‘He’s injured so badly, but still on his feet. He hasn’t changed at all, always wanting to be stronger and used to endure all the pain. He just won’t let himself fall give up until the last moment.’ </em>Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wasn’t wearing the sunglasses at the moment. She only glanced at Yuan Tianxing quickly before moving her eyes away. Then, she saw Lin Xiaolu who was leaning against her mother.</p> <p>She moved slightly, then reached out a hand to poke the back of Lin Xiaolu’s waist. Lin Xiaolu turned back with confusion, then widened her eyes and burst in yells, “Daddy!”</p> <p>While staring at Lin Qiao and Lin Feng and shouting, she dragged her mother’s arm as hard as she could.</p> <p>“Daddy is back here!”</p> <p>Hearing her words, the others immediately looked at her, then turned back to look behind them. After that, they saw the male zombie holding the head of Lin Feng who was lying on the ground, quietly gazing at them with a pair of black zombie eyes.</p> <p>All of them were startled and automatically stepped backward.</p> <p>In the post-apocalyptic world, any human being would be startled by a zombie which suddenly showed up behind him or her.</p> <p>“Lin Feng!” But, after seeing Lin Feng, Cheng Wangxue neglected her injured foot as well as the zombie, limping forward and rushing toward Lin Feng.</p> <p>Seeing her darting up, Lin Qiao didn’t move, but squatted there and let her come to Lin Feng’s side.</p> <p>The others hesitated for a few seconds. After confirming that Lin Qiao hadn’t shown any hostility, they stepped up alertly and surrounded Lin Feng.</p> <p>“Brother! Brother!”</p> <p>“Brother! How has he been?”</p> <p>Lin Hao too turned back and came close. Lin Qiao pushed Lin Feng toward his family, then stood up and took a step backward.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao had really brought Lin Feng back out, and no new wound was found on his body, the others all stared at Lin Feng with disbelief while checking his body.</p> <p>Lin Hao squatted to hold Lin Feng’s head, then gently pressed a hand on his chest and focused his sensations. After that, he slightly widened his eyes which was filled with disbelief, then raised his head to look at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“My brother is…” He didn’t dare to say for sure, but had to say something. Before he could finish his words, the three ladies had shouted out to ask questions.</p> <p>“How is he?”</p> <p>“How is our brother? Is he healed?”</p> <p>“How’s his injury?”</p> <p>Lin Hao took back his hand which was pressed on Lin Feng’s chest, then lifted his eyelids to check his eyeballs, and then gripped his wrists.</p> <p>Only after that did he continue, “He…He’s fine! He’s in a much better condition than before! Now, he’s just weak, because his energy has run out. His life-force and willpower are both reacting strongly. I think he’ll wake up soon. Brother! Brother!”</p> <p>At the end of his speech, he tried to call Lin Feng.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up, then found that both Qiu Lili and Yang Jianhua had disappeared. Earlier on while trying to cure Lin Feng, she wasn’t paying attention to the outside situation. Only after Lin Feng was almost healed did she close her eyes to sense the outside world. At that time, she found that Mrs. Lin and her others were so worried that they seemed even to want to bite Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing, so she hurriedly brought Lin Feng out.</p> <p>The air was filled with the scent of zombies. She guessed that Qiu Lili had summoned a large number of ordinary zombies to this area earlier, and then began wondering where she was now. Did she go after Yang Jianhua?</p> <p>While raising her nose to sniff at the air, she took out the sunglasses and put them on. She had sensed Qiu Lili’s scent, and found that she followed Yang Jianhua away. Once she started thinking about Yang Jianhua’s face, her head ached again.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and rubbed her temples with her fingers to try and ease that pain in her brain, but it didn’t work. She sighed, then opened her eyes to look at Yuan Tianxing, as she needed to divert her attention from Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing seemed to be in a worse condition than Lin Feng. However, because his energy hadn’t been consumed largely, he managed to remain on his feet.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that she should offer him a cup of water now. Of course, it had to be the water from the lake.</p>",
  "Chapter 141: His Chest Has Stopped Hurting": "<p>Lin Qiao felt that Qiu Lili wouldn’t show up soon, so she turned to look at the others. Lin Wenwen, Lin Hao, Mrs. Lin, Cheng Wangxue, Lin Xiaolu and the other few had surrounded Lin Feng, who was lying on the ground.</p> <p>Earlier on, she paid all her attention to Lin Feng’s condition, but didn’t have the time to look at the others carefully. Now, she gave them a closer look and found that each of them had changed a lot, especially Xiaolu.</p> <p>In Lin Qiao’s memories, Xiaolu was a little baby up to her knees, who had just learned to walk and was still learning how to speak. But now, she could reach Lin Qiao’s waist, and her tiny and chubby arms and legs had all become slender.</p> <p>She was wearing a purple dress and a white coat. Her chubby face had become delicate and adorable, and her eyes were bright and looked canny.</p> <p>She was squatting by Lin Feng’s legs and leaning against her grandmother, but from time to time, she had been turning to Lin Qiao to look at her confusedly and curiously.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen looked much more mature than before. Her pretty face now wore a look of determination. However, Lin Qiao could tell that she was still nice and gentle. As long as her bottom-line wasn’t touched, she would continue to be like a fair lady.</p> <p>Lin Hao had turned into a capable young man from an impatient boy. His good-looking face was now added with a manly presence, that made him look more mature than before.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s younger brother and little sister were both kind and mild, but once they got angry, they would become scary. Not even Lin Qiao dared to piss them off.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and all her siblings had inherited the good genes of their parents. Each of them had a beautiful face; even Lin Feng, who was already thirty-five years old, looked handsome and hearty.</p> <p>Among all of Lin Qiao’s family members, the one who changed the least was her mother. Mrs. Lin was nearly sixty years old, but still looked energetic. Only her vibe had changed a little.</p> <p>She now looked much stronger than before. As always, she had been quietly standing behind her children to support them. Even though her children had all grown up, she still looked at them as children who needed caring.</p> <p>It seemed that the post-apocalyptic world had changed everyone quite a lot. Even Lin Wenwen and Lin Hao, who used to be harmless, now looked a little aggressive. Lin Qiao’s sister-in-law, Cheng Wangxue, still had a hot temper. As same as the old time, she could suffer losses quite easily.</p> <p>Lin Qiao carefully observed her family, and found that except for the injured Lin Feng, the others were all healthy. It seemed that her big brother had been protecting them quite well.</p> <p>She felt lucky for coming back. If she spent an extra couple of days on her journey, she couldn’t imagine how bad the consequences would have been.</p> <p>Thinking that Lin Feng’s energy nucleus might be damaged because of the internal injuries he had suffered, Lin Qiao raised a strong intention of killing toward Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>Maybe because her intention of killing was too obvious, Lin Hao, Lin Wenwen, Yuan Tianxing and the five soldiers suddenly turned to look at her.</p> <p>In their eyes, Lin Qiao was a skinny, medium height man, face covered in scars, wearing a pair of sunglasses, looking exactly like a gangster. Back in the old world, all the kids would be freaked out by a man like that, and even adults would avoid him.</p> <p>However, the Lin Family people now felt that the sunglasses looked better than her pair of black zombie eyes.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Feng’s chest shivered, then he gave a cough.</p> <p>“Em-hem… em-hem… hem…”</p> <p>Hearing his voice, the others immediately turned their heads back and forgot about Lin Qiao temporarily.</p> <p>“Brother! You’re awake!” Lin Wenwen said to Lin Feng with surprise. Seeing Lin Feng slowly opening his eyes, Lin Hao reached out a hand to feel his pulse, then nodded and sighed in relief, “He has woken up. That means he’s healing. He’ll recover soon if he gets enough rest. But, because of our brother’s current condition, we can’t keep running now.”</p> <p>Lin Feng opened his eyes to look at the others and muttered to ask, “What…What happened to me? Did I pass out?”</p> <p>The others nodded in response.</p> <p>“You were holding off Yang Jianhua’s attack, and you vomited blood. Don’t you remember that?” Said Cheng Wangxue.</p> <p>“Ah, I remembered. Where’s Yang Jianhua then? Are you all good?” Lin Feng knitted his brows to think for a moment, then recalled what happened earlier and hurriedly asked them if they were fine.</p> <p>He nervously looked at the others. After finding out that they were all beside him and perfectly unharmed, he sighed in relief. Then, he soon discovered the ones who had arrived later.</p> <p>“Eh? Tianxing! Why are you here? And Qingying…and Du Yuanxing? How did you guys…” Lin Feng greeted those people with surprise and joy.</p> <p>“Daddy! Daddy! How do you feel? Are you in any pain?” Lin Xiaolu had stopped looking at Lin Qiao with curiosity, but fixed her eyes on her dad with worry. Once she said that, the others too began asking about Lin Feng’s situation.</p> <p>“Yeah, Lin Feng, how do you feel now?” Asked Mrs. Lin nervously.</p> <p>“Lin Feng, is your chest still aching? Wasn’t your chest injured before? How do you feel now?” Cheng Wangxue asked.</p> <p>Lin Hao looked at Lin Feng, waiting for him to answer the questions. Being reminded by them, Lin Feng now started paying attention to his body. He took a deep breath, then exhaled slowly.</p> <p>After that, he lowered his head in confusion to check his chest, then raised a hand to press on his chest which was injured before. And then, he looked at the others bewilderedly.</p> <p>“Why is… I think my chest has… stopped hurting. The dull pain caused by broken lungs, and the suffocating feeling caused by the blood stasis, are both gone. I’m breathing smoothly now. Before, I couldn’t even take deep breath.” said Lin Feng.</p> <p>After saying that, he looked at his family with confusion and continued, “Did you give me some magical drug? Or, why is my injury healed so quickly?”</p> <p>Lin Hao and Lin Wenwen shook their heads together to let Lin Feng knew that they didn’t do anything to heal him.</p> <p>“It’s him who saved you, Great Captain!” At that moment, Du Yuanxing suddenly came to Lin Feng, then leaned his head forward from above Lin Hao’s head and said delightedly.</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Feng’s condition had gotten better, he became elated. Earlier on, he felt wronged as the others didn’t believe his words. But now, that feeling was gone. He was even a little proud at the moment.</p>",
  "Chapter 142: The Strange Zombie": "<p>Seeing him, Lin Feng asked curiously, “Du Yuanxing, I was going to ask why you’re here. Didn’t you stay in the base? And, who is ‘him’ that you’re talking about?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing immediately turned back to point at Lin Qiao and responded with, “Ah, him. Do you know him? He says that he knows you…”</p> <p>Lin Feng slowly sat up. Lin Hao hurriedly tried to help his brother, but Lin Feng didn’t let him. Lin Feng stood up from the ground, then found that his movements were smooth and the pain in his chest was really gone.</p> <p>How did that happen? Was his internal injury healed while he was unconscious? What on earth had happened to him that he didn’t know yet?</p> <p>He looked at where Du Yuanxing was pointing at and saw a medium height man, face covered in scars and wearing a pair of sunglasses.</p> <p>He had never seen this man before, and had no idea who he was. So, he looked at Lin Qiao from head to toe, then turned his head to the others with a questioning look.</p> <p>Lin Hao and the others shook their heads and said, “We don’t know him either. We can’t possibly know him since you don’t.”</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at Du Yuanxing, then at Lin Qiao. After that, he turned back to ask his family, “Then what happened earlier? Why am I healed? And, where’s Yang Jianhua?”</p> <p>He glanced around and confirmed that Yang Jianhua wasn’t here. Even his vehicles were gone.</p> <p>“Earlier, when your fire shield was broken, Tianxing sank the earth to protect us from Yang Jianhua’s ice weapons in that dangerous moment.” Mrs. Lin answered the question, “Then, the other few showed up as well.”</p> <p>While speaking, Mrs. Lin pointed at Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying, “Yang Jianhua was beaten off, by a…em…a girl.”</p> <p>She was going to say ‘a female zombie’, but as she realized that Lin Qiao was standing right there, she changed her words.</p> <p>After all, Lin Qiao was really there to help them, for whatever purpose. At least till now, this strange zombie had been showing a friendly attitude. And magically, he somehow managed to heal Lin Feng’s injury within such a short time.</p> <p>“He, he, he said that he knows you, and that’s why he came to find you. Long Qingying and I followed him here from the South, also to find you. Deputy Chief Yuan showed up earlier when you were in danger, and we were just slightly later than him.” Du Yuanxing said.</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at Lin Qiao, then asked Du Yuanxing with a low voice, “He knows me? But I don’t think I know him.”</p> <p>“Well, he said so,” Du Yuanxing replied, also with a low voice.</p> <p>Lin Feng thought carefully and confirmed that he really didn’t know this scar-faced man. Then, he asked Lin Qiao loudly, “May I ask your name? According to them, my injury is cured by you. I can’t do much to express my gratitude to you at the moment. But in the future, if you need any help, please come to me.”</p> <p>Hearing his words, Lin Qiao looked at him and nodded.</p> <p>Lin Feng felt strange about Lin Qiao’s silent response. With a low voice, he asked Du Yuanxing, “I’m sure that I don’t know such a man. Who is he? Don’t you know about that? Which base did he come from?”</p> <p>“Eh…He is…” Du Yuanxing looked at Lin Qiao, wondering if he should directly tell Lin Feng about the fact that this strange man was a zombie instead of a human being.</p> <p>“Brother, he’s not a man. He’s a zombie,” Lin Wenwen said abruptly.</p> <p>Hearing her, Lin Feng widened his eyes in shock, staring at Lin Wenwen and asking, “Wenwen, what did you say? I think I didn’t hear you clearly as the wind is too loud.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen wanted to roll her eyes, while the others wanted to laugh.</p> <p>Lin Hao nodded and said, “That’s true, brother. He is indeed a…eh…a special zombie!”</p> <p>Lin Feng stared at Lin Hao as if the latter was crazy, and the latter felt a little speechless. ‘Damn, I’m telling the truth! Why are you looking at me like that? I’m not crazy!’ Lin Hao complained silently.</p> <p>At that moment, Mrs. Lin put her arm around Lin Xiaolu’s shoulder and said, “You can ask him yourself if you don’t believe it.”</p> <p>While speaking, she glanced at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Feng was so confused by his family. He didn’t believe their words, so he turned to Lin Qiao and continued asking, “Eh, how shall I address you? Why did you help us?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao took out the notepad under Lin Feng’s gaze, then thought for a moment and wrote—’My name is Lu Tianyu. I am a zombie indeed. They didn’t lie to you.’</p> <p>Finishing writing, she tore off the piece of paper, wadded it up, and threw at Lin Feng.</p> <p>Lin Feng’s mind wasn’t fully cleared yet, but still, he automatically caught the wad of paper, then unwrapped it and read the note. After that, the look in his face turned strange.</p> <p>He raised his head and saw that Lin Qiao had taken off her sunglasses to show her completely dark eyes.</p> <p>Compared with Lin Feng who was dumbfounded at the moment, the others seemed to be much calmer. At that point, Yuan Tianxing suddenly fell to the ground on his back.</p> <p>“Deputy Chief Yuan!” Long Qingying saw that first and shouted out loud.<br/>\nHearing her voice, the others immediately turned their heads and found that Yuan Tianxing was already lying on the ground.</p> <p>As no one was paying attention to her, Lin Qiao disappeared from where she was. The others went to Yuan Tianxing and helped him from the ground. They found that his energy had been randomly flowing inside his body, and his vibe was very weak. His face was ghastly pale, eyes closed tightly.</p> <p>“What happened to Deputy Chief Yuan?” Du Yuanxing followed behind the others and asked. Lin Hao felt Yuan Tianxing’s pulse, then pressed a hand on his chest to sense his body condition. After that, he checked a few other parts of Yuan Tianxing’s body, and finally began talking with a serious look.</p> <p>“Brother Tianxing is injured even more severely than my big brother. My brother’s injury got worse because his energy was consumed up, but brother Tianxing has been injured for a month. It seems that he’s been bitting the bullet the whole time, and hasn’t rested.”</p> <p>“He has been missing for a month.” Mrs. Lin said, “I didn’t think that he’d come here to find us. He must have been through something awful. I suppose he has been in a difficult condition this whole while.”</p> <p>Lin Feng finally woke up from the shock given by the fact that he was saved by a zombie. He came over to check on Yuan Tianxing, then said, “Eh, that, that man just now… He cured me just now, so he should be able to cure Yuan Tianxing as well. Where is he?”</p> <p>While speaking, he turned to look at the others, then where Lin Qiao was. However, he didn’t see the zombie. “Eh?” He murmured in confusion as he looked around but failed to find a trace of the zombie.</p>",
  "Chapter 143: The Energy Of The Water": "<p>The others looked around as well and found that Lin Qiao had disappeared indeed.</p> <p>“Did he go back into his space?” Du Yuanxing wondered aloud, “Great Captain, do you have any idea what he did to you earlier?”</p> <p>Lin Feng shook his head with confusion, then asked, “Didn’t you see how he saved me? I was unconscious. How can I possibly know anything?”</p> <p>“He brought you into his space,” Lin Hao said. “So, we don’t know what he did to you. He didn’t ask our permission when taking you. Instead, he just stole you away.”</p> <p>Somehow, Lin Feng felt that Lin Hao made him sound like a lifeless object. So, he looked at Lin Hao with a strange expression and asked, “He stole… well, he sneakily took me away. Didn’t you see it? Did you just let him take me?”</p> <p>He suddenly felt lucky that the zombie didn’t eat him or dig his brains out. If anything like that happened, he wouldn’t even have a chance to come out of that space again. Thinking these, a wave of coldness spread to his entire body from his spine.</p> <p>As the others were prepared to answer his question, a figure suddenly showed up.</p> <p>It was Lin Qiao, holding a cup of water. She walked over and handed the water to Du Yuanxing, who was the nearest to her, then pointed at Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>“Is this for him? What kind of water is this?” Du Yuanxing took over the cup of water without knowing why. He didn’t give the water to Lin Hao, but glanced at the others and asked.</p> <p>He surely didn’t dare to give the water directly to his Deputy Chief, because he wouldn’t know what to do if anything happened to Yuan Tianxing after the latter drank the water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood beside Du Yuanxing, took out the notepad to write.</p> <p>Seeing her coming over, all the others except Long Qingying automatically took two steps backward to get away from her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t care. She was a zombie, so it was already very nice for these people to let her get so close, and it was completely normal for them to want to keep a distance from her. If she didn’t save Lin Feng earlier, these people might not be facing her so peacefully.</p> <p>She saw them as her family, but they saw her as a weird and dangerous zombie.</p> <p>She wrote some words, then instead of ripping off the paper, she raised the notepad to show Du Yuanxing the note.</p> <p>‘I didn’t do anything to Lin Feng but give him a few cups of water like this.’</p> <p>Both Du Yuanxing and Mrs. Lin, who stood beside him, read the note.</p> <p>“This wasn’t isn’t from your lake, is it?” Du Yuanxing knew that Lin Qiao had a lake in her space. Except for the lake, no other water source existed in her space.</p> <p>He thought of the lake and Yang Cheng’s death. The water had soaked a dead man and a dead zombie…</p> <p>Du Yuanxing glanced at the others and felt that he shouldn’t mention it. Earlier on, he had drunk some of the lake water too.</p> <p>‘But, can the water really cure internal injuries?’ He wondered.</p> <p>According to Lin Qiao, Lin Feng was now able to stand up and walk around only because he had drunk a few cups of lake water. However, Du Yuanxing didn’t want to believe it. He thought that maybe the zombie had added something in the water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at him, then put down the notepad. She had told them that the water had a healing power, but she didn’t know if these people would believe her. If they refused to believe her, she would have to get Yuan Tianxing into her space to help him.</p> <p>At the moment, Mrs. Lin was wearing a bewildered look. She felt that this zombie’s handwriting was so familiar, especially the name of Lin Feng that he wrote.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing thought for a moment, then handed the water to Lin Hao and said, “Take a look. I think the water is fine, if it’s from that lake.”</p> <p>Lin Hao took over the water, then dipped his finger into it while asking curiously, “Does he have a lake in his space? How big if his space?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing spent a short while thinking, then responded with, “About three kilometers square. The lake is as large as a football field.”</p> <p>Lin Hao dipped some water from the cup, then rubbed it with his thumb and forefinger. After that, he showed a confused look and said, “Eh? I sensed something different from the water, but I can’t tell what.”</p> <p>His words immediately caught the others’ attention and made them look at him.</p> <p>“What is it?” Asked Lin Feng.</p> <p>Lin Hao put the cup under his nose, then closed his eyes to sniff it. Afterward, he reopened his eyes and said, “It’s filled with energy…Gentle energy. I don’t know what it is.”</p> <p>The others looked at him with curiosity. “You don’t know what kind of energy it is? Is it harmful?” Someone asked.</p> <p>“Energy? I’ve drunk some of the lake water earlier, but, why didn’t I feel any energy?” said Du Yuanxing with surprise.</p> <p>Lin Hao thought for a moment, then took a sip of the water. He held the water in his mouth to feel it with his tongue, then sensed a mild stream of energy flowing within his mouth. There were no wounds to be healed inside his mouth, but that energy made him feel very comfortable.</p> <p>He swallowed that energy, and felt that his esophagus and stomach seemed to have been massaged by someone. He guessed that he would be needing a toilet very soon.</p> <p>Lin Hao nodded, then said, “It’s not harmful. It’s good actually.”</p> <p>Next, he poured the rest of the water slowly into Yuan Tianxing’s mouth.</p> <p>After Lin Hao gave the water to Yuan Tianxing, Lin Qiao walked over, took the cup away from Lin Hao’s hand, then stepped back and disappeared again.</p> <p>While observing Yuan Tianxing’s reaction, the others glanced at where Lin Qiao disappeared from time to time.</p> <p>“Has he entered his space again?” Asked Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“You said that he has a large lake, so his space is even larger, right? What else does he have in there?” Cheng Wangxue asked. At the moment, Lin Feng was holding her, as he had found that his wife’s foot was injured, and that she was nearly disabled from standing.</p> <p>“Yeah! It’s the first time for me to meet a zombie with humanity. And, why did he help us?” Lin Feng asked.</p> <p>“He said that he used to be your friend and subordinate. Don’t you remember him?” Du Yuanxing said. Lin Feng looked at him confusedly and asked, “My friend and subordinate? But, I don’t remember knowing a zombie like him.”</p> <p>“Eh?” Du Yuanxing looked back at Lin Feng, also confusedly, “I guess he meant before he turned into a zombie? You had so many soldiers under your command, so perhaps, you just don’t remember him.”</p> <p>Lin Feng stared at Du Yuanxing while trying very hard to recall that zombie’s face. He tried to fix the zombie’s face in his head, like removing the scars on his face and turning his eyes back normal. But still, he felt that he had never met such a person.</p> <p>While doing that, Lin Feng suddenly realized that the face that he pictured in his head was a woman’s face.</p> <p>But before the woman’s face faded in his mind, the zombie showed up again, and the cup in her hand was refilled with water.</p>",
  "Chapter 144: Three Cups of Water": "<p>After coming out of her space, Lin Qiao glanced at the few people squatting around Yuan Tianxing, then turned to find that her big brother was staring at her with a strange look. Lin Qiao knew that he was picturing something in his head, because that look on his face was very familiar to her.</p> <p>He was her big brother, and they grew up together. So, she clearly knew that the look in his face meant, not to mention how obvious it was.</p> <p>She looked at Lin Feng and figured that he might be imagining something about her. She didn’t mind, just turned to hand the cup of water to Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>“Should we give him more?” Du Yuanxing took over the cup and asked. Lin Qiao pointed at Lin Feng, then at the cup in his hand, then raised three clean fingers.</p> <p>Seeing that, Lin Feng asked without thinking, “Do you mean that you gave me three cups of water like this, and then I was cured?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at him.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing fixed his eyes on Lin Qiao’s hand and said, “Your hand is quite clean. Don’t all zombies have dirty hands, because of all the blood and dirt…”</p> <p>“Alright, just hand me the water first.” Lin Hao, who had been waiting for him to pass the water, couldn’t help but say out. Du Yuanxing hurriedly gave him the water.</p> <p>Lin Hao took over the water and started pouring it into Yuan Tianxing’s mouth. While doing that, he said, “I think this water is very helpful for healing Brother Tianxing’s internal injuries. It hasn’t shown any obvious effect on the trauma, but is still effective.”</p> <p>Hearing that, the others looked at Lin Hao with glowing eyes, then turned to Lin Qiao with surprise.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was looking at Lin Hao in astonishment. She was surprised that the latter was able to sense the energy in the lake water. Soon, she began wondering if her little brother had super sensations.</p> <p>Lin Hao poured the second cup of water into Yuan Tianxing’s mouth, then handed the cup to Lin Qiao without waiting for her to get it herself. Lin Qiao knowingly took two steps forward to get the cup, then stepped back and flashed into her space again.</p> <p>This time, the others didn’t step back to avoid her.</p> <p>“Granny,” Lin Xiaolu raised her head to look at Mrs. Lin and asked, “can his face be fixed?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin knew that she was talking about the zombie’s face. The little girl’s question made her begin wondering. Since the water could cure injuries, why didn’t the zombie fix his face with it? Or, was the water only effective on human beings?</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then replied to her granddaughter, “His body isn’t the same as ours. Perhaps, his face will recover in the future.”</p> <p>Hearing their conversation, the others had the same question as Mrs. Lin did. They too didn’t understand why the zombie didn’t heal himself with the water. Was it because he was a zombie?</p> <p>Lin Hao looked at them, knowing what they were thinking. Abruptly, he said, “He doesn’t have life-force. I think that’s why the energy contained in the water isn’t effective on him.”</p> <p>He turned to point at Yuan Tianxing, then continued, “The energy contained in the water has been restoring Brother Tianxing’s body very quickly, and stimulating his life force. Two cups of water aren’t enough for him. He needs another cup. After drinking the third cup of water, the energy in his body would be saturated, and then its effect won’t be so obvious.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin looked at him and asked, “Are you saying that Tianxing can only absorb the energy in three cups of water? Like, the fourth cup of water will be ineffective on him? Your brother recovered quite quickly, but why hasn’t Tianxing woken up yet?”</p> <p>“Do you remember how long did the zombie and my brother disappear just now?” Lin Hao spoke. “My brother was still unconscious when the zombie brought him out.”</p> <p>“The most important for now is for us to find a clean place to settle down as soon as possible. It’s getting dark soon. We need to find a shelter to hide from zombies before dark. Also, we need to let Tianxing get some good rest. Tomorrow, we’ll make some plan.” Lin Feng said.</p> <p>Hearing him, the others all nodded. Lin Wenwen looked at him and Cheng Wagnxue, then said, “You and Wangxue need to rest as well. I wonder if the zombie’s water can heal Wangxue’s foot.”</p> <p>While speaking, she fixed her eyes on Cheng Wangxue’s legs, who shook her head while smiling and said, “I’m fine.”</p> <p>“Yeah, it’s afternoon already.” Du Yuanxing agreed, “We should find a place to rest. We don’t need to worry about zombies though. As long as he and that young female zombie are with us, the others zombies won’t dare to approach.”</p> <p>He said that based on what he had experienced during the past few days. The other zombies all avoided them once seeing them.</p> <p>“Alright! Let’s wait for him to come out the. After Tianxing has taken the third cup of water, we’ll start looking for a place to get over this night… hem…” Lin Feng coughed while speaking.</p> <p>“Alright, Lin Feng, stop talking! We’ll do what you said. We’ll find a place to get over the night.” Maybe because he was talking too much, Lin Feng’s body seemed to be a little stressed. Noticing that, Mrs. Lin immediately interrupted him.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao showed up and handed Lin Hao the cup of water. After Lin Hao poured the water into Yuan Tianxing’s mouth, she took the cup back. Then, she flicked his hand, and the cup disappeared.</p> <p>“Eh… Lu Tianyu, right?” Du Yuanxing said to Lin Qiao, “We prepare to find a place to rest. I wonder if you have any recommendation.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was stepping back. Hearing Du Yuanxing’s words, she glanced at the group of people, then turned her head to sniff at the air. She didn’t catch any useful scent, so she turned around and walked to the tree nearby. From four or five meters away, she suddenly ran up and hopped onto the tree. After that, she stepped on the tree and leaped onto the building next to the tree.</p> <p>Watching her climbing onto the tall building like a nimble monkey, the others were amazed, feeling that it was so convenient for her to do that.</p> <p>Among the group of human beings, only Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing were capable of that. As level-six superpowered human beings, they were able to support their bodies with their powers and make themselves faster and nimbler; the others couldn’t do the same.</p> <p>After climbing onto the roof, Lin Qiao stood on the highest spot to look around at the surrounding buildings. They were at the edge of the city. This area wasn’t busy in the old world, but still had some large malls, supermarkets, and hotels.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a short while looking, then found a tall building two miles away. The signboard on that building was partially blown away by the wind, but was still recognizable as the signboard of a hotel.</p> <p>She glanced at the hotel, then immediately turned back to leap down from the top of the ten-story building, and landed on the ground like an agile cheetah.</p>",
  "Chapter 145: Leave Temporarily": "<p>After leaping off the building, Lin Qiao took out the notepad and wrote a few words, then raised a hand to point at the hotel. The others then read her note—’There’s <em>a hotel building.’</em></p> <p>“Hotel building? That will do. How far is it?” Asked Mrs. Lin. Lin Qiao showed her two fingers in response.</p> <p>The others glanced in that direction. They didn’t see any hotel building in a few hundreds of meters around them, so they guessed that it was two miles away from where they were.</p> <p>“Two miles?” Lin Hao tried confirming.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then habitually gave him a thumbs up. Lin Hao glanced at her thumb with a weird look, then turned to look at Lin Feng and Mrs. Lin and said, “It’s only two miles away. We can walk there.”</p> <p>“Jingchen, please carry Brother Tianxing.” Then, he suddenly shouted to one of the few soldiers who had been silently standing beside him. The tall and strong soldier named Wei Jingchen immediately wore his rifle to his chest, then rolled up his sleeves and walked over, squatting before Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>After that, the others helped Yuan Tianxing up and put him on Wei Jingchen’s back.</p> <p>Lin Qiao began moving toward the hotel building ahead of the others. In fact, she wanted to bring all of these people into her space, but it wasn’t the time to do that. These people weren’t familiar with her yet, so they definitely wouldn’t be willing to enter her space.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen walked to Cheng Wangxue, then said to Lin Feng, “Brother, I’ll hold my sister-in-law. You don’t look good. Are you feeling unwell?”</p> <p>Lin Feng didn’t reject her, but delightedly pushed his wife to his younger sister. After that, he slowly walked to the side. “I’m fine, don’t worry!” He said.</p> <p>“Is it fine for us to follow him?” At that moment, the leader of the group of soldiers came to Lin Hao’s side and asked, his hands holding his gun. Lin Hao looked at Lin Qiao’s back and responded, “I’m not sure either.”</p> <p>“It’s alright! He won’t hurt us,” Du Yuanxing came over and joined the conversation.</p> <p>“Why are you so sure?” Lin Hao looked at him and asked. Du Yuanxing chuckled, then narrowed his small eyes and replied, “Do you know what he eats?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Hao immediately stared at him with a weird look and said, “He’s a zombie. Doesn’t he eat human beings?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing shook his head and said, “No. He only eats animals, not human beings.”</p> <p>The other few people all looked at Du Yuanxing confusedly.</p> <p>“Isn’t he a zombie? I thought zombies only eat human beings. Can higher level zombies live on animals now?” Lin Hao asked with surprise.</p> <p>During the past few years, he and his families believed that zombies could upgrade only after eating human beings. They had never seen any zombie attack and eat animals.</p> <p>The scientists in their base had run experiments about that. They locked some ordinary zombies with living animals, but after days, those animals continued to be alive as those zombies ignored them. However, once human beings approached, those zombies would immediately burst in roars and try to pounce on them.</p> <p>All the bases had been trying during the past few years, but still, no one managed to figure out a way to resolve the zombie virus infection. People didn’t even know how the virus evolved, and how could it trigger superpowers.</p> <p>“That is something I don’t know for sure. But earlier on, I saw him hunt animals,” said Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen came closer and said, “How do you know he doesn’t eat human beings? Maybe he has eaten human beings but just didn’t let you see.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing paused slightly, then replied with confusion, “Yeah, that’s possible. But, I still believe that he won’t hurt human beings. At least, he has saved my life. He’s a good zombie!”</p> <p>The others felt a little speechless. ‘A good zombie? Really? Who knows what he got close to you for?’ Lin Wenwen thought.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing had no idea that the others felt that he was silly. He glanced at Yuan Tianxing who was carried on Wei Jingchen’s back and said, “So, why did Deputy Chief Yuan show up here? He was missing for a month, right? He was gone when the base was attacked.”</p> <p>Lin Hao glanced at Yuan Tianxing and thought of his condition. “Brother Tianxing has been injured for about a month,” he said, “and some of his injuries are new. I guess something happened to him while he was missing. He’s lucky that he’s still alive. He’s injured so badly, yet he still came for us. I wonder what he has been through.”</p> <p>“No wonder we couldn’t find him when the base was attacked,” said Long Qingying. “I guess he was attacked. After all, he has been at Chief’s side, and is keenly observant. He could have caused some hindrance for the enemies’ plan.”</p> <p>She was just making a guess, but little did she think that what she said had really happened.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was walking at the front while listening to their conversation. She was surprised that Yuan Tianxing had survived after the apocalypse, and had been with the other Lin Qiao, possessing a level-six superpower now. In Lin Qiao’s memories, he was never an ordinary man.</p> <p>She guessed that Yuan Tianxing’s earth power would be very useful when reconstructing buildings. Du Yuanxing’s power was rare as well. She didn’t understand why the base didn’t hire them as public officers. After all, their powers could be highly helpful for the base.</p> <p>While walking, the group of human beings suddenly discovered that all the surrounding ordinary zombies would automatically move away from Lin Qiao.</p> <p>That weird zombie was like a human-shaped zombie expeller!</p> <p>A while later, Lin Qiao stopped abruptly, then raised her head to look in another direction.</p> <p>“What’s wrong with him?” The people who followed behind her stopped as well. They kept a distance of about two meters from her while watching her moves confusedly.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao suddenly turned back, pointed where the hotel building was located, then made a few hand gestures quickly. After that, she turned back and hopped onto the roof of the two-story building next to her, leaping toward the area that she had looked at earlier on and disappearing soon.</p> <p>“He… seems to be an ex-special forces soldier.” Lin Feng said with a weird expression.</p> <p>“Brother, what did he mean?” Lin Wenwen and the other few who hadn’t spent their time in the army didn’t understand Lin Qiao’s hand gestures, so they looked at Lin Feng bewilderedly.</p> <p>Only Lin Feng and the few soldiers who didn’t have superpowers understood Lin Qiao’s meaning.</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at the area that Lin Qiao headed to, then looked at the hotel and said, “He told us to go to the hotel without him. The hotel is safe, and we can go over there without worry. He needs to leave for a second, but will meet us at the hotel very soon.”</p> <p>Hearing his words, Lin Wenwen and the others nodded. “Wow! Brother, you actually know what he meant.”</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at her and replied impatiently, “Have you forgotten what kind of job your sister and I did back in the old world?”</p> <p>While speaking, he kept moving toward the hotel.</p>",
  "Chapter 146: The Running Carp": "<p>Lin Wenwen nodded and said, “Ah, you used to be soldiers! Eh, do you mean that only soldiers use those gestures?”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and responded while walking, “That’s why I said he seems to be an ex-special forces soldier.”</p> <p>“But, why did he make those gestures only to you?” Du Yuanxing asked. “Does he know that you’ll understand them? In this case, he doesn’t need to write anymore. If he has something to say to us, he can simply say it to you by using hand gestures.”</p> <p>“I am also wondering why he knew that I could understand those gestures.” Lin Feng said.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing thought for a moment and said, “No wonder he said that he used to be your subordinate. It seems that he knows about you. That’s why he made those gestures only to you.”</p> <p>Lin Feng spent a while pondering, then nodded. Du Yuanxing’s words could be right.</p> <p>Then, Du Yuanxing asked another question, “But, why did he suddenly leave? What was he going to do? It seems that he has discovered something rather important just now.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and said, “I guess so. He’s a zombie, so his sensations are tens of times sharper than ours. I suppose that thing he discovered just now isn’t in this area, so he left temporarily.”</p> <p>“He left in such a haste. What on earth did he discover?” Du Yuanxing turned to where Lin Qiao disappeared and said.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After hopping on top of that building, Lin Qiao had darted in another direction. Soon, she made herself invisible and hid her vibe entirely.</p> <p>Once she turned invisible, no superpowered human being or zombie could discover her. The invisibility disabled her from attacking, but didn’t limit her from moving.</p> <p>She leaped faster across building tops. The buildings in this area weren’t tall; most of them had six to seven stories, while some small factory buildings only had three to five stories. Only the residential buildings were relatively taller, a few having over ten stories.</p> <p>Anyway, none of these building could slow Lin Qiao down. About twenty minutes later, she leaped across all the buildings and arrived at a large park. This park was about ten miles away from the hotel where Lin Feng and his people were heading to.</p> <p>Just now, she sensed something special from this park. That thing was very attractive to her.</p> <p>It was edible!</p> <p>When she arrived at this park, she found that all the plants in this place were thriving. The trees were incredibly huge, many reaching thirty or forty meters in height; some were even fifty to sixty meters tall.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked around the park and found its entrance. The building which had the name of this park carved on it was already wrapped in red fire vines, and the park name was no longer visible. Lin Qiao glanced at the building; in her eyes, these red vines were dark-grey, and all the other things were white or light-grey.</p> <p>She peered into the park and sniffed at it; then, she walked in.</p> <p>The small square behind the entrance was occupied by all sorts of strange mutant vines. Lin Qiao walked straight in, then took a side path. She needed to bend over to get through. If she didn’t, she would run into branches and vines.</p> <p>She kept moving forward. When she found the path blocked completely, she would pop her claws to cut off those branches and vines. After about ten minutes of walking and cutting, she finally walked out of the woods area and arrived at a lawn.</p> <p>The lawn was a tangle of overgrown weeds. In fact, there were many bugs in the weeds, and Lin Qiao could feel them. When she came through the woods just now, she had sensed some bugs as well. But, for an unknown reason, these bugs wouldn’t land on her body. A spider accidentally fell on her shoulder, but soon hopped away from her without lingering.</p> <p><em>‘Are these bugs afraid of zombies?’ </em>She wondered. She didn’t pay too much attention to those bugs, but walked to the lawn. She stood by the side of the woods to look at the other end of the lawn. A lake was located in that area, and the lake water was dark-green. Lin Qiao saw a strong virus energy in the lake, meaning that the lake was full of virus.</p> <p>Some creatures lived in that lake. Lin Qiao couldn’t tell what kind of monsters they were, but she guessed that those were some mutant aquatic animals.</p> <p>She sniffed at the air and sensed a strong fishy smell from the lake. But at the same time, she sensed something edible, and it was moving.</p> <p>Was it a fish? A mutant fish?</p> <p>She walked toward the lake. But on her way, she stopped abruptly, because she saw many fish skeletons among the grasses nearby. The flesh of those fishes had been eaten; only the spines and rotten fish heads remained, emitting a putrefactive odor.</p> <p>Many fish bodies had been dried by the sun, and the half-rotten fish heads had become dry as well. The lawn looked messy, and the grasses were pressed to the ground, as if something often crawled around.</p> <p>Before Lin Qiao figured out anything, her expression changed suddenly, and she immediately turned toward the lake.</p> <p>That was because something had come ashore.</p> <p>Looking at that creature which had come out of the water, Lin Qiao instantly felt speechless. Except for the four oddly shaped legs, the rest of its body looked exactly like a fish; it was a large carp. Normally, a carp could be one or two feet wide, but this one was seven or eight feet wide.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wondered how the four short and sturdy fish legs grew out of it.</p> <p>To answer that question, Lin Qiao even wanted to dissect this mutant fish.</p> <p>Before she saw that fish clearly, seven or eight footed fishes suddenly crawled out of the water and darted at her fleetingly. They were incredibly fast.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was about ten meters away from these fishes, but they only took a few seconds to run past Lin Qiao’s feet.</p> <p>Lin Qiao automatically jumped to the side, as she was worried that those fishes might bump into her feet. However, the fishes didn’t touch her feet. Maybe because they were sensitive, they even avoided her feet.</p> <p>These fishes brought up a wave of fishy smell that made Lin Qiao cover her nose with a hand. That smell was just too awful.</p> <p>Right at that moment, some other noises were heard from the lake surface, followed by a series of water sloshing sounds. Lin Qiao turned back to the lake and saw a group of turtles rushing up.</p> <p>Indeed, they rushed up! Their shells looked heavy and thick, yet they swiftly chased after those running fishes. They were much faster than those weird fishes.</p>",
  "Chapter 147: Caught Large Turtles": "<p>Lin Qiao immediately raised a hand to take off her sunglasses, then watched the thirty or forty turtles, which were even faster than rabbits, run past her feet.</p> <p>Each of these turtles was as large as a washbowl. While running, they pressed the thirty to forty centimeters tall grasses to the ground. The edible thing which attracted her here were precisely these fleetingly running turtles.</p> <p>Those fishes were outnumbered by these swift turtles. Before they reached the woods, these turtles had caught up with them and pounced on them. Each fish was targeted by a few turtles. The turtles widely opened their mouths and pierced their weird-looking sharp teeth into those fishes’ bodies.</p> <p>Those fishes had thick scales. Lin Qiao could tell that their scales were especially hard, maybe because they often ran on the ground. However, under these turtles’ teeth, these scales seemed to be totally useless. The fish scales were crushed by the turtles, and the fish blood splashed everywhere. Soon, the turtles tore the fishes into pieces.</p> <p>Seeing those footed fishes struggle under the turtle teeth, Lin Qiao even felt their pain!</p> <p>The fishes were large in size, yet not a single fish managed to survive the group attack from a couple of turtles. Besides, these fishes weren’t much different from the fishes back in the old world, except for their legs. On the other hand, the turtles had shiny sharp teeth which would make anyone afraid. Being bitten by these turtles must hurt like hell.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched the turtles tear the fishes. They were like a bunch of starving wild dogs which had finally found something to eat. They were so fierce that they fought each other even while eating. From time to time, they would turn their heads to bite the other turtles.</p> <p>Before long, the few fishes were eaten up, with only their heads and bloody spines remaining. Even their feet were dragged away and chewed up by some turtles.</p> <p>Lin Qiao witnessed the whole thing from the beginning to the end, which only took nearly five minutes. <em>‘Oh well, now I know why there’re so many fish bones. It just happened right in front of me!’ </em>She thought.</p> <p>She looked at those turtles which had still been lingering around the fish bones. The eight large footed fishes weighed twenty kilograms each at the very least, yet they were swallowed by these ferocious and crazy turtles so quickly. Moreover, the scent of these scary turtles was actually attracting her.</p> <p>Should she kill and eat these turtles?</p> <p>Seeing that some turtles began drawing back toward the lake, Lin Qiao immediately showed her face and stepped on the shell of the turtle which was moving past her feet.</p> <p>The turtle which was trampled by her was startled, and automatically began struggling hard.</p> <p>The turtle had an incredible strength. Lin Qiao felt that she was stepping on a large dog. However, the turtle shell helped her. She pressed her foot down and pressed the turtle to the ground. The turtle struggled to stand up but couldn’t, no matter how hard it tried.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s strength was greater than that of a bull, and the turtle was just a turtle.</p> <p>While struggling, the turtle turned its head back to try and bite the foot which was stepping on its shell. However, as its neck wasn’t long enough, its teeth couldn’t even touch Lin Qiao’s feet.</p> <p>Lin Qiao bent over and gripped the edge of its shell. Then, she suddenly lifted her foot and upturned the turtle, making it fall down on its back with legs pointing up.</p> <p>As this turtle was swinging its limbs to try and turn itself over, Lin Qiao glanced at the other turtles and found that they were all drawing back into the water.</p> <p>The turtle she caught might have released some kind of danger signal that made the other turtles run. The other turtles swiftly darted back to the lake, and soon jumped into the water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao immediately caught up with the turtle which was left behind. Just like how she caught the first one, she stepped on its shell and then quickly turned it over. After that, she went for the third one.</p> <p>These turtles weren’t as fast as she was, but still, most of them managed to escape. Lin Qiao moved as quickly as she could and managed to turn seven turtles over.</p> <p>Looking at the seven turtles which were rocking on the ground without being able to turn over, Lin Qiao walked toward the relatively larger one. She squatted beside the wash-basin-sized turtle, watching it struggle.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao approached, that turtle glared at her fiercely. It bared its teeth and reached its head toward her, seeming ready to attack her.  <em>‘Do you still want to attack me? Wait to see how I kill you!’ Lin Qiao thought. </em></p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at this feral turtle and abruptly gave a smile. Then, she reached out a hand, popped her sharp claws, and swung at the turtle’s head.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>The teeth-baring turtle’s head was cut off cleanly by her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took in a deep breath when sensing the refreshing scent of the turtle’s blood and flesh and bones, then began chopping it up. Her claws could even cut stone walls, let alone a turtle. She reached out her forefinger, put her fingernail on one side of the turtle’s body, then cut directly toward the tail.</p> <p>Squeak!</p> <p>Her fingernail brushed against the turtle shell and produced a shrill noise.</p> <p>She drew a line on the turtle’s body. In fact, the turtle shell had already been cut open by her. At the moment, as long as she split the turtle shell, the turtle’s flesh would be exposed.</p> <p>When she tore the turtle shell into two, a white figure suddenly showed up on the lawn.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quickly glanced at Qiu Lili who appeared abruptly, then dropped her head to look at the turtle which was already split in two. After that, she began digging its internal organs and chewing its flesh.</p> <p>Qiu Lili’s red eyes were wide open. She was pouting and wearing an angry look, but at the sight of the few large turtles which were lying on their back and struggling, she immediately came over with curiosity.</p> <p>She was chasing after Yang Jianhua, but failed to catch him. The latter had hidden in a certain way, and she couldn’t find him any longer. She wasn’t willing to give up, but still, she decided to come back and find Lin Qiao.</p> <p>She found that Lin Qiao was in this lakeside park alone, so she came as well. After arriving, she saw a few turtles lying on their backs while Lin Qiao was cutting up one of them.</p> <p>At last, Qiu Lili squatted by the smallest turtle to spin it with her hand. While making the turtle spin like a top, she watched Lin Qiao take out a sharp and exquisite dagger to cut the turtle meat for eating.</p>",
  "Chapter 148: Kick The Turtle Like A Ball": "<p>Lin Qiao cut the turtle meat into small pieces with the dagger, then sent it into her mouth with the dagger tip to eat. While eating, she considered what to do with the other turtles that she had caught. She didn’t want to release them, neither was she able to eat them all.</p> <p>She wondered if she could keep them in the lake in her space. Would the vines in the lake catch and drain these turtles? The energy in the lake should be harmless to these turtles, so the vines were the only thing to worry about.</p> <p>However, the vines seemed to want nothing but energy. These mutant turtles were large, but hadn’t been releasing any energy waves. So, Lin Qiao guessed that these turtles didn’t have energy nuclei. But still, she couldn’t tell if the vines would be interested in them or not.</p> <p>While eating, she saw the small spinning turtle before Qiu Lili and suddenly had an idea.</p> <p><em>‘Maybe I should put one of these turtles in the lake first, and see what’ll happen,’ </em>she thought.</p> <p>While thinking, she glanced at the other turtles, then continued eating.</p> <p>Watching her eating with appetite, Qiu Lili stood up and curiously walked over. Qiu Lili also fed on animals, but she never liked the taste. For this reason, she would only eat animals once in a blue moon to replenish the energy of her body, or, she would kill a few level four or five zombies and absorb their zombie nuclei. She didn’t want to eat human beings, even though they smelled delicious.</p> <p>As Qiu Lili came over, Lin Qiao cut off a piece of turtle meat and handed it to her with the dagger.</p> <p>Qiu Lili squatted behind her, arms crossed before her chest. She leaned her head forward to sniff at the turtle meat, then slightly twisted her delicate eyebrows. But still, she opened her mouth to bite the piece of meat.</p> <p>After biting the meat, she frowned even harder. As she chewed the meat, it made her pause and knit her brows. Looking at her struggling expression, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but smile.</p> <p>Qiu Lili glanced at her frowningly. She wanted to spit the turtle meat out, but as Lin Qiao was laughing at her, she chewed it for a few more times, then forced herself to swallow it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with a smile. <em>‘Is it really so bad? Look at your face…’ </em>she said to Qiu Lili with her eyes.</p> <p>After swallowing the meat, Qiu Lili left the other half of the piece of meat on Lin Qiao’s dagger tip and stood up. She then turned and walked back to that relatively smaller turtle which had just stopped spinning, and began playing with it again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched her go away, then looked at the half piece of meat on her dagger tip. She put the meat into her own mouth, as she didn’t want to waste it. It might be a little gross as it had Qiu Lili’s saliva on it, but Lin Qiao didn’t mind. Back in the old world, she and her soldier friends often shared foods like this during missions. None of them would feel disgusted.</p> <p>She was a zombie now, so she didn’t need to be afraid of the virus contained in Qiu Lili’s saliva.</p> <p>She quickly finished this turtle, then threw away the shell. After that, she wiped her mouth with her sleeve and stood up, putting the dagger away.</p> <p>She walked to another turtle and grabbed its tail. Then, both she and the turtle disappeared. Qiu Lili glanced at where she disappeared, then continued spinning her turtle.</p> <p>After bringing the turtle into her space, Lin Qiao directly threw it into the lake.</p> <p>Plop!</p> <p>The turtle fell into the water, then immediately began swimming toward the deeper area.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was able to sense the turtle and its movements. However, she couldn’t sense those vines. Only when she vines showed up could she see them.</p> <p>Soon, she found the turtle swimming happily in the lake.</p> <p>She waited for a while, but nothing happened in the lake. <em>‘Are those vines really not interested in the turtle?’ </em>She began wondering with hesitation, <em>‘No vine is showing up. Maybe they’ll come out later.’</em></p> <p>As she was thinking if the vines would leave the turtle alone, something was suddenly sensed from the bottom of the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought that what she had been worrying about was now happening. Then, she sensed that the turtle had stopped moving, as if it was wrapped up by something. She knew that the vines had made their move.</p> <p>Before she began wondering if the vines would absorb the turtle, she saw a thing being thrown out of the lake.</p> <p>The turtle was thrown out of the middle of the lake, and was flying toward Lin Qiao speedily.</p> <p>Seeing that, Lin Qiao honestly didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>She glanced at the vine which had stuck out of the water surface while throwing out the turtle. But soon, the vine drew back into the lake.</p> <p>She guessed that the vines didn’t like the turtle.</p> <p>The turtle thudded against the ground next to Lin Qiao’s feet. It had nearly fainted, and didn’t realize what was happening. In order to confirm her thought, Lin Qiao suddenly raised a foot and kicked the turtle back into the lake like a ball.</p> <p>Plop!</p> <p>The turtle drew an arc in the sky, then fell back into the lake. As Lin Qiao expected, the turtle was thrown back out within a minute.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Is the vine conscious!’ </em>Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>She looked at the turtle which had flown back to her and thought for a moment, then once again kicked the poor turtle back into the lake.</p> <p>Ten seconds later, the turtle flew back to her. Lin Qiao wanted to laugh at this point. She turned to look at the center of the lake and saw the vines which had stuck out of the water. This time, they didn’t draw back into the water, but were hitting the water surface, generating a series of clattering sound of water.</p> <p><em>‘They’re mad! Haha!’</em></p> <p>As the vines were finally pissed off by what she had done, Lin Qiao laughed out loud. At the same time, she sensed a strong discontentment from the vines.</p> <p>Then, she turned to the turtle which was already too weak to make any reaction, and after that, she looked around. On doing that, she saw Junjun standing by the entrance of the small space, looking at her bewilderedly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao lowered her head and turned her eyes back to the turtle which was disliked by the vines. As the vines refused to let this turtle be in the lake, they definitely wouldn’t let the other turtles go down into the lake either.</p> <p>Should she put those turtles on the grassland? Lin Qiao looked at those strawberry plants and vegetables while thinking. Junjun had been taking good care of those plants, but these fast-running turtles would certainly destroy them.</p> <p>What could she do with those turtles? These turtles weren’t as harmless as those baby mice and the rabbit which were hiding among the grasses now. They weighed tens of kilograms, and could destroy those vegetables by simply stepping on them; not to mention the fact that these turtles had sharp teeth.</p>",
  "Chapter 149: Wild Giant Vine": "<p>As Lin Qiao finally stopped kicking the turtle back into the lake, the vines slowly calmed down, then drew back in and sank down. Lin Qiao looked at the turtle, thinking about how to keep it in the space alive. She shouldn’t kill all those turtles and keep the meat in buckets like she did with the snake, should she?</p> <p>Before she could figure out a solution for the turtles, she suddenly sensed a wave of energy from the outside, and then heard Qiu Lili’s scream.</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao left the nearly unconscious turtle and directly flashed out of her space.</p> <p>Once out, she saw tens of human-arm-thick vines reaching out of the woods. She couldn’t see the color of the vines, but as they were dark gray in her eyes, she figured that they were all deeply-colored. These huge vines were covered in small and sharp thorns and many leaves.</p> <p>About twenty or thirty vines had reached out of the woods toward the lake. These vines danced in the air while wriggling toward the few large turtles which were turned over by Lin Qiao earlier.</p> <p>At that time, Qiu Lili was angrily staring at those vines which came for the turtles. She cut off every single vine which had approached her.</p> <p>Sticky liquid flowed out of the vines which were cut off. The broken vines soon drew back, but more and more of them had been darting out of the woods, toward the turtles.</p> <p><em>‘What the hell is this? Another conscious vine?’ </em>Lin Qiao thought. Looking at the vines before her, she compared them with the vines inside the lake in her space and felt the latter to be much prettier.</p> <p>“Ah!”<br/>\n‘They’re coming for the turtles!’ As Lin Qiao showed up, Qiu Lili immediately roared at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao fixed her eyes on these fiercely wriggling vines and suddenly sensed waves of energy from them. It was a strange kind of energy, which wasn’t like the energy of zombies or the energy of superpowered human beings. It was a special type of energy.</p> <p>Was it the energy of mutant plants? It seemed that this vine already had a nucleus!</p> <p>With that thought, Lin Qiao gave Qiu Lili a roar. ‘Wait here, I’ll go take a look,’ she said.</p> <p>After that, she made herself invisible, bypassed these vines, and walked toward the woods.</p> <p>The vines ignored the invisible Lin Qiao and rushed toward Qiu Lili. Qiu Lili was incredibly fast, so dealing with these vines was a piece of cake for her.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s roar, she understood that Lin Qiao was probably going to deal with the main body of these vines. So, she waited there while playing with the vines which just wouldn’t give up on approaching those turtles.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked into the woods along with these vines and soon found their main body. It was only about ten meters away from the lawn by the lakeside. That area was covered by nothing but vines.</p> <p>In the middle of the vines, was a large, fruit-like thing, which was surrounded by a few strange plants.</p> <p>These plants didn’t look like parts of the vine plant. They were another kind of plant, growing on the vine. They looked a little like pitcher plants, because they had large bags covered by leaves.</p> <p>Their leaves had thick and hard thorns on the edges. At the moment, the few bags of the pitcher plant had been uncovered, exposing their interiors.</p> <p>There were three bags, each guarding a side of the fruit. The openings of the bags were facing the outside, as if the pitcher plants were protecting the fruit.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed that the energy was coming from the fruit. It seemed that there was a nucleus inside it.</p> <p>Apart from the energy, Lin Qiao had also sensed a tempting aroma from the pitcher plants’ bags. However, she didn’t like the aroma, because it felt unreal.</p> <p>Before the apocalypse, these kinds of plants would emit a certain type of scent to attract some insects or small animals into their bags. Then, they’d cover the bags to trap their preys and secrete a digestive juice to digest them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gently stepped onto the thick vines and leaped toward the center.</p> <p>The vines under her feet all paused for a few seconds, maybe cause they had sensed Lin Qiao’s weight, but didn’t sense her vibe.</p> <p>The vines in this area were as thick as Lin Qiao’s thighs, and their thorns were very sharp and large. Lin Qiao needed to put her foot between the thorns while walking on the vines.</p> <p>While walking, she popped both her claws. She didn’t bring any powerful fire source, so she figured that she should conveniently cut the vine with her claws.</p> <p>When she sneakily approached the center of the vines, the aroma became stronger.</p> <p>She leaned her head forward to look into the pitcher plant’s bags, and saw the bodies of many rats, some birds, and bugs.</p> <p>The bags weren’t large, and were swinging. She didn’t understand why these two types of plants would be together, and how they could benefit each other.</p> <p>However, as the openings of the bags were only as big as the screen of a regular sized laptop, those turtles wouldn’t fit in; not to mention the fact that these pitcher plants could never digest the turtle shells.</p> <p>In this case, why would the vine want those turtles?</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked around, then fixed her eyes on the ends of the vines. Surprisingly, she found the bodies of some other animals, mostly cats and dogs. Those dead animals were pressed under the vines, so she didn’t see them earlier. But now, she found that there were quite a lot of dead animals. Afterward, she checked the other two bags of the pitcher plants and found some dead kittens.</p> <p>The strange thing was that the dead animals under the vines and in the bags were all drained. Lin Qiao didn’t even sense the stink of corpses from them.</p> <p>The animals in the pitcher plants’ bags were digested to a greater extent. Except for the bones, all other parts of these animals had been absorbed. Unlike them, the dead animals under the vines were simply drained of blood and moisture, turning twisted and dry.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gently walked over to a pitcher plant and observed the fruit. The fruit wasn’t large, only at the size of a man’s fist. It looked a little like a persimmon, with a short stem.</p> <p>Lin Qiao popped her claws. She didn’t know if these pitcher plants were fierce or not. But, judging from the dead animals in their bags, they should be quite hard to deal with.</p> <p>She reached out her pair of claws, flashed into her space, and came out immediately. Then, she swiftly cut at the joints of the pitcher plants’ bags and the fruit.</p>",
  "Chapter 150: The Fruit Of The Vines": "<p>Following a series of swishing noise, Lin Qiao cut off the three large bags and the fruit. As the fruit was falling to the ground, she hurriedly bent over and caught it with her hand, then quickly entered her space.</p> <p>The pitcher plants’ bags automatically covered their openings while falling on the ground.</p> <p>All the vines paused when the fruit was cut off, and then began wriggling intensely. A loud rustling noise could be heard from the surrounding plants as the plants which had reached out all drew back, brandishing on this area and whipping at the surrounding plants over and over again.</p> <p>Stirred by these vines, the grass pieces and dust rose in clouds, and the earth shook fiercely.</p> <p>The movements of the vines startled all the birds on the surrounding trees, making them flap their wings and fly up into the sky as they left this area as quickly as possible.</p> <p>But soon, the vines slowed down and fell softly to the ground, as if they had lost their strength. A couple minutes later, they stopped moving completely.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t care what happened out there. After entering the space with the strange fruit, she sat down on a chair beside the lake. Next to the chair was the stone stove that she built to cook for the little boy.</p> <p>The chair that she was sitting on was carried here by Junjun. Junjun sometimes put the little boy on this chair while she was cooking for him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know the little boy’s name yet, because not even Junjun remembered it. Hence, Junjun gave the little boy a new name—Tongtong.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put the fruit before her eyes to look at it. She found some sticky liquid flowing out of the broken stem of the fruit, the same as the liquid from the vines.</p> <p>She looked at the fruit carefully, then pinched it. It was hard, not looking edible at all. However, it was indeed filled with a great amount of energy. However, Lin Qiao couldn’t tell if it contained a crystal-like nucleus,</p> <p>She popped a fingernail to cut the fruit from top to bottom, then from bottom to top. After that, she gripped both sides of the fruit and forced it apart.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>Once the fruit was broken, a strong wave of energy flushed out, right toward Lin Qiao’s face.</p> <p>She automatically turned her head to dodge it.</p> <p>Then, she looked into the fruit and found a thumb-sized white kernel, having a smooth, hard skin. What wrapped that kernel wasn’t pulp, but a thick, very hard shell. Lin Qiao believed that not even a hammer could open this fruit.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked the kernel out with the top of her fingernail, not noticing that a long and dark figure in the lake had swum toward her, and that a small green vine had stuck out of the water at the shoreside.</p> <p>The vine reached to Lin Qiao’s feet. Right when she picked out the white kernel, the vine poked her foot with its end.</p> <p><em>‘Eh?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that something was poking her foot as she prepared to try figuring out how to absorb the energy inside the kernel. She lowered her head and found that a familiar-looking vine had crawled to her feet.</p> <p><em>‘The vine plant here is really conscious!’ </em>She thought.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao noticed it, the vine immediately rose and pointed at the kernel in her hand.</p> <p>Lin Qiao naughtily moved her hand away. As she thought, the vine paused slightly, then followed her hand to the side. After that, she moved her hand back, and so did the vine. As she kept moving her hand, the vine never gave up on following, as if it had to touch the kernel.</p> <p><em>‘Do you want it so much?’ </em>Lin Qiao suddenly felt that the vine was like a child asking for candies. She stared at it, wanting to laugh.</p> <p>The vine stopped moving abruptly, maybe because it had sensed Lin Qiao’s thought. It stood straight before her eyes for a while, then reached to her hand and slowly coiled around her wrist.</p> <p><em>‘I want energy! Upgrade!’</em></p> <p>By touching the vine, Lin Qiao received a message.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Can this help you upgrade?’ Lin Qiao thought. ‘I can’t absorb the energy in this kernel, but if I offer it to this vine plant, it might be happy. Perhaps, it’ll give me another treatment.’</em></p> <p>With that thought, Lin Qiao handed the white kernel to the vine, which immediately wrapped the kernel up and quickly dragged it into the water.</p> <p>Seeing the vine draw back into the lake with the kernel, Lin Qiao stood up and walked to the lakeside to try sensing something. As she had expected, she soon sensed a wave of energy vibration from the lake bottom.</p> <p>After waiting for another while, she suddenly recalled that turtle which she had brought in earlier.</p> <p>She turned to where she had left the turtle, but found that it was gone.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Where did it go?’</em></p> <p>…</p> <p>Outside, Qiu Lili was having fun with those vines. But suddenly, she saw those vines pause, then all draw back, leaving her with the turtles. She guessed that Lin Qiao had done something to the vine plant to make all the vines draw back.</p> <p>Not long after the vines drew back into the woods, she heard a loud series of noise from that area.</p> <p>She didn’t know what happened, but she heard the vines whipping at the ground and the surrounding plants, also the startled birds flying and animals running.</p> <p>The noises lasted for a short while, then slowly faded. Soon, that area quieted down again.</p> <p>Qiu Lili waited for a while, but the vines never came out again. So, she squatted to continue playing with the turtles, because Lin Qiao hadn’t come back.</p> <p>Later on, she raised her head to look at the sky. The sun was setting, but she didn’t know when Lin Qiao would come back. Without any other choice, she stayed here and kept guarding these turtles.</p> <p>The bored Qiu Lili spun one turtle, then went to spin another one before the first one stopped spinning, and then the third and the fourth one.</p> <p>As the first one was about to stop, she went back to spin it again.</p> <p>Soon, she began enjoying this turtle-spinning game alone. This time, she wasn’t spinning only one turtle, but all of them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had caught and turned over seven turtles, but only five were left on the lawn now, as one was eaten by her and another one was taken into her space.</p>",
  "Chapter 151: The Space Is Upgrading": "<p>Lin Qiao was looking for the turtle in her space. It couldn’t be in the water, so she looked around and figured that it was hiding among the grasses.</p> <p>She closed her eyes to listen to the sounds in her space carefully, then sniffed at the air. After that, she walked to the grass.</p> <p>She hadn’t been taking care of the strawberry plants and vegetables in her space for a while. It was Junjun who had been doing the job.</p> <p>While walking toward the strawberry filed, she suddenly began wondering how those baby mice had been. She guessed that those mice would often come to eat her strawberries. That gray rabbit loved the strawberries as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that Junjun would come to this area frequently to drive away the few mice and the rabbit. She kept those small animals in her space as stored food, but now, they were living here quite happily.</p> <p>That rabbit had somehow become Wu Yueling’s friend, so Lin Qiao decided not to eat it. As for the few mice, she planned to wait for them to grow up and then eat them.</p> <p>Following the scent of the turtle, Lin Qiao gently walked into the grasses.<br/>\nShe walked toward the turtle with light footsteps, then found that it had moved to the edge between the grassland and the white fog.</p> <p>Was the turtle trying to get out of her space?</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently walked over, looking at the turtle which had been circling by the white fog, seemingly trying to find an exit.</p> <p>The turtle sensed her immediately. As it turned back and saw Lin Qiao standing behind it, it immediately hid its head and limbs in its shell.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the turtle which was already freaked out by the vine plant in her lake and felt like laughing. She instantly squatted and turned the turtle over.</p> <p>As she was thinking about how to deal with this turtle and the few outside, she suddenly sensed that something was summoning her to the center of the lake. It was similar to when she was summoned down to the lake for the first time.</p> <p>But this time, her mind continued to be clear.</p> <p>She stood up and walked toward the lake. She didn’t notice that as she turned to leave, the white fog behind her was moving backward slowly, exposing some tall and dark shadows.</p> <p>Those were like the shadows of trees that people might see in dark nights.</p> <p>As the white fog faded, some trees really appeared. These trees were all dark in color, with luxuriant foliage, about ten meters in height. The white fog on this side kept moving backward, and so did it on the other side, by the side of the lake.</p> <p>The small space that Junjun and the little boy stayed in didn’t disappear, but began moving backward.</p> <p>While playing with Tongtong in the small space, Junjun suddenly sensed a light above her head. Then, she raised her head to find that she was out of the small space. However, she didn’t remember coming outside.</p> <p>After that, she looked around and found something even stranger. Not only her, but the bed and other things were all out here as well.</p> <p>She turned back and realized that the small space was moving itself away.</p> <p>She didn’t move her feet, and suddenly felt that this space had become much larger than before.</p> <p>She then carefully looked at the small space and found that it was still moving!</p> <p>With surprise, she glanced at the surrounding white fog. She saw that the wall of the white fog was expanding, and also noticed those newly appeared trees by the edge of the grassland.</p> <p><em>‘What… What’s going on? Did Lin Qiao do something to her space?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>She turned to Lin Qiao, who was by the lakeside, and saw that the latter was taking off her clothes. So, she hurriedly covered the little boy’s eyes.</p> <p><em>‘Don’t look!’</em></p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao had walked to the lakeside and taken off her jacket. Then, she turned back to glance at Junjun. Only after finding that the latter had covered Tongtong’s eyes did she take off all her clothes without worry.</p> <p>Afterward, Lin Qiao walked into the lake naked. Once she got into the water, something quickly coiled around her feet to gently drag her down.</p> <p>She lowered her head and found that it was a vine.</p> <p>Being dragged by the vine, she walked slowly into the lake. When the water reached her chest, she dove into the water and moved toward the bottom of the lake.</p> <p>Once she was submerged into the water, she found that the energy down in the lake was stronger than before by many times; the glowing green energy had become much darker in color.</p> <p>She was a little surprised. Looking at the dark green energy, she wondered if it were the kernel which had strengthened it.</p> <p>Before she arrived at the lake center, a few more vines reached to her and coiled around her waist and limbs. Then, the vines dragged her quickly down to the lake bottom. During that process, more vines had reached to her and coiled around her.</p> <p>By the time her feet touched the lake bottom, she was already wrapped into a green cocoon. She sensed that familiar numb and itchy feeling from her entire body again.</p> <p><em>‘Can you remove the scar on my face? I hope my face can be fixed this time! Please fix my face first!’</em></p> <p>While enduring that awful headache, Lin Qiao murmured in her heart. She couldn’t tell for sure if the vine plant was able to sense her thoughts or not.</p> <p>When she started to sense waves of dull pain from her brain, she took a deep breath to make herself ready.</p> <p>As she had expected, the dull pain soon exploded in her brain.</p> <p><em>‘It hurts!’ </em>She gritted her teeth and closed her eyes, hands clenched into fists and whole body tightened. The vines were as strong as always. They wrapped her tightly without letting her move even an inch.</p> <p>The pain in her head grew greater and greater. She clenched her teeth so tightly that she even felt that her teeth were going to be crushed. But still, she didn’t open her mouth to scream.</p> <p><em>‘Deep breath! Deep breath!’</em></p> <p>At that moment, her brain received a message, and she automatically took in a deep breath.</p> <p>Suddenly, she felt a large amount of energy flushing into her brain through her nose. However, that energy didn’t ease her pain, but caused something to burst.</p> <p>The head-blowing pain that she had been suffering was upgraded, turning into a horribly hot and swelling feeling in her head. She felt that her head wasn’t exploding anymore, and instead, it was forced to expand by something. She now felt that her head was larger than before by a few times.</p> <p>That painful feeling lingered in her head. Her mind was clear, but she would rather pass out and then wake up to find that it was over.</p> <p>However, once her mind became a little bit blur, she was woken up by that immense pain.</p>",
  "Chapter 152: Heal Again": "<p>The same thing happened over and over again; Lin Qiao didn’t know how long did it take for her to feel numb again.</p> <p>All of a sudden, her whole body began shaking. Next, a scorching hot feeling attacked her brain.</p> <p>As a zombie, she couldn’t sense temperatures. But this time, she felt that her brain was burning hot, as if her head had become a stove, and was baking her entire brain.</p> <p>Her body was almost occupied by numbness, so she was prepared for this. Her face twisted as she couldn’t help but scream out loud.</p> <p>“Roar!” Her voice arose from the bottom of the lake, rippling the water.</p> <p>After that roar, she felt that her head had truly exploded this time. The explosive pain threw her into unconsciousness.</p> <p>She finally passed out.</p> <p>Junjun, who was curiously watching the space expanding, didn’t hear Lin Qiao’s roar, but sensed it clearly. She turned to look at the lake and found that the water surface was rippling quietly.</p> <p>She didn’t know what Lin Qiao went down in the lake to do. The lake made her feel dangerous, so she didn’t dare to go down there.</p> <p>At that moment, the body of the unconscious Lin Qiao had been changing slowly as she had wished. The dark green energy contained in the lake water had been drilling into her body, especially the scarred parts.</p> <p>The wounds on her arms and legs had all been healed. Except for the odd skin color and the stiff muscles, her limbs now looked exactly like those of normal people.</p> <p>A great amount of energy flowed into her stomach, circled in her body, and then gathered in her brain. The energy quickly activated the dead cells of her body, then filled them up. However, the growth of the cells was a very slow process, especially in her hollowed stomach.</p> <p>While activating Lin Qiao’s dead cells, the energy had also been removing the scars on her face as quickly as possible.</p> <p>And of course, her breasts were being fixed as well.</p> <p>Down at the bottom of the lake, under the roots of the vine plant, a dark light spot had been sparkling. Every time it sparkled, a wave of dark green energy would be released. Most of the energy had been sent into Lin Qiao’s body through those vines, gathering in her brain.</p> <p>Nobody knew about that, and the unconscious Lin Qiao surely had no way of finding out about it.</p> <p>The scars on her face had been changing bit by bit. A new layer of flesh was growing under her scars, while a strange membrane grew out on her stomach and covered the gaping wound there.</p> <p>While the energy was fixing Lin Qiao’s body, Qiu Lili was waiting by the lake outside, feeling very bored. She waited for quite a while, but Lin Qiao never showed up. She didn’t plan on leaving without Lin Qiao, so she kept squatting by the lake and spinning turtles.</p> <p>The five turtles had been dizzied by her, and were all hiding in their shells.</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Feng and his people arrived at the hotel building, which had forty or fifty stories, after a short walk. As Lin Qiao wasn’t with them, the zombies in the hotel building sensed their scents and all rushed out, pouncing on them while roaring.</p> <p>The two level-six superpowered ones in the team weren’t able to fight, so the others needed to deal with those zombies.</p> <p>The four female members were shielded by the others. Among the four, Cheng Wangxue was the strongest one. However, her leg was broken by Yang Jianhua’s ice blade earlier on, so she had difficulty moving now.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen didn’t have much fighting capacity. Same as Lin Qiao, she had space power. Before the apocalypse, she was just a college student, so she didn’t know how to fight at all. After the apocalypse, she had learned how to use guns under the dangerous circumstances, and her reaction capacity was improved largely. But still, she wasn’t a fighter.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin and the little girl were both ordinary human beings. Lin Hao wasn’t a strong fighter either, but his sensations were very sharp.</p> <p>Therefore, except for Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying, the others were all holding their guns to blow the head of any zombie that crossed their eyes.</p> <p>They had all mastered marksmanship, which allowed them to shoot the enemies quickly and accurately. In the post-apocalyptic era, they were forced to learn some skills.</p> <p>However, the few soldiers who had been protecting Lin Feng and his family all the way were all real soldiers. Otherwise, they wouldn’t follow the Lin Family all the way here from the Zhe Province. During the journey, many of their friends had died. Those people weren’t killed by zombies, but by Yang Jianhua and his people.</p> <p>The hotel building was located in the middle of the city. Therefore, it was filled and surrounded by zombies. As a group of living human beings had shown up, those slow-moving zombies all gathered toward this area excitedly, baring their teeth and waving their claws, trying to pounce on Lin Feng and his people and bite them.</p> <p>However, before they could approach those human beings, their heads were blown up.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing released electricity from both his hands to strike the zombies, making them shake and then freeze. Those zombies weren’t dead, but were temporarily disabled from moving. Soon, the electricity faded and they started moving again.</p> <p>As usual, Long Qingying gathered the metal objects around her to forge small weapons like metal thorns, then sent them out to penetrate the heads of the zombies which were approaching.</p> <p>After that, she would reclaim those metal weapons to prepare for the next round of attack.</p> <p>With Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing’ large-scale attack, the group entered the hotel building quite quickly and conveniently. They even had the time to chat during this.</p> <p>“Where did that zombie go? It has been so long.”</p> <p>“Who knows! This hotel looks huge. Look at the lobby… it seems that no other human beings have come here. Later on, we should try finding freezers and other storages. Let’s see if we can find some expired food here.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir.”</p> <p>Even though five years had passed since the apocalypse, people could still find some packaged foods which were produced before the old world ended. Many vacuumed or sealed food such as canned food or dried food could be preserved for more than five years.</p> <p>Places like grand hotels, large restaurants, or fancy clubs were likely to store sealed foods. As for whether those foods had gone bad or not, that would depend on their luck.</p> <p>Some cold storages could maintain a low temperature for a long time even after the power outage. After the apocalypse, the daytime was hot, but the nighttime was cold. Without being exposed to direct sunlight, the ice wouldn’t melt easily. Therefore, some sealed cold storage houses still had lots of ice in them.</p>",
  "Chapter 153: Become Bald": "<p>The group of people entered the hotel through the lobby and found that the zombies in the building hadn’t been cleared out. The furnishing in the building was a little messy, but not damaged. Many things remained, albeit covered in a thick layer of dust.</p> <p>“This hotel is huge. I can’t believe nobody has come to collect these useful things. The Sea City Base isn’t far away. Hadn’t those people discovered this place? Hadn’t they searched this area yet?” Du Yuanxing asked. They were located in a town at the border of Hang Zhou, the capital city of Zhe Province. This building might be the tallest hotel building in the entire town.</p> <p>The hotel was decorated luxuriously. The few crystal chandeliers in the lobby were each worth tens of thousands of yuan, and the furniture pieces which had been scratched broken by zombies were all first-class goods originally.</p> <p>Soon, the group of people wiped out the zombies in the corridor and started looking for a place to settle down temporarily.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At the same time, Lin Qiao’s body was changing in a strange way. A stream of dark smoke came out of her head, looking like the black smoke produced by a burning object. It didn’t spread in the water, but went down through her head slowly.</p> <p>The dark green energy seemed to be afraid of the black smoke, because once it appeared, the dark green energy moved away. In the meantime, the vines which wrapped Lin Qiao’s body quickly drew away.</p> <p>Soon, the smoke which was released from the top of Lin Qiao’s head covered her entire head. It didn’t stop there, but kept flowing out of her head and slowly moving toward her neck, chest, arm, waist, and the rest of her body. Soon, it wrapped her up entirely.</p> <p>After the smoke covered Lin Qiao’s entire body, the vines unwrapped her and all drew back to the bottom of the lake.</p> <p>The black smoke didn’t linger on her skin for long, just less than three minutes. After that, it started going back to her head, exposing her body slowly, starting from her feet.</p> <p>Her exposed feet and lower legs weren’t the same as before.</p> <p>Both her original bluish pale skin and newly grown skin had turned glowing white, like a piece of white jade.</p> <p>Her skin tissue had become entirely different from before, but she hadn’t found out about that. The black smoke kept drawing back to her head, exposing her thighs and upper body.</p> <p>She still had a large wound in her stomach, which was now covered by a strange membrane. Except for that, her other body parts had all been restored, turned glowing white. Right now, she was looking like a giant piece of jade in the water, and her skin was covered in faint shadows of the rippling water.</p> <p>Sensing that the black smoke was fading, the vines which had drawn back to the bottom of the lake reached up and wrapped her body once again.</p> <p>Soon, the black smoke disappeared, exposing Lu Tianyu’s perfectly pretty face, which had been restored completely. All the scars on that face were gone.</p> <p>However, what had disappeared along with those scars were Lin Qiao’s hair. God knew how Lin Qiao would react when she woke up and touched her bald head.</p> <p>This time, the vines didn’t wrap her up entirely, but only coiled on her soft and slim waist, then poked her skin and happily slid over her hairless head.</p> <p>She didn’t wake up until the next day.</p> <p>When she opened her eyes again, her pupils had become glowing green. The black parts of her eyes only accentuated the greenness.</p> <p>However, the greenness in her eyes soon dimmed and faded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao blinked, then turned to look at her own body and found that it had already changed.</p> <p>She saw her white and perfectly undamaged skin. The membrane on her stomach was strange, but the rest of her body looked normal…</p> <p>…Not normal as a zombie, but as a true human being.</p> <p>A few vines had wrapped her waist to keep her from sinking down or floating up. She moved her hand and touched the membrane on her stomach with it. Her finger felt the membrane, but her stomach felt nothing.</p> <p>As she pressed, the membrane was hollowed.</p> <p><em>‘It seems that it’ll still take a long while for my stomach to be healed fully. I’ve suffered so much pain this time, but only a membrane grew out here. When can my internal organs regrow?’ </em>She wondered.</p> <p>She suddenly thought of her face. So, she hurriedly raised her hands to touch it. She felt a rough surface, as if the dead skin of the wounds was still on her face.</p> <p>She rubbed her face and found the edges of the dead skin as she had expected. After that, she immediately started to peel the dead skin off her face.</p> <p>The dead skin was surprisingly easy to peel. Once she tore it slightly, a large piece of it fell off. As she was enjoying the peeling, she suddenly found that there was no more dead skin on her face.</p> <p>She touched her face and felt that it was very smooth, without any dead skin. But while touching her face, she had a strong feeling.</p> <p>‘ <em>Eh </em>?’</p> <p>Suddenly, she moved her hand upward and sensed her smooth scalp, feeling stunned right away. She spent a while rubbing her head, wondering if her feeling was wrong.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Damn! My hair? Where… Where are my hair!’</em></p> <p>She didn’t mind having short hair like a man, but why the hell did she feel that her scalp was cold? Why on earth was she bald?</p> <p><em>‘How am I supposed to face anybody if I have no hair? Even though my face has been fixed, but my hair…’</em></p> <p>After complaining in her head and feeling her scalp with her hands a few times, she reluctantly accepted the fact that she was bald.</p> <p><em>‘Whatever… I can be bald! I look cool this way! Hah!’ </em>While sighing, she lowered her head to look at the vine wrapping around her waist.</p> <p><em>‘Tell me, where did my hair go?’</em></p> <p>The vine plant seemed to sense her thoughts, so it reached out a vine to rub her soft breasts.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Have my breasts grown out?’ </em>At that time, she finally noticed her full bosoms.</p> <p>Moreover, those breasts seemed to be rather large, albeit covered by a thick layer of dead skin. Seeing that dead skin, Lin Qiao immediately forgot about the vines and raised her hands to peel it.</p> <p>At that point, the vines had quietly unwrapped from around her waist and drawn away.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao thought of the vines, they were gone already. The water was still filled with a great amount of dark green energy, thicker than before by a few times.</p> <p>She looked around and touched her head again, then swam toward the water surface with complicated feelings.</p>",
  "Chapter 154: Big B*obs Are A Problem": "<p>Junjun carried Tongtong as she waited by the lakeside for quite a while. Finally, she saw the rippling lake surface calm down, and then saw a figure coming out of the water, swimming toward the lakeside.</p> <p><em>‘Eh… eh?’</em></p> <p>When she saw the bald head bob up, she doubted her own eyes. As Lin Qiao came closer and closer to the lakeside, Junjun finally confirmed that what she just saw was a head.</p> <p>The bald figure had a pretty face which was wearing a grumpy look. It slowly swam to the lakeside from the center of the lake.</p> <p>Junjun stared at Lin Qiao’s head while thinking, <em>‘She’s so bald!’ </em></p> <p>Seeing the unhappy look in the latter’s face, she couldn’t help but cover her mouth with her hand and laugh. Lin Qiao glanced at Junjun and found that Tongtong had fallen asleep in her arms. After that, she walked out of the water and showed her clean and smooth body.</p> <p>Then, she walked to the lakeside, picked up her clothes, and quickly put them on.</p> <p>Having laughed for a while, Junjun turned back to look at Lin Qiao. Her appearance had changed, but her vibe remained the same as before. Not exactly the same though, as it was now much stronger than before, giving Junjun a greater pressure.</p> <p>While looking at Lin Qiao carefully, Junjun found that her face was delicate and beautiful. However, her oval face and bald head made her look really like an egg.</p> <p>Looking at Lin Qiao, Junjun burst out into laughter again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rolled her a cold stare. <em>‘Can’t you tell that I’m quite unhappy right now? Yet you’re laughing!’</em></p> <p>Suddenly, Tongtong woke up, maybe because he had sensed Junjun’s emotion. He rubbed his eyes, then looked around confusedly.</p> <p>When he saw Lin Qiao’s bald head, he paused.  <em>‘Em… Who’s this person? Why doesn’t she have hair? Where’s her hair?’ </em>He stared at Lin Qiao, his face filled with confusion.</p> <p>After getting dressed, Lin Qiao touched her bald head, feeling a little strange. Then, she paused briefly and lowered her head to look at her chest.</p> <p>Before, when she didn’t have b*obs, she used to wear sleeveless shirts directly. Just now, she did the same habitually. However, her breasts had grown back out in a considerable size, and her new skins and nipples were rather sensitive.</p> <p>Once she put the sleeveless shirt on, the chest area became a little too snug, pressing against her skin. When she moved her body, she sensed a tingling and itchy feeling that made her extremely uncomfortable.</p> <p><em>‘Should I try finding a bra for myself right now?’</em></p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao stare at her own chest confusedly, Junjun, who stood beside her, immediately figured out her problem and felt like laughing again. <em>‘Can she still feel things?’ </em>Junjun wondered.</p> <p>She was right! Lin Qiao had gotten all her sensations back. Her eyes were still black, but the world in those eyes was no longer black and white. She was now able to see all the colors that healthy human beings could see.</p> <p>Her skin could feel things too. Otherwise, why would she feel so uncomfortable because of her sensitive nipples now?</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao hadn’t noticed that her sensations were restored yet. At the moment, the only thing she could think of was to look in Qiu Lili’s closet for a bra which fit her b*obs!</p> <p>However, thinking of Qiu Lili’s immature body, she felt a little hopeless.</p> <p>She also needed to find a hat!</p> <p>Once she thought of her own current appearance, she felt grim again.</p> <p><em>‘Will my hair grow back out? I think they will! I won’t stay this way, will I? Bald? No way!’ </em>Thinking of that possibility, she paused again.  <em>‘Damn! My face has been fixed, but why am I bald! Why do I feel that my destiny has been joking around with me? Does it want me to constantly suffer?’</em></p> <p>Feeling depressed for a little while, Lin Qiao soon adjusted her mindset and began angrily wondering if she had somehow offended a God or Goddess, which gave her all sorts of troubles. While thinking, she turned to walk toward Qiu Lili’s belongings.</p> <p>She glanced down and measured her b*obs with her eyes, then guessed that she had D-cup.</p> <p>She felt so strange having a pair of big b*obs out of nowhere!</p> <p>Junjun carried Tongtong and followed behind Lin Qiao. Tongtong’s eyes had been fixed on the back of Lin Qiao’s head.</p> <p>He wasn’t afraid of Lin Qiao anymore, and instead was very curious about Lin Qiao’s bald head, wanting rather badly to touch it…</p> <p>While walking, Lin Qiao suddenly turned back to glance at Junjun’s chest. After that, she expressionlessly turned her head around and walked to Qiu Lili’s large closet.</p> <p>She measured Junjun’s bra size with her eyes and found that it was no larger than B.</p> <p>Seeing this, Junjun felt a little speechless.</p> <p>As she had thought, Lin Qiao only found small sized bras from Qiu Lili’s closet, but none of her size.</p> <p>She glanced at Junjun again, whose bra wasn’t wearable to her either. So, she had no choice but to look outside. She just didn’t know if she could still find any bra out there.</p> <p>Big boobs were a problem, because she couldn’t find a suitable bra! However, she did find a suitable hat.</p> <p>She found a headband to wrap her head up, then put on the black baseball hat and her sunglasses.</p> <p>Now, she looked suspicious again.</p> <p>Enduring the strange feeling coming from her chest, Lin Qiao brought Junjun and Tongtong out of her space.</p> <p>Once they were out, Qiu Lili instantly sensed them. She had waited for the whole night. At last, she turned over the largest turtle back to sit on its back.</p> <p>But of course, she ordered her zombie servants to find a piece of cloth to put on the turtle shell before she sat on it.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao and the other two showed up, she immediately stood up from the turtle shell. However, she paused when she prepared to walk to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Next, she looked at Lin Qiao from head to toe with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had changed thoroughly. Her face was different, and her vibe was stronger than before.</p> <p>This time, Qiu Lili sensed Lin Qiao’s level, but still couldn’t sense her power.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Still level-four? Newly promoted level-four?’ </em>She felt strange.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had given her a much greater sense of danger, judging by which, she should be at the same level as her. Did Lin Qiao trigger her superpower just now? But, why had she been able to use her space this whole time?</p> <p>With her large red eyes, Qiu Lili stared at Lin Qiao’s head which was covered by the headband and the hat while slowly getting closer to her. After that, she made a few circles around the latter out of curiosity, then turned to Junjun confusedly.</p> <p><em>‘Why? What happened to her? Why did she become like this over a single night?’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 155: Speech And The Black Mist": "<p>Lin Qiao saw Qiu Lili’s eyes. Before, she was only able to see the red energy in her eyes, but now, she could see the color of her eyes as well. She found that the latter had beautiful eyes that were red in color, with black pupils.</p> <p>She raised her eyes to look around and saw the familiar green plants and brown earth. After that, she turned to the lake and found it to be very dark. The water in that lake was dark green.</p> <p>Then, she raised her head to look at the sky. The blueness of the sky was long-lost to her. In her eyes, the morning sunlight had colors too.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n<em>‘Did you trigger a superpower?’  </em>At that moment, Qiu Lili asked abruptly. Hearing that, Lin Qiao turned back to her. Junjun was looking at her curiously as well.</p> <p><em>‘Isn’t that space my superpower?’ </em>Lin Qiao thought. She opened her mouth as she wanted to give a roar to answer Qiu Lili’s question. However, once she did that, she got a strange feeling from her tongue and throat.</p> <p>She raised her hand to pinch her throat with confusion, then her eyes showed an uncertain look.</p> <p>Seeing her touch her throat suddenly, Qiu Lili and Junjun both felt a little strange about it. Then, they noticed her look, and were confused.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s throat squirmed slightly. After that, she opened her mouth and looked at Junjun and Qiu Lili while trying to say, “Ah… eh… I… I…”</p> <p>After saying ‘I’ twice, she paused, staring at Qiu Lili and Junjun with disbelief, her eyes popped open.</p> <p>At that moment, Qiu Lili and Junjun were staring back at her with shock, as if she were a ghost.</p> <p>They both doubted their ears…</p> <p>The disbelief on Lin Qiao’s face slowly turned into surprise. Next, she raised a hand and took off her sunglasses abruptly.</p> <p>With the hand which was holding the sunglasses, she pointed at Qiu Lili and said, “You…”</p> <p>Then, she turned toward Junjun and continued, “Her…”</p> <p>After that, she looked at Tongtong, who was eying her with curiosity, and said, “Tong… tong…</p> <p>Her voice was little dry and shrill, but undeniably, she had indeed said ‘you’, ‘I’, ‘her’, and ‘Tongtong’.</p> <p>Qiu Lili widened her eyes as well. She turned to look at Junjun in shock, and found that the latter was doing exactly the same. With the look in their eyes, they told each other that they weren’t in a dream.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was actually able to talk! Even though she had become very much like a human being, Junjun and Qiu Lili hadn’t forgotten about that fact that she was a zombie. But just now, this zombie had talked!</p> <p>“What… superpower?” At that moment, Lin Qiao asked slowly.</p> <p>Qiu Lili opened her mouth to try and move her throat and tongue. However, what she uttered was still a roar.<br/>\n‘Your zombie superpower…’ she said.</p> <p>After finding out that her own voice hadn’t changed at all, Qiu Lili immediately pulled a long face.</p> <p>Hearing Qiu Lili’s words, Lin Qiao thought that if she had triggered a superpower, she should have energy inside her body. Even though she didn’t know why Qiu Lili suddenly asked that question, she sensed something after hearing it.</p> <p>She closed her eyes to feel if she had energy inside her body. Before today, she was able to sense others’ energies, but had never sensed her own.</p> <p>Once she closed her eyes, she found that she could still see everything before her eyes, albeit in black and white. It was just like how she saw the outside world when closing her eyes in her space.</p> <p>The things she was seeing now were colorless. After her eyes were closed, she could only see the shapes of things, in the colors of black, grey, and white.</p> <p>But of course, she could see the colors of energies.</p> <p>Qiu Lili didn’t only have red eyes, but also had two energies inside her body, one red and one blue. She then turned to Junjun and found no energy inside her body, only the dark virus.</p> <p>Tongtong’s little body contained a faint glowing green energy. Lin Qiao knew that it was the energy of the lake water.</p> <p>At that point, a strange wave of energy from her brain caught her attention. She forced herself to block the things before her eyes, then sensed a warmth from her head.</p> <p>It made her feel warm and comfortable.</p> <p>She wanted to get close to that warmth and figure out what it was. Once she had this idea, that warmth entered her mind and slowly spread in her entire body, as if it had been waiting to be summoned.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao sank into her mind to feel that strange warm energy, her body began changing.</p> <p>Qiu Lili and Junjun, who were standing by her sides, both felt thumps of their hearts. The instinctive sense of danger possessed by zombies made them automatically draw back.</p> <p>As they moved meters away from Lin Qiao, a wave of black mist suddenly rose from her body. The black mist rolled across her body surface, but didn’t spread as Junjun and Qiu Lili had imagined.</p> <p>“Ah!” Qiu Lili suddenly roared at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Hearing her, Lin Qiao opened her eyes immediately. Though the black mist, Qiu Lili saw a pair of sparkling green eyes, which soon disappeared.</p> <p>In fact, those eyes didn’t disappear, but turned into a glowing pair of black eyes, blending into the black mist.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw the black mist before her eyes once she opened them. She raised her hands to wave in the mist. However, no matter how hard she waved her hands, she couldn’t dissipate it.</p> <p>“Roar! Ah!”<br/>\n‘Take your mist back now! It’s poisonous!’</p> <p>Qiu Lili uttered another roar. While doing that, she dragged Junjun and moved further away from Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Junjun was curiously looking at the strange black mist which came out of Lin Qiao’s body. Hearing Qiu Lili say that it was poisonous, she hurriedly carried Tongtong and took a few steps backward.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was trying to gather all the black mist on her palm when she heard Qiu Lili’s roar.</p> <p>“Poisonous?” She asked with her dry voice. She thought that she could maybe learn to control this black mist like how she learned to use her space. So, she looked at the mist and said ‘in’ in her head.</p> <p>Then, she raised her hands, picturing the black mist gathering into her palms.</p> <p>As she had expected, she saw the rolling black mist gather toward her palms, soon drilling in and disappearing.</p> <p>Then, she looked at Qiu Lili and Junjun, finding that the two were keeping vigilance against her.<br/>\n“Are you… afraid?” She asked.</p> <p><em>‘You’re both zombies, but are you still afraid of the poisonous mist?’ </em>She didn’t understand. Junjun remained silent and just nodded, then looked at Tongtong who was in her arms.</p> <p>Lin Qiao figured out her meaning on seeing Tongtong. Junjun was afraid that the poisonous mist might hurt him.</p> <p>Only after Lin Qiao made the black mist disappear did Qiu Lili slowly come closer.</p> <p>“Roar! Ahhh!”<br/>\n<em>‘Your mist made me feel danger,’ </em>she said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with surprise. Qiu Lili was a zombie queen, so why would she be afraid of the poisonous mist?</p>",
  "Chapter 156: The Space Has Become Larger than Before": "<p><em>‘Poisonous mist? So it has poison in it, right?’ </em>Lin Qiao thought for a moment. After that, in order to test her newly developed mist, she quickly ran to the other side. She reached out her hands, with her palms down toward a bush of grass.</p> <p><em>‘Come out of my hands! Come out of my hands!’ </em>She murmured in her head. Next, she sensed a warmth emerging from her brain and moving to her stomach, then to her shoulders, and soon reaching her arms.</p> <p>Afterward, she saw a wisp of black mist come out of her palms.</p> <p>The black mist flowed out of her palms, then slowly touched the grass down on the ground.</p> <p>What happened next made everyone’s heart sink.</p> <p>The black mist didn’t poison the grass, but made them disappear. Soon, the mist ‘bit off’ the grass like the mouth of a herbivore. Looking at the small piece of the grass which was ‘eaten’ by the black mist, Lin Qiao was stunned.</p> <p>She didn’t think that the mist could actually devour things.</p> <p>She took the black mist back, then squatted to look at the grass. The bush of grass now had a gap in it, as if a cow had taken a bite here.</p> <p>The grasses didn’t stop disappearing after Lin Qiao took the black mist back. Instead, the grasses which were touched by the mist kept disappearing, and the grass blades surrounding them turned black, then rotted and disappeared as well.</p> <p>The rotten circle had been expanding across this bush of grass. The further it went, the slower it spread. Lin Qiao guessed that the grasses would stop rotting when the rotten circle had reached a certain size.</p> <p>The black mist had only touched the grasses within one-meter squared, but by now, the rotten circle had spread quite farther than that.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was still squatting there. The poisonous mist didn’t seem to be able to harm her, but as for her shoes…</p> <p>As she received a strange feeling from the bottom of her feet, she hurriedly stood up and drew back.</p> <p>She was surprised to find out that her real superpower was the black mist. So, what level was she at? Wasn’t the space her real superpower? Or, did she have two kinds of superpowers?</p> <p>She had heard that level-five zombies were able to control ordinary zombies. She didn’t have that capability before, so she wondered if she could do it now.</p> <p>She raised her head to look at the sky, then found that it was morning already. But, was it the second day after she entered her space, or the third day?</p> <p>She abruptly turned to ask Qiu Lili, “How long have I… em!”</p> <p>While speaking, she felt that her throat was itchy. So, she cleared her throat and continued asking, “How many days have I spent in there?”</p> <p>“Ah-ya!”<br/>\n<em>‘A night.’</em></p> <p>Qiu Lili blinked her eyes and responded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned her head to look at the few large turtles which had stopped moving. She couldn’t tell if they were all thrown into unconsciousness by Qiu Lili or were too scared to reach out their heads.</p> <p>She suddenly remembered that she still had one turtle in her space. She wondered if it had managed to turn itself over.</p> <p>Thinking of the turtle, she flashed into her space.</p> <p>Once in, she felt something strange.</p> <p><em>‘Why is it so large!’</em></p> <p>The space was over three times larger than before. The grassland remained the same as before, and so did her strawberry plants and vegetables, Qiu Lili’s belongings, and the pile of furniture pieces.</p> <p>Earlier on when she came out of the lake, she was focusing on her bald head and b*obs, so she didn’t notice the change of the space. But now, she discovered the woods behind the grassland!</p> <p>Then, she found that the small space had moved backward!</p> <p><em>‘Why did it move backward! Where did these trees come from?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to look at the lake, then grabbed a cup to drink from it. After saying a few words, her throat itched quite badly.</p> <p>The cold water flushed through her throat along with the familiar energy, instantly easing that dry and itchy feeling.</p> <p>She drank three cups of water in a row, then put the cup on the table. After that, she turned and walked toward where she had left that turtle.</p> <p>She couldn’t tell if it were that kernel of the vine plant from the outside which made the space expand. If it were, the vine plant in the lake in her space should be like the soul or heart of her space.</p> <p>She walked over and saw that the turtle was still there, lying on the ground with its head and limbs hiding in its shell.</p> <p>It seemed that this turtle wasn’t able to turn itself back straight.</p> <p>As the turtle didn’t run about in her space, Lin Qiao stopped worrying. Sensing its scent, she felt starving again.</p> <p>Had she consumed too much energy last night when her body was healed? She ate a turtle yesterday, but she was hungry already.</p> <p>However, she didn’t plan to eat the turtle right now.</p> <p>She looked at the turtle by her feet, then thought for a moment and exited her space. She came out to send the turtles outside into her space one after another, then entered the space herself to turn the turtles over and put them together.</p> <p>After that, she changed her shoes and went out again.</p> <p>“Let’s… go… find… them,” she said to Qiu Lili and Junjun. Even though she was able to talk now, she could only talk slowly, word by word, because her throat hadn’t gotten used to talking. She tried talking faster, but as a result, she wasn’t able to utter any sound.</p> <p>Talking slowly was great enough for her though, as she didn’t need to roar or write anymore. For the time being, she just needed to shorten her sentences as much as possible.</p> <p>Qiu Lili was standing beside the devoured grasses and curiously looking at them. Hearing Lin Qiao’s voice, she immediately turned back.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put on the sunglasses, then sniffed at where she came from. After confirming the location of Lin Feng and his people, she slowly led Junjun out of the woods. Qiu Lili flashed across the air and directly hopped on top of a tree. Then, she leaped out and disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked on the path which she came through, then raised her claw and swung across the air.</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p> <p>All the branches and vines were cut off immediately, exposing the path. With her claws, she would never need a machete.</p> <p>Soon, Lin Qiao and Junjun walked out of the park. Qiu Lili had already been waiting for them on top of a tree. Seeing them, she instantly leaped off the tree and came over.</p> <p>As the scars on her face were gone, Lin Qiao now looked exactly like a normal human being with her glasses on. Unlike her, Qiu Lili and Junjun still had features of zombies.</p> <p>There was no one in the town though. Except for Lin Feng and his people, the escaped Yang Jianhua was the only one who might be in this place.</p> <p>Lin Qiao estimated that she was now able to pick up a fight against a level-six superpowered human being.</p>",
  "Chapter 157: Without Qiao": "<p>On their way to the hotel, Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili paused suddenly. With the two of them stopping like that, Junjun looked at them confusedly.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao took off her sunglasses, her eyes shone brightly. She reached out a hand to drag Qiu Lili, who was prepared to rush out, and pushed her to Junjun.</p> <p>“I…go, you…with her!” She said a few words.</p> <p>Qiu Lili understood that Lin Qiao intended to deal with the suddenly appeared high-level zombie by herself and wanted her to stay behind to protect Junjun and Tongtong.</p> <p>Lin Qiao asked Qiu Lili to stay with Junjun, but in fact, the one who truly needed protection was Tongtong.</p> <p>Both Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili stopped moving because they suddenly sensed a level-five zombie moving toward Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>Qiu Lili wanted to go because she had an interest in playing with that zombie. Moreover, it would be nice for her to kill it and dig out its nucleus.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao dragged her and made her stop. She was a little unhappy to be told to stay by Lin Qiao, but as she asked her to protect Junjun and Tongtong, she had no choice but to agree.</p> <p>Even though Qiu Lili was powerful, she was rather obedient to Lin Qiao. It seemed that she would do whatever Lin Qiao told her to do. Besides, she wasn’t really interested in the zombie nucleus of level four or five zombies.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t let them stay there, but pointed at the hotel and said, “You… go…there!” After that, she flashed across the air and became invisible.</p> <p>On the other side, the group of people had spent a night in the hotel, but didn’t see Lin Qiao and the other zombie return.</p> <p>When they arrived, they cleaned a few adjoining rooms, then wiped out all the zombies on that floor. After that, they put Yuan Tianxing on a bed which was covered with dust.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and the other few female members were staying in a room, while Lin Hao and Du Yuanxing led the others to search through all sorts of storages of the hotel.</p> <p>Lin Feng had been resting in a room as well. At the moment, he was standing by a window, looking outside.</p> <p>“I wonder if Li Zheng and his people have safely arrived at the Sea City Base or not. They were all great fighters with superpowers, but the journey would have been long and full of dangers. If they bumped into level-five zombies, they might be in some troubles,” Mrs. Lin said while picking up a piece of cloth from the ground. She shook it and found that it was a towel.</p> <p>“They should be alright, as they are good at avoiding dangers. Even if they fell into dangerous situations, they wouldn’t all fall. Some people would have certainly arrived at the Sea City Base safely. What I’m worried about is the attitude of Sea City Base people. Qiao had made promises to them before, but she’s no longer with us. So, I can’t tell for sure if they’ll still help us or not.” Lin Feng said expressionlessly.</p> <p>By now, they were no longer with a level-seven powerful being, neither could them afford to pay the Sea City Base with what Lin Qiao had promised before. They could join the Sea City Base, but the Sea City Base people might not be willing to help them build a new base, or head to the Hades Base to help them save the other Hades Base people who were now under the Earth Dragon Base’s control.</p> <p>The Hades Base was far away from the Sea City Base. Sending a large number of superpowered ones to the Hades Base would largely weaken the Sea City Base. More importantly, the Sea City Base wouldn’t get anything in return by doing that.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin sighed and said, “Without Qiao, it’ll be too difficult for us to build a new base even if we want to. And, even if we manage to build that base, it’ll be even harder for us to guard it.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded in agreement. Among them, the strongest one was Yuan Tianxing, who was at the peak of level-six. Lin Feng had just stepped into level-six, and was still a lot weaker than Yuan Tianxing. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be injured so badly by Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua was at the peak of level-six as well, preparing to enter level-seven. If Long Yubai helped him, he would be able to break into level-seven in the near future.</p> <p>By then, Lin Feng and his people would be no match for him.</p> <p>So, for the time being, Lin Feng needed to try figuring out a way to save himself and his family. As for the other Hades Base people, they had to wait.</p> <p>The Hades Base had surely suffered a heavy casualty when Long Yubai and his people attacked. The enemy wasn’t in great numbers, but all of them were strong superpowered beings. Therefore, it was reasonable for the Hades Base to be broken.</p> <p>The Hades Base was only a little stronger than the Earth Dragon Base, because it had more level-five superpowered members than the latter.</p> <p>Both Hades Base and Earth Dragon Base had one level-seven leader and two level-six deputy leaders. As the leader of the Hades Base, Netherworld Fire failed to figure the true strength of her enemies because of Yang Jianhua’s fake information and what he did. Once the war began, the Hades Base had lost two level-six powerful beings very soon, so it was broken by Earth Dragon people effortlessly.</p> <p>The leader of the Hades Base was forced onto a cliff and blew herself up, while more than half of the level four and five superpowered members of the Hades Base were dead or injured. The rest were either caught or ran away, and the ordinary members were all brought under control.</p> <p>If some of them wanted to surrender, the Earth Dragon people would accept it, as long as they found a way to prove that they were no longer loyal to Netherworld Fire, or agreed to help in dealing with her subordinates who were on the run.</p> <p>The supplies owned by the Hades Base had undoubtedly fallen into Long Yubai’s hands. Even though Yang Jianhua had claimed that he would take over the Hades Base, he might not be able to become its new owner.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin’s words darkened the faces of everyone in the room.</p> <p>“If only Qiao were still alive…” Lin Feng said gloomily. They were shorthanded at the moment, so without a question, they weren’t able to build a new base. The Sea City Base had no reason to send people to help them either. As for joining the Sea City Base, they didn’t want that.</p> <p>The Sea City Base was a large base, its population multiple times greater than that of the Hades Base. Besides, the Sea City Base wasn’t run by one leader, but three. Plus, they had seven deputy leaders and numberless superpowered people at level four or five under their command.</p> <p>If they joined the Sea City Base, Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing as level-six superpowered men might earn them a certain standing. But after all, the Sea City Base wasn’t their home.</p> <p>Not long ago, Lin Feng was just a level-five. He unexpectedly broke into level-six during a fight, which allowed him to bring his family and soldiers all the way to Zhe Province.</p> <p>If he hadn’t upgraded, he would have been killed or caught by Yang Jianhua long ago.</p> <p>As everyone in the room was feeling depressed, a soldier abruptly ran upstairs. In fact, the squad of soldiers among them had all served their time in special forces. They were all great fighters; otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to follow Lin Feng to this place.</p> <p>This young soldier named Xing Le knocked the door before pushing it open and walking into the room. Filled with delight, he reported to Lin Feng, “Great Captain, we found solar power storage equipment in this hotel!”</p>",
  "Chapter 158: Found Frozen Meat": "<p>Solar power storage equipment was important in the post-apocalyptic era. After the apocalypse, lots of places didn’t have electricity or running water. However, solar power generation equipment allowed people to use all kinds of electrical appliances. Therefore, solar power equipment had been especially precious in all bases.</p> <p>If any zombie-hunting squad brought a set of solar power equipment back and gave it to their base, they would be treated well.</p> <p>Of course, they were allowed to keep the equipment for themselves.</p> <p>Hearing Xing Le say that they had found solar power equipment, the people in the room had their eyes glowing.</p> <p>“Can it work?” Lin Feng immediately stood up from the chair and asked in surprise.</p> <p>“The others are working on it,” said Xing Le.</p> <p>“Did you find any freezer or cold storage?” Lin Feng asked.</p> <p>“Not yet…” Xing Le shook his head and responded. Hearing that, the others were a little disappointed.</p> <p>They were running short of food. They still had some food stored in Lin Wenwen’s space, but they wouldn’t be able to last half a month with that food. During the past month, while heading to the Sea City Base and avoiding Yang Jianhua, they had consumed a large part of the food they had in reserve.</p> <p>So at the moment, they needed to arrive at the Sea City Base as quickly as possible, and also find some food.</p> <p>They didn’t dare to eat any plants as ninety percent of them had been infected by the virus. Therefore, they were mainly looking for cured, dried, and frozen food which were left from the old world.</p> <p>“Tell Lin Hao and Du Yuanxing to look carefully. This is a large hotel. It even has solar power equipment, so there’s no reason for it not to have any freezer.” Lin Feng said.</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” Xing Le responded hurriedly.</p> <p>“Go!” Lin Feng said, some slight hope filling his heart. Hearing that, Xing Le closed the door and left the room.</p> <p>It took quite a while for Lin Hao to finally find the cold storage of this hotel which was used for keeping cured food, dried food, and frozen food. But, the problem was that he and his people weren’t able to open it.</p> <p>That was because the electrical equipment in the cold storage was still running.</p> <p>The manager of this hotel powered the cold storage with the solar energy equipment to prevent a sudden power outage. In addition, they had also installed electrical storage devices, so extra electricity could be stored for the cold storage to keep running during the rainy days.</p> <p>However, as the cold storage was still energized, it was protected by an encryption lock. No one among the group had the skills to unlock it, so they were now waiting by the door of the cold storage anxiously.</p> <p>At last, Du Yuanxing suddenly thought of Long Qingying. She had metal power, and the door of the cold storage was made from metal. She must know how to open it.</p> <p>As he had expected, Long Qingying directly cut off the five-centimeters-thick alloy door by simply putting her hands on it.</p> <p>Seeing her open the door so easily, the group of men fell in silence.</p> <p>Once the door was opened, a freezing stream of air came out along with white mist, making the people outside shiver.</p> <p>They walked in and found that the cold storage was large, at least a hundred meters squared. Several freezers were placed in it in a straight line, next to piles of ice blocks.</p> <p>The group of people burst into laughter when they saw the pile of boxes full of iced fishes and the pork hanging next to them.</p> <p>Clearly, no one had entered this cold storage in a long time. Many stored foods in there seemed to be untouched. They hadn’t opened the freezers to check the food in them, but they found two horizontal steel tubes in the innermost area of the cold storage, and hanging on the steel tubes were fourteen or fifteen half pigs. It meant that they had found seven, maybe eight, butchered pigs in this place, which were all still frozen!</p> <p>In the middle of the cold storage were a series of boxes containing fishes, separated by layers of ice blocks.</p> <p>A dozen boxes of frozen fishes of different kinds were found.</p> <p>Back in the old world, many restaurants had live fishes in water tanks for the guests to choose from, but they might not serve the exact same fish that they got out of the water in front of the customer.</p> <p>The people opened the freezers and found some chicken, duck, and beef.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing couldn’t help but widely open his mouth and stare at all the frozen food with shining eyes. “These will last us a long time.”</p> <p>Long Qingying blandly glanced around, then turned back and asked, “Have you found rice or flour?”</p> <p>“Yes!” Lin Hao responded, “Down there in the storage. The rice in this hotel is well-packed, all good and edible.”</p> <p>The group of people was surprised to find so much food from this hotel building. Even better, the solar power equipment allowed them to cook directly in the kitchen.</p> <p>Even though there was no running water, they could melt some ice from this cold storage.</p> <p>“Should we thank that zombie who told us to come here? If it weren’t for him, we’d have gone somewhere else.”</p> <p>“Yeah, yeah!”</p> <p>“Is this place out of the way? Haven’t Sea City Base people searched this area?”</p> <p>“It might be. But, I didn’t think that this small town would actually have such a fancy hotel. Aren’t we lucky?”</p> <p>“Definitely! The meat in this cold storage is all good, and so is the rice!”</p> <p>They made themselves a dinner in the kitchen of the hotel, still waiting for the two zombies after that.</p> <p>The next morning, Lin Qiao came out of her space.</p> <p>However, before she could go to the hotel to check on Lin Feng and his people, she found something approaching. That zombie was still at a distance, yet she didn’t plan to let it get near to the hotel.</p> <p>She made herself invisible and moved in that direction for about a mile, then saw a swift figure leaping over the roofs of a series of small buildings.</p> <p>Every high-level zombie had their territory. Lin Feng and his people weren’t in this zombie’s territory, but as the zombie was pretty close to them, it had faintly sensed their scents.</p> <p>So, in the morning, it charged straight at the hotel. But to its surprise, it was forced to stop just as it was getting closer and closer to its prey.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was guarding on the zombie’s path after measuring its speed and route. This zombie used to be a young man at his twenties, but by now, it had become a ferocious zombie leader. Yet, Lin Qiao didn’t sense any pressure from it.</p> <p>She found two adjoining buildings, one tall and one small. The zombie was going to leap onto the roof of the small building from the tall one, so Lin Qiao squatted on the small building’s roof, waiting for it to come.</p> <p>As the zombie leader leaped down from above her head, Lin Qiao suddenly came out of her space and sprung up, then raised her claws high and swung toward the zombie which was still in mid-air.</p>",
  "Chapter 159: Stop It with A Surprise Attack": "<p>The level-five zombie wasn’t prepared for that sudden attack, so it failed to react timely. However, it still sharply sensed the incoming danger.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao suddenly appeared and sprung up, it sensed her immediately. However, the swift Lin Qiao leaped to its side within a blink and swung her claws at it.</p> <p>At that moment, the zombie leader tried its best to turn its body in the air and dodge her attack, but it was a little too late. The wind blades she created by shining her claws could now reach much further than meters away.</p> <p>After all, her appearance wasn’t the only thing that had changed.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>“Roar!” The level-five zombie burst in roars and fell onto the roof of the building nearby. It bent its legs to squat, hands on the ground and teeth bared; its dark eyes were popped to stare at Lin Qiao fiercely, seeming ready to pounce and bite her.</p> <p>It wondered where Lin Qiao was from, and why it didn’t know that another zombie at its level was nearby.</p> <p>The level-five zombies stared at Lin Qiao alertly while trying to figure out something about her. However, it wasn’t smart enough to find out why Lin Qiao would suddenly show up in this place. It had observed this area before, and no high-level zombie was found.</p> <p>It fixed its eyes on Lin Qiao, not even noticing that her claws had left a few wounds on its thighs. It couldn’t feel pain anyway.</p> <p>Lin Qiao landed on the roof and looked at this zombie from seven or eight meters away. She had put her sunglasses back into her space just now, so at the moment, she was quietly staring at the level-five zombie with her pair of black eyes from under the brim of her hat.</p> <p>She was surprised to realize that she didn’t need to be afraid of level-five zombies anymore. Half a month ago when the ice-powered zombie leader was chasing her, she didn’t even dare to get out of her space.</p> <p>However, things had changed dramatically in just half a month.</p> <p>She didn’t know what power this level-five zombie had, but judging by its reaction speed, it was rather weak. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be wounded by her claws so easily.</p> <p>The zombie leader didn’t attack Lin Qiao immediately because it was quite confused. Just now, it felt that the suddenly appeared Lin Qiao was at the same level as itself. But now, it had sensed that she was actually a level lower, just an ordinary level-four superpowered zombie.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao’s vibe made it feel endangered. It couldn’t understand why that was the case, as Lin Qiao was apparently at a lower level. It stared at her while thinking, its expression turning less ferocious and more confused.</p> <p>Nevertheless, its confused expression wouldn’t make Lin Qiao show any mercy. This zombie had a very strong hostility, and its entire body was radiating a thick scent of blood.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could smell the blood of lower level zombies and human beings from it, which meant that this zombie often ate human beings! Besides, judging by the strong scent of blood from it, it had eaten human flesh not long ago.</p> <p>The zombie thought for a while but failed to figure out a thing. After that, its expression changed, and it gave Lin Qiao a fierce roar.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>It warned her strongly by roaring, trying to scare her away.</p> <p><em>‘It actually tried to warn me and drive me away,’ </em>Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>She looked at the zombie, feeling like laughing. The zombie was so simple-minded that it actually believed Lin Qiao would leave after hearing its warning roar.</p> <p>In the next second, she disappeared from where she was. She didn’t know what power the zombie had, so she decided to try attacking it to see how powerful it was, then kill it carefully.</p> <p>The invisible Lin Qiao quietly came up behind the zombie.</p> <p>When she disappeared before its eyes, the zombie leader was stunned again.</p> <p>“Roar?” It popped its black eyes to look around, but didn’t see a trace of her. It had no idea that she was about to launch a lethal attack from behind it.</p> <p>A swift invisible figure flashed across the air behind it, then a pair of claws were swung at the back of its head, stirring up a gust of wind.</p> <p>The zombie leader instinctively sensed the attack and gave a start. It was already too late for it to dodge, so it had no other choice but to defend itself with its superpower.</p> <p>Clang!</p> <p>A rasping sound was heard.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw that the zombie’s head, neck, and back were all suddenly added with a metallic luster. Her attack didn’t cause any serious harm to it, only leaving a few white traces on its metallic skin.</p> <p>As her attack didn’t work, she hurriedly leaped backward. She wasn’t disappointed, but stared at the zombie knowingly.</p> <p>It turned out that the zombie had meter power, just like Long Qingying.</p> <p>The zombie leader quickly turned around and hunched its back as it stared at Lin Qiao and uttered a growl, its eyes filled with a murderous intention.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Before it roared out, Lin Qiao had already sensed its anger.</p> <p>It was mad…</p> <p>The zombie leader was really mad. After roaring at Lin Qiao, it swiftly and impatiently sprung up to pounce on her.</p> <p>When the zombie charged, Lin Qiao didn’t flash into her space. Instead, she quickly raised a claw to swing at the zombie from up to down. After that, she stepped back and turned around.</p> <p>By turning around, she nimbly dodged the zombie leader’s metal claws.</p> <p>The zombie leader’s claws had already become much longer than before. Those twenty-centimeters-long claws were perfectly straight, like five sharp steel blades.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>As Lin Qiao moved away, the zombie leader directly fell to the ground, its claws cutting deep into the ground. Judging by the noises it made, its claws had cut the ground as easily as cutting tofu.</p> <p>Those claws were incredibly sharp!</p> <p>It missed its target, but immediately after that, it turned back to slash its long claws at Lin Qiao while baring its teeth to roar deeply at her.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her eyebrows, sensing that the zombie’s voice was filled with anger and discontentment due to her sneak attack. It seemed that the zombie wanted to fight face to face against her.</p> <p>It had actually challenged her!</p> <p>She reached out her hands and moved her fingers. <em> ‘Fight face to face? Alright, I’ll fulfill your wish before you die!’ </em>Lin Qiao gave the zombie leader a cold smile.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie leader roared again at her as it understood her meaning. It hunched its back deeper, eyes fixed straight on her. He seemed ready to dart at her and cut off her head at any time.</p> <p>As same as the zombie leader, Lin Qiao moved her right foot backward for about a meter and then raised her claws, preparing to attack.</p>",
  "Chapter 160: Being Chased": "<p>Seeing that Lin Qiao was preparing to attack, the zombie leader thrust its legs against the ground, charging at her like a bolt of lightning.</p> <p>Cling! Crack!</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched the zombie rush toward her. When it attacked with its claws, she suddenly bent her knees and raised her claws, accurately and swiftly catching the pair of steel claws which were slashing toward her head.</p> <p>Her claws weren’t made of steel, yet were stronger than the zombie’s steel claws.</p> <p>After jamming the zombie’s claws, Lin Qiao pushed her feet against the ground and twisted her waist. Meanwhile, she pulled her arms sideward and dragged the zombie to the side.</p> <p>When the zombie leader was thrown to the ground, Lin Qiao raised a foot and kicked it on the stomach.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>The zombie thudded against the building nearby and then fell to the ground.</p> <p>After giving a kick, Lin Qiao sprung up and swiftly chased after it. Before the zombie realized what was happening, Lin Qiao had already rushed up and swung her claws at it.</p> <p>This time, her claws landed right on its body.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>The zombie didn’t have enough time to cover its body with metal before suffering a series of wind blades created by Lin Qiao’s claws. By the time it managed to react, a few deep wounds were already left on its body.</p> <p>The wind blades cut the zombie like sharp swords, creating straight wounds.</p> <p>The zombie fell to the ground as a few smooth slashing wounds were added to its body. Thick and black blood gushed out of those wounds along with the one on its thigh, which was caused by Lin Qiao’s first attack.</p> <p>“Roar… roar!” It struggled back up from the ground while making noises with its throat. It looked at its wounds, which were soon covered by a layer of metal, and the bleeding was stopped.</p> <p>Apparently, Lin Qiao’s attack had worked on it.</p> <p>It was slower than her, which was why the latter managed to harm it quite easily.</p> <p>The zombie alertly got up on all fours and raised its head to look at Lin Qiao, who was descending from the roof.</p> <p>At the moment, this zombie leader with a relatively lower IQ was a little confused again. Lin Qiao was at a lower level, but why was she so strong? Its attacks had been completely ineffective on her; on the contrary, she managed to hurt it a few times in a row, and it wasn’t able to doge at all.</p> <p>The zombie leader was agitated after suffering Lin Qiao’s attacks for a few times in a row, uttering a series of fierce roars.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly looked at it, but suddenly turned her head to stare at another direction, the look on her face changed. With some uncertainty, she tried to sense something from that direction.</p> <p>As she was distracted, the zombie leader immediately charged at her.</p> <p>Once it moved, Lin Qiao turned back and swiftly took a step backward. When the zombie was about a meter away from her, she abruptly turned her body and made a spin kick. Her foot neatly hit its side waist and sent it flying out.</p> <p>Miles away in an industrial district where Lin Qiao had stared at earlier, a few figures were moving on the roof of a factory. One of them was running at the front while three were following behind it. Judging by their movements, they all had superpowers.</p> <p>Down on the ground, two vehicles were driving on the road behind them. In the first car, a few people looked at the ones on the roof while chatting. “How can the boy be so nimble?”</p> <p>“Who knows? He’s injured so badly, yet he’s still full of vigor. Look, he can still leap across roofs…Amazing!”</p> <p>“Em, so what? I don’t think he can hang on for long.”</p> <p>“True! Boss and the others are really slow! Is this fun?”</p> <p>“Haha… Don’t you know Boss well enough? He’s just bored in the journey!”</p> <p>“They’re bored indeed. How can three level-five superpowered men spend such a long while chasing after a level-four? They’ve been running for such a long time. I think it’s time for them to do something serious!”</p> <p>“You should give them a shout and tell them to finish that boy as soon as possible. We’re arriving at the center of the town. I heard that there’s a zombie leader here. Tell them to save some strength for it.”</p> <p>“Alright…Oi, Boss! Stop playing! Finish the boy off now! We’re arriving at our destination!” A man in the first car stuck his head out of the car window and yelled at the ones on the roof.</p> <p>“Okay!” Soon, a man on the roof responded.</p> <p>The man who was on the run had an angular face, seeming to be in his twenties. His clothes were ragged, stained by dark-red blood. He looked messy and not so agile, but still, he was trying his best to run forward.</p> <p><em>‘Almost there! Almost there!’ </em>Xie Dong kept telling himself that while leaping forward without pausing.</p> <p>“Stop running! You’re not gonna get away!” A man among the three behind him yelled. While speaking, he suddenly sped up and turned into a shred of shadow to leap over Xie Dong’s head. He flipped in the air and landed before the latter.</p> <p>The road was blocked, but Xie Dong didn’t stop right away. Instead, he rushed straight at the man.</p> <p>As he swung his hands, flame quickly rose from his palms. The flame was thrown at that man before Xie Dong could touch him.</p> <p>The man stood there and calmly raised a hand to bring up a tornado, which instantly blew Xie Dong’s flame away.</p> <p>“How dare you try attacking me with your tiny little fire!” The man sneered scornfully. At the moment, Xie Dong was three meters away from the man. Before he made another step forward, the man waved his hand away and sent him backward with a strong gust of wind.</p> <p>On the other side, while fighting the zombie leader, Lin Qiao had been turning to where Xie Dong was from time to time. Among the few vibes she had sensed, one was particularly familiar. ‘Am I wrong, or did he really come here?’ She wondered.</p> <p>The vibes of the few superpowered people were strong and strange to Lin Qiao, while the one familiar to her was weak and unstable.</p> <p><em>‘What’s going on?’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 161: Bite Hard": "<p>Lin Qiao, who was attracted by what was happening on the factory roof, had already lost her interest in the level-five zombie in front of her.</p> <p>“Roar!” It might be Lin Qiao’s careless attitude that made the zombie leader feel underestimated. Once again, it gave a roar with discontentment. Lin Qiao turned back to look at the zombie leader which was staring at her with cold eyes, then sneered in her heart.</p> <p><em>‘Since you want to die sooner, I’ll let you!’ </em>With that thought, she bared her teeth and uttered a roar as well. After that, she charged at the zombie immediately.</p> <p>Sensing the scornful meaning in Lin Qiao’s roar, the zombie was infuriated again. As she rushed at it, it pounced on her as well without thinking.<br/>\nWhen Lin Qiao darted up to it and raised her claw to start an intense fight against it, she suddenly made a deceptive movement and turned her body.</p> <p>The zombie leader thought that Lin Qiao was going to launch an attack directly, but to its surprise, she suddenly moved to the side. Its claws failed to touch her, and the inertia brought its body forward, right before her.</p> <p>At that point, the zombie leader instinctively sensed a life-threatening danger. However, it was already too late for it to draw back. Lin Qiao grasped the opportunity and swung her claws at the zombie.</p> <p>The zombie leader figured it wouldn’t be a big deal as it had taken Lin Qiao’s claw attack for a few times. However, it didn’t understand why it had a fear of danger in its heart.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao swung her claws, a thick dark mist was released, being brought to the zombie leader by the sharp wind caused by her claws. The zombie leader immediately moved backward as the black mist touched it.</p> <p>It stared at Lin Qiao and bared its eyes. A strange noise could be heard from its throat, sounding like the breathing of an angry cat.</p> <p>But, the zombie leader soon sensed something wrong. It hurriedly lowered its head and found that a part of its waist was gone.</p> <p>Indeed, a part of its body was gone. Before it realized what was happening, it heard a crack, and then its left arm fell on the ground.</p> <p>Right at that moment, it heard a slight swishing sound from behind its head.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>Then, it felt something slide across its neck. After that, it couldn’t sense its body anymore.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood behind the zombie leader and chopped its neck, cutting open its head before it fell.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>She quickly split its head and dug out the yellow nucleus, then immediately turned back to leap toward where Xie Dong was.</p> <p>At that moment, Xie Dong had suffered a kick and thudded against the wall next to him. He slid off the wall, his blood leaving some large dark-red marks on the wall.</p> <p>“I’ve been meaning to ask you why your blood is dark-red. It’s not like healthy blood.” The three men came up to him. One of them stepped on his body and asked with his arms crossed.</p> <p>“Cut the crap! This guy is mute, don’t you know that? Have you heard any sound he made?” Another man said. “You, give us the zombie nucleus! Do you want to have the level-four zombie nucleus for yourself? In your dream!” He frowned and yelled at Xie Dong.</p> <p>Xie Dong raised a hand and gripped the foot on his chest. Meanwhile, he fiercely glared at the three men in the eyes and bared his teeth which were covered in blood, smiling silently.</p> <p>Even though he was trampled under someone’s foot, he wouldn’t make himself look weak in front of his enemies. Moreover, someone was almost here! He just needed to hang on for a little longer!</p> <p>The three men didn’t know that an enemy was charging at them.</p> <p>They saw Xie Dong smile fearlessly and wondered why he could still smile under such a situation.</p> <p>“How can you still smile? I guess you want to die sooner. I’ll help you then!” said the man who had stepped on Xie Dong’s chest. While talking, he tried to take back his foot which was clenched in the latter’s hand.</p> <p>However, before that, Xie Dong abruptly raised his head and dragged up the man’s foot, then widely opened his mouth to bite on his ankle.</p> <p>“Ah! Damn you! Let go of me! Ah!” The man burst in screams. He didn’t expect Xie Dong to bite him, immediately suffering a great pain. The other two were stunned on watching Xie Dong holding the man’s ankle tightly in his mouth with a twisted grin.</p> <p>“Damn! Is he a dog!” The two of them a step backward, then one of them raised a foot to kick Xie Dong’s head.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>This heavy kick tilted Xie Dong’s head, even making him feel dizzy. However, he didn’t loosen his teeth at all.</p> <p>“Ah! It hurts! Damn! Make this b*stard open his mouth!” As Xie Dong’s head was tilted, his teeth sank deeper into that man’s ankle. More blood was squeezed out of the man’s wounds, even soaking a part of his trousers’ leg.</p> <p>“Don’t you have wind power? Can’t you cut off his jaw with your wind blade?” The man who had made an unhelpful kick couldn’t help but yell at the man whose ankle was still in Xie Dong’s mouth.</p> <p>Reminded by the other man, the man who was bitten by Xie Dong suddenly remembered his wind power. He was capable of shredding Xie Dong with his power directly, but he forgot about that before as his foot hurt so much.</p> <p>He immediately raised a hand to prepare to activate his power. But all of a sudden, all three of them sensed a coldness from their backs, and a life-threading sense of danger attacked their brains within a blink.</p> <p>Thus, all three of them instinctively tried to draw back.</p> <p>“Ah!” Two of them disappeared soon, while the poor one whose ankle was still held between Xie Dong’s teeth didn’t manage to step back and fell on the ground.</p> <p>At that moment, a transparent figure flashed across the air and sent a wave of wind blades toward the man. Only after that did Lin Qiao show her face.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>The man’s head was cut off before he could even see her clearly. He felt his head flying up, then thud against the ground. Before his consciousness dissipated, he could see his headless body.</p> <p>As the man’s head was cut off neatly, Xie Dong loosened his teeth. Then, he relaxed his whole body and lied on the ground. After staring at the sky for a few seconds, he turned to look at the zombie beside him.</p> <p>She was a meter away from him, with her back faced toward him, still wearing the loose-fitting camouflage. However, her messy hair were gone. Now, she was wearing a hat with a headband underneath it. He had also seen the glasses frame sitting over her ears.</p>",
  "Chapter 162: Give Up When the Enemy is Too Strong": "<p>Sensing Xie Dong’s gaze, Lin Qiao turned her head to glance at him, then turned back to keep staring at the two.</p> <p>Xie Dong paused on seeing her face.</p> <p><em>‘Where are her scars?’</em></p> <p>The two were stunned as well, staring at the suddenly appeared Lin Qiao, who had killed a level-five superpowered man once she showed up.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was wearing sunglasses and a hat. The two only saw her pointed jaw and tightened clothes at her chest area.</p> <p><em>‘A woman? A strange and powerful woman! On the enemy’s side!’</em></p> <p>“Who are you? What do you want?” One of the two men shouted at Lin Qiao. They had witnessed her kill the other man who was at level-five quite easily, so they figured that she might be a level-six powerful being!</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly looked at them without answering their questions. At that point, Xie Dong finally regained some strength, allowing him to hold the wall and slowly stand up.</p> <p>Hearing the noise he made, Lin Qiao turned back again. This time, she raised a hand to lower her sunglasses a little bit, revealing her pair of dark eyes to look at Xie Dong, who was covered in wounds, with pity.</p> <p>Xie Dong could see her eyes, but the two in front of her couldn’t.</p> <p>Xie Dong was wounded seriously, yet he didn’t feel any pain. However, as he was injured and his energy had been consumed up, he couldn’t control his body so well for the time being.</p> <p>Seeing the familiar eyes of Lin Qiao, he somehow felt relieved.</p> <p>Earlier on, he didn’t know that Lin Qiao was nearby. However, as he ran to this area, he suddenly had a feeling which seemed to lead him to her.</p> <p>At first, he didn’t know what that feeling was, but as he got closer, he faintly sensed a familiar vibe which was stronger than before, and was just nearby.</p> <p>Soon, he recognized that familiar vibe.</p> <p>It was Lin Qiao!</p> <p>Therefore, he saw a gleam of hope, because of which, he tried his best to run toward this area. He believed that if he got close enough, Lin Qiao would sense him, or, he would run to her side and she would save him.</p> <p>Since he and Lin Qiao were separated by the ice-powered zombie leader, Xie Dong had been extra careful. He was just a newborn zombie. He wasn’t strong enough, so he needed to avoid both human beings and high-level zombies.</p> <p>As a weak zombie, he had no other choice but to hide around. Two days ago, he encountered two level-four zombies who were fighting over territory. One of them was injured badly, but managed to escape. The winner was injured as well, so it didn’t chase.</p> <p>Xie Dong sneakily followed behind the injured zombie and grasped an opportunity to kill it with a surprise attack.</p> <p>However, once he dug out its zombie nucleus, a group of people showed up. At the sight of the zombie nucleus, those people decided to seize it. After confirming that Xie Dong was alone, they immediately surrounded him and tried to kill him.</p> <p>Fortunately, he was a zombie. Those people’s attacks were lethal to human beings, but not to him. At last, he got a chance to run. He wasn’t able to tell if he could really escape them, but he wouldn’t miss any opportunity available to him.</p> <p>Surprisingly, he ran into Lin Qiao so soon.</p> <p>After glancing at the poor Xie Dong, Lin Qiao silently pushed the sunglasses up to cover her eyes, then turned back to look at the two. At the moment, the people in the two cars didn’t know the twists that had taken place on the roof yet. None of them was stronger than the three on the roof, so they didn’t sense Lin Qiao as she had restrained her vibe.</p> <p>After waiting for a while, they guessed that the three on the roof had finished Xie Dong off. So, one of them shouted, “Boss, have you killed the boy? We’re three miles away from the center of the town. Let’s go and see if we can find any food there!’</p> <p>Hearing that, the people on the roof stayed silent.</p> <p>“Eh? Why are they so quiet? Have they finished? Are they preparing to come down?”</p> <p>“Why didn’t they answer the question?”</p> <p>“Boss? Are you there? Oi!”</p> <p>“Alright, stop yelling. You’re attracting zombies!” Another man reminded the guy who was shouting. As he mentioned, the surrounding ordinary zombies had started to slowly gather toward them.</p> <p>“How can my voice attract them… They’re coming because they smelled us.” While complaining, this man raised his gun and pointed it at the approaching zombies, then fired for a few times in a row.</p> <p>The nearest few zombies were shot in the heads and fell to the ground. Meanwhile, the others raised their guns to shoot zombies as well.</p> <p>“Eh, but what’s happening up there? They didn’t respond, neither have they come down. What are they doing?”</p> <p>At that moment, their Boss really wanted to yell back at them, ‘Finish my ass! We’re about to be finished!’</p> <p>The two men understood that Lin Qiao was much more powerful than they were, because she was able to silently come up behind three level-five superpowered men while they sensed nothing, and were nearly killed by her.</p> <p>The man who was bitten by Xie Dong was only two seconds slower than them, but as a result, his head was cut off within a blink. Perhaps, he didn’t even know how he died.</p> <p>Facing the huge power difference, the two level-five superpowered men were frightened. They would never think about avenging their dead friend, as they believed that was meaningless.</p> <p>People could die at any moment when they teamed up to come out of their bases. They were used to that since long ago, and they believed that they didn’t need to fight a level-six powerful being for someone they didn’t know so well.</p> <p>“Well, if that boy is your friend, we didn’t really do serious harm to him. And, you’ve killed one of us. So, I guess we’re even! You can take him. We won’t try stopping him this time.”</p> <p>A man said to Lin Qiao with a very different attitude. She glanced at him, then turned back to Xie Dong and gave him a special-forces’ hand signal.</p> <p><em>‘What’s the plan?’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong glanced at the headless body on the ground, then responded with a hand signal as well.</p> <p><em>‘Let’s go.’</em></p> <p>He still had the zombie nucleus, so he planned to deal with these people after he had upgraded himself. He had memorized their faces! He wouldn’t let Lin Qiao kill them for him, because he wanted to take revenge for himself.</p> <p>Receiving his hand signal, Lin Qiao didn’t say anything and just pressed a hand on his shoulder. In the next second, both of them flashed into her space.</p>",
  "Chapter 163: He Was Trapped": "<p>When Lin Qiao and Xie Dong suddenly disappeared, the two men glanced at each other with surprise. However, before they recovered from the shock, Lin Qiao showed up again. She walked to the head, bent over and picked it up, then turned to enter her space again; all this while, she completely ignored the two.</p> <p>Just now, she forgot to bring the head into her space. After entering her space, she recalled that the man she killed was a level-five superpowered one. Even though his energy nucleus wouldn’t be helpful to herself, she could always feed it to the vine plant in the lake.</p> <p><em>‘I can’t waste it!’</em></p> <p>She returned to her space with the head, then cut it open with her claws to dig out the energy nucleus and threw it into the lake. After that, she threw the head aside and washed her hands in a bucket by the lakeside. Then, she thought of the zombie nucleus she had obtained just now, so she stood up to rummage her pockets. After finding the zombie nucleus, she threw it into the lake as well.</p> <p>Since Junjun had started cooking in this area, she would always put a bucket by the lakeside with lake water in it. Sometimes, she would use it to water the plants, or simply pour the used water onto the grassland.</p> <p>Lin Qiao would no longer bath in the lake. Instead, she would fetch some water with a bucket for showering, or go out of her space to find an empty room to clean herself in it.</p> <p>She turned to look at Xie Dong who was sitting in a chair by the lake, and found that he was staring straight at the head which was cut into two by her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could tell that he wanted to eat the brain matter in that head. She turned to pick up a glass and filled it with lake water, walking over and handing it to him.</p> <p>Xie Dong took over the glass of water and drank it up. Lin Qiao watched him empty the glass, then got him another glass of water.</p> <p>After drinking the water, Xie Dong suddenly felt that his impulse to feed on that human head had been weakened. Li Qiao handed him the second glass of water and signaled for him to drink more.</p> <p>The lake water was effective for zombies. It had changed Junjun quite a lot, and Lin Qiao herself had benefited from it as well. It would be beneficial for Xie Dong to drink more of it for sure.</p> <p>Xie Dong took over the second glass of water. He had already finished one glass, so did he need to take another glass? He didn’t fully understand, but he still drank it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took the empty glass from his hand and then spoke out loud, “Rest…”</p> <p>Xie Dong paused slightly at first, then raised his head to look at her with shock. But by that moment, Lin Qiao had turned to exit her space.</p> <p>Back when Lin Qiao disappeared again with that head, the two level-five superpowered men finally realized what had happened and hurriedly leaped off the roof.</p> <p>Little did they know that not long after that, Lin Qiao showed up again. She quickly glanced at the two, then turned invisible and headed to the hotel where Lin Feng and his family were staying.</p> <p>As the two level-five superpowered men leaped down, the people in the two vehicles parked the car. They stuck their heads out of the car windows to look at the two who had landed on the car roof. They waited for a short while, but the third man never showed up. So, one of them began asking questions.</p> <p>“Eh? Where’s Zhao Lide? Boss, why didn’t he come down?”</p> <p>“Yeah, boss? Is the boy dead? Did you get the zombie nucleus?”</p> <p>Hearing them, the two men’s faces darkened. The one named Shen Chengming responded crossly, “He’s dead.” While speaking, he leaped off the car roof and sat in the front seat.</p> <p>His words stunned the others.</p> <p>“What happened? How did he die? Hadn’t the three of you been together this whole time?”</p> <p>“Yeah! And that boy was injured so badly. He couldn’t possibly kill Zhao Lide, could he?”</p> <p>“But the boy is a little strange. He seems to be a former special-forces soldier, as he has some skills that only special-forces soldiers can have.”</p> <p>“How did he die?”</p> <p>The group of people kept asking questions. The other man on the car roof was named Lv Duyao. He leaped down and said, “Let’s go! Zhao Lide is dead, so our strength has declined by twenty percent. We need to be more careful from now on.”</p> <p>He didn’t tell his teammates about how Zhao Lide died, but reminded them that the strength of the team had declined, and this journey would become more dangerous.</p> <p>After all the team members went back inside the cars and the drivers started driving again, Shen Chengming said, “The boy didn’t die. A powerful one showed up to save him. She killed Zhao Lide and cut off his head by the time we saw her. We didn’t even see her moves clearly.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was wearing a hat and a headband, but based on her snow-white skin, pointed chin, and full breasts, both Shen Chengming, and Lv Duyao could tell that she was a female.</p> <p>And judging by her chin, mouth, and nose, they figured that she was rather pretty. They just couldn’t see her eyes, and didn’t know what the pair of eyes behind her sunglasses would look like.</p> <p>Hearing his words, the few people in Shen Chengming’s car stared at him with surprise and asked, “What? Even you didn’t see how she killed Zhao Lide? Is that person really so powerful? Even you level-five guys couldn’t sense her?”</p> <p>“Who is she? If she’s really so powerful, she must be quite famous in the base. Who is she?”</p> <p>“Yeah, yeah! We didn’t hear any noise from here, but why did he suddenly die? Why are you two unharmed then? Was she here to save the boy?”</p> <p>Shen Chengming nodded and said, “None of us sensed her when she approached. By the time we sensed her, she was already behind us… less than two meters away. Fortunately, Lv Duyao and I dodged quickly. Otherwise, our heads would have been chopped off as well.”</p> <p>“That powerful! She actually came up behind you soundlessly? But boss, since you had sensed her, there was no reason for Zhao Lide not to sense her, was there?”</p> <p>The three of them were at the same level, so even if Zhao Lide was relatively slower, he should have ended up better than being beheaded.</p> <p>“He was trapped,” said Shen Chengming, “Back then, he was stepping on the boy. The boy bit him on the ankle and never relaxed the bite. That’s why he didn’t manage to dodge.”</p> <p>Zhao Lide brought death to himself. If he hadn’t trampled on Xie Dong, the latter wouldn’t have bit his ankle; and if Xie Dong didn’t bite him, he would have been able to move away quickly.</p> <p>He had wind power, so he would certainly have been able to dodge quicker than the other two. However, he trampled on Xie Dong’s chest, so the latter bit him and never relaxed the bite.</p> <p>By doing what he did, Zhao Lide got himself killed.</p> <p>“So, he was killed because the boy bit his ankle and didn’t let him dodge?” The others could scarcely believe it.</p> <p>Zhao Lide was one of the strongest three in the team, but he had died. The people in Shen Chengming’s car didn’t have many feelings about his death. Instead, they just felt pity for losing a powerful teammate.</p> <p>Shen Chengming nodded and didn’t say much.</p> <p>“Well, then… How did you survive? Since she was able to show up behind you without catching your attention, she must be incredibly powerful. Who is she?”</p> <p>“A woman,” said Shen Chengming. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen her in the base. We managed to escape because she let us. She didn’t attack us. I think she’s a level-six superpowered one. I just can’t tell if she has space power.”</p> <p>Both him and Lv Duyao saw Lin Qiao disappear. Typically, only space-powered creatures were able to do that.</p>",
  "Chapter 164: One More Zombie": "<p>Unlike the people in Shen Chengming’s car, the people in the other car were sad. Lv Duyao told the others about what happened, then knitted his brows and showed a grim look.</p> <p>Zhao Lide was their deputy captain. Their cooperation with Shen Chengming’s team was temporary. Back in the base, they often saw Shen Chengming and his people, but didn’t know them so well.</p> <p>Their deputy captain died this time, and because of his death, their team was weakened greatly. Due to this reason, their actions out of the base would be limited.</p> <p>“Who was that? If he’s really so powerful, we should have all heard his name in the base, right?” someone asked.</p> <p>Lv Duyao shook his head and responded, “A woman, wearing a hat and sunglasses… looked quite strange. I never saw her in the base.”</p> <p>“A woman! Among all level six and seven superpowered ones in our base, only Deputy Chief Yan is a woman. Is she here?” One of the others asked with surprise.</p> <p>Lv Duyao shook his head again and said, “It wasn’t Deputy Chief Yan. We all know Deputy Chief Yan. But that woman… I don’t know her.”</p> <p>The others glanced at each other, wondering who that mysterious woman was.</p> <p>On the other side, Qiu Lili and Junjun soon arrived at the entrance of the hotel building. The former sniffed at the hotel, then began walking in. After taking two steps, she stopped and turned to look at Junjun, who was standing by the entrance.</p> <p>“Ah-ya.”<br/>\n‘Let’s go,’ she said.</p> <p>Junjun carried Tongtong and glanced at the broken gate of the hotel, then at the boy in her arms. There were human beings in that building. Suddenly, she didn’t want to get close to those human beings. She pictured those people surrounding her and staring at her, and felt uncomfortable.</p> <p>Only after Qiu Lili called her did she start walking into the building.</p> <p>They walked into the lobby. Qiu Lili didn’t like walking on the dusty floor, preferring to leap through roofs or treetops. But this time, in order to protect Junjun and Tongtong, she had no choice but to walk on the ground with them.</p> <p>When walking in, they found that there were no zombies in the building. When they were still hundreds of meters away, Qiu Lili had sensed that some zombies were in this area. But by now, those zombies had all hidden because they felt her vibe.</p> <p>Lin Hao and the others were all upstairs at the moment, so no one was left in the lobby. Therefore, before Qiu Lili got close, the surviving zombies in this building had again started following the scents of the group of human beings.</p> <p>However, before they located the group of living human beings, they sensed the incoming Qiu Lili, a zombie queen. After that, those zombies forgot about those human beings and left as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Some zombies went upstairs in panic and ended up being finished by Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>Wei Jingchen, who was guarding before a door, saw a zombie coming upstairs. Once the zombie showed its face from the corner of the stairs, he fired his gun.</p> <p>As a guard, he was responsible for dealing with all the zombies that showed up on this floor. The others were either in their rooms or searching through the building for useful things.</p> <p>However, his bullet was caught by a slim hand.</p> <p>Only after that did Wei Jingchen recognize Qiu Lili, the young female zombie in a clean white dress.</p> <p>“Ah!” Qiu Lili angrily roared at Wei Jingchen then threw the bullet at him. Anyone could be pissed off by a sudden gunshot.</p> <p>Wei Jingchen was tall and sturdy, yet he was a simple and honest man. Seeing Qiu Lili, he realized that he had shot the wrong zombie. So, on hearing her angry roar, he hurriedly dropped his gun and rubbed his head while looking at Qiu Lili without knowing what to do.</p> <p>He surely knew this young female zombie. Earlier on, he and the others witnessed her drive Yang Jianhua away. He wanted to apologize to her, but then he remembered that she was a zombie. He didn’t feel right saying sorry to a zombie.</p> <p>At that point, Junjun came upstairs with Tongtong in her arms.</p> <p>Wei Jingchen fixed his eyes on Junjun once she showed up. The little boy was resting his head on her shoulder, so Wei Jingchen couldn’t see his face.</p> <p>He confusedly looked at Junjun, then turned his eyes to Tongtong. He was sure that Junjun was a zombie, but he had never seen a zombie carrying a child before. He assumed that the boy was a zombie too.</p> <p>“Ahh!” Seeing him staring at Tongtong, Qiu Lili growled at him again, then turned to the corridor on the other side with Tongtong. They picked a relatively cleaner room and walked in.</p> <p>At the moment, the door guarded by Wei Jingchen was opened from the inside. Lin Wenwen stuck her head out to look around, then asked him, “I just heard some strange noises. Did zombies come up?”</p> <p>Wei Jingchen stopped rubbing his head and dropped his hand instantly while responding, “Ah, yeah, some zombies came up. It was the young female zombie who has fought Yang Jianhua, and another female zombie who’s with a child.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen’s eyes glowed. “That young female zombie is back? What about that one with sunglasses? Why is there another female zombie?”</p> <p>Wei Jingchen shook his head and said, “I didn’t see him.”</p> <p>“Where did the two zombies go?” Lin Wenwen looked around and asked.</p> <p>“That room,” Wei Jingchen pointed at the door of the room which Qiu Lili and Junjun had just gotten in and replied. Lin Wenwen glanced at that area, then nodded and went back into her room.</p> <p>Back in the room, the others all looked at her.</p> <p>“What’s going on?” Asked Mrs. Lin. Lin Wenwen walked toward the couch while saying, “Ah, Jingchen says that he saw the young female zombie who fought Yang Jianhua yesterday. She was with another female zombie.”</p> <p>“Eh? Another zombie?” Cheng Wangxue asked curiously, “Can she understand our words like the one with sunglasses?”</p> <p>“I don’t know,” Lin Wenwen shook her head and said, “I didn’t see her. I heard that she’s with a child. I wonder if the child is a zombie as well.”</p> <p>Neither Lin Wenwen nor Wei Jingchen would think the child in the female zombie’s arms was a human being, because that kind of thing would never happen normally. They believed that the child would have been eaten long ago if he or she were a human being.</p> <p>They subconsciously chose to think in a normal way. But sometimes, things just wouldn’t happen in normal ways.</p> <p>Long Qingying was in the room too, but she kept silent. She surely knew that the child was a human being, and that he had been raised up quite well by the few zombies. She was rather curious about how the group of human beings would react when they found out that the child was a living human being.</p>",
  "Chapter 165: What’s the Plan?": "<p>Yuan Tianxing had slept for a whole night before waking up just now. As he opened his eyes to see a strange ceiling, he automatically looked around. Only after confirming that this place was safe did he turn to the others.</p> <p>Long Qingying was listening to the conversation with her katana carried in her arms when she noticed that Yuan Tianxing was awake. She looked at him and said, “Deputy Chief is awake.”</p> <p>Hearing that, the others immediately turned to Yuan Tianxing. Lin Feng, Lin Wenwen, and the other few stood up and walked toward the bed.</p> <p>“Tianxing, you’re awake! How do you feel now?” Lin Wen looked at him with concern.</p> <p>“Yeah, Brother Tianxing,” said Lin Wenwen, “you are covered in injuries. How’re you feeling?” Looking at these familiar people, Yuan Tianxing relaxed his vigilance. He supported his body with his arms to sit up, then leaned against the headboard.</p> <p>“I’m fine. Are you all fine?” He turned to look around and asked, “Where is this place?”</p> <p>Lin Feng dragged a chair to the bedside, then sat down and said, “This is a room of a grand hotel, not far away from where we were yesterday. Your injuries are quite bad, so we didn’t dare to travel far. Instead, we just found a place to stay for the night.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded. He felt much better than yesterday, and he guessed that it was because he had had a good rest.</p> <p>“Thank you. I’m fine,” he said. “We can leave today if you want to. We should go to the Sea City Base first, then see what we can do. What plan do you have next?”</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at the others, then sighed and responded, “Be patient. We plan to let you heal first. As for the future… we are all who managed to escape. For building a new base, we’re terribly short-handed. But, it’s not impossible. We don’t plan to join the Sea City Base, but we still need to find Li Zheng and the others. We don’t know how many of them have survived.”</p> <p>Their first plan was to build a base to settle down. They needed to build a fence wall first, then find enough food and supplies. They were just a few people, so they wouldn’t consume too much food and supplies. However, it would be a little difficult for them to build an over ten-meter-tall fence wall.</p> <p>Even though Yuan Tianxing’s earth power was highly helpful, he needed to heal before the construction started.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing thought for a moment, then felt that Lin Feng was right. So, he nodded and said, “There’re too many zombies outside. It’s dangerous for us, and we have a few injured ones who need help and rest. How long do you plan to stay here.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen smiled and said, “Brother Tianxing, don’t worry about zombies. Du Yuanxing, Lin Hao, and the others have cleaned the zombies in this building. We can use solar power in this place, and we have found quite some food. I think we can even stay here for one or two months. As for my brother, he’s not injured as badly as you are. He feels much better now. In just a couple of days, he’ll recover fully. We don’t know what kind of water the zombie with the sunglasses gave him, but it did have strong healing power.”</p> <p>In fact, she wanted to tell Yuan Tianxing that since they didn’t want to join the Sea City Base and intended to build a new base, the new base could be located anywhere, like here.</p> <p>Last night, the group of people had discussed and decided to stay here for now, because this place with food and solar power was suitable for living.<br/>\nAs long as they built the fence wall, they wouldn’t need to be afraid of zombie crowds.</p> <p>“As long as the zombie named Lu Tianyu and his friends are here, the others zombies won’t dare to get close,” Long Qingying said abruptly.<br/>\nAfter spending a couple of days with Lin Qiao and her friends, she now clearly know what they could do to ordinary zombies.</p> <p>She believed that the zombie named Lu Tianyu wouldn’t mind staying here to scare away the other zombies, since he wanted to help Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>Hearing her, the others had their eyes glowed.</p> <p>They had all seen how the other zombies avoided that zombie when he was with them earlier on. If he could join them to live in this place, they might really not need to worry about the other zombies.</p> <p>However, there was one problem—none of them knew about the few strange zombies. Those zombies showed up suddenly to help them, but they couldn’t tell what their real purpose was.</p> <p>Those zombies looked as smart as human beings. So, if they really had some bad intentions, it would be extremely dangerous for the group of human beings to keep them around!</p> <p>The group of human beings just didn’t understand why those zombies went all way to the South and then followed them back here. Moreover, right when they were in the worst situation, they showed up to save them. Why did they do that? What purpose did they have?</p> <p>Lin Feng and his people didn’t relax their vigilance against those zombies, and that was perfectly normal. Anyone wouldn’t trust the people who showed up suddenly to help them without any reason. After all in the apocalyptic era, kind people couldn’t live for long. People had become selfish for survival, and that was perfectly normal.</p> <p>Therefore, if they wanted to use those zombies to scare away the other zombies, they would have to figure out who they were and what they wanted.</p> <p>They didn’t want another Yang Jianhua. They couldn’t afford to be fooled again.</p> <p>This group of people understood that they needed to find out more about those zombies, just not knowing how.</p> <p>“Do you know where are they from?” Lin Wenwen looked at Long Qingying and asked. The latter thought for a moment and then said uncertainly, “I think they went South from Sea City. Since they’ve made a roundtrip, I guess they’ve heard something in Sea City, then went South to confirm it. In the South, they ran into us, so they decided to get close to us for information. It seemed that they knew we didn’t know them before.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded and said, “Perhaps, they saved you and came here along with you to find us, because they were worried that we might reject them. They brought you here so you can connect them and us. I’ve never seen a zombie which is as smart as human beings before, and one of them is a scary zombie queen. If that female zombie wants to kill us, she doesn’t need to spend so much time to get close to us. What on earth do they want?”</p> <p>“He has been claiming that he’s here to help you since the beginning. And he said that he used to be Great Captain’s subordinate,” said Long Qingying.</p> <p>“They really seem to be helping us. But, why don’t I remember a subordinate like him?” Said Lin Feng.</p> <p>Long Qingying thought for a moment and continued, “Maybe you just don’t recognize him because he’s disfigured.” The others glanced at each other and felt that it could be possible.</p> <p>However, Lin Feng shook his head and said, “No, he said that his name is Lu Tianyu. I don’t know anyone named Lu Tianyu.”</p> <p>“Maybe your memory is declining because you’re getting old, so you don’t remember him,” Mrs. Lin made a joke.</p>",
  "Chapter 166: The Zombie with Big Breasts Shows Up": "<p>As the people in the room were trying to guess Lin Qiao’s purpose, Lin Qiao and Xie Dong had been heading toward the hotel building speedily. After arriving at the gate of the hotel, she looked around and carefully listened to all sorts of sounds in the building, then walked in.</p> <p>She sensed that most of the people were in a few rooms on the fourth floor, and so was Qiu Lili and Junjun. She also sensed that no other zombies existed from the fourth to the seventh floor. The zombies in the building had either run downstairs or further upstairs.</p> <p>As long as Qiu Lili, the zombie queen, released a bit of her vibe, the other zombies wouldn’t dare to get close.</p> <p>Walking to the entrance of the building, she abruptly turned to look back. Under her sunglasses, her eyes sparkled with a cold light. After that, she turned around and walked into the lobby.</p> <p>She walked upstairs and saw a man guarding by the stairway on the third floor.</p> <p>“Stop, who are you?” Su Liang, one of the five soldiers who didn’t have superpowers, stared down alertly on sensing her approach. Lin Qiao didn’t try hiding herself, but slowed down and made some noises to inform Su Liang about her coming.</p> <p>Seeing the strange person wearing a hat, sunglasses, and camouflages, Su Liang immediately shouted out to stop him from coming closer. After all, he and his people had occupied this place. According to the apocalyptic rule, the people who arrived after them couldn’t come up without their permission, in case the latecomers had some bad intentions.</p> <p>Su Ling looked at Lin Qiao and felt that her sunglasses seemed quite familiar.</p> <p>He could tell that she was a female. Even though a big half of her face was covered by the brim of her hat and her sunglasses, the loose-fitting camouflage top couldn’t hide her full breasts.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him, then abruptly took off her sunglasses and raised her head to show him her eyes.</p> <p>“You… You are…” Seeing her face and eyes, Du Liang widened his eyes to stare at her. He wanted to ask her some questions, yet he wasn’t able to.</p> <p>He and his teammates had seen those eyes yesterday. No wonder he felt that her sunglasses looked familiar. Wasn’t this the zombie who stole their Great Captain and gave a few cups of water to their Deputy Chief?</p> <p>But… but…Wasn’t that a male zombie? Before, the zombie’s face was covered in scars, but those scars were gone now… And the zombie became a female?</p> <p>Du Liang fixed his eyes on Lin Qiao’s chest. He was sure that the zombie he saw yesterday had a flat chest. How did he become a female with huge breasts over one night?</p> <p>Seeing him staring at her chest, Lin Qiao glanced down at her own chest, then said, “Have… you… seen… enough?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Su Liang’s eyes opened even wider. He gaped his mouth, wanting to say something, but couldn’t utter any sound.</p> <p><em>‘It’s a zombie indeed… But, is it the same zombie we saw yesterday? But it’s really a zombie… a zombie… zombie…’</em></p> <p>“Ah!” All of a sudden, Su Liang burst in screams and turned to run upstairs.</p> <p><em>‘Damn it! How can it possibly talk if it’s a zombie! What the hell!’</em></p> <p>“Ahhhh!” While yelling, Su Liang ran up to the fourth floor and bumped into Xing Le and the other few who rushed over after hearing his screams.</p> <p>“Stop yelling!” Being startled by Su Liang who darted up as if he had seen a ghost, Xing Le raised a gun to point down at the stairs. The squad leader named Lu Junjie, who was guarding the fifth floor, rushed down as well, leaning his head forward to look down. He thought that some powerful zombie had shown up, but only saw a person wearing a baseball hat slowly coming upstairs.</p> <p>He leaped over the staircase alertly, then raised his gun to point down at that person and yelled, “Who’s down there!”</p> <p>With his eyes fixed on the one with a baseball hat, he asked Su Liang with a low voice, “What ‘s going on? Is it him who frightened you?”</p> <p>Su Liang started to calm down as his friends showed up. He pointed at Lin Qiao who had walked around the corner and said, “She… she, she… she’s a zombie!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was wearing the same camouflage suit that she wore yesterday, as well as the same pair of sunglasses. But today, she also wore a hat.</p> <p>Seeing her, Xing Le sighed in relief. After that, he dropped his gun and turned to complain to Su Liang, “Isn’t this the zombie who told us to come here yesterday? He’s just wearing a hat. Why did you scream?”</p> <p>Hearing his words, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but roll her eyes. She had already put the sunglasses back on, so the few people couldn’t see her doing that.</p> <p>Lu Junjie was still raising his gun, and the look on his face changed a little. “Xing Le, look carefully!” He said, “This is a woman. She has breasts. And there are no scars on her face!”</p> <p>“Eh?” Xing Le paused slightly, then turned to Lin Qiao again. As Lu Junjie had said, the zombie they saw yesterday was flat-chased, and had large scars on his face, but this one in front of them had large breasts.</p> <p>The female figure was of the same height as the zombie they saw yesterday, so Xing Le didn’t notice the differences between them just now.</p> <p>He quivered and pointed his gun at Lin Qiao as quickly as possible.</p> <p>At that moment, Su Liang finally calmed down. He waved his hands to his friends, then said, “No, no… I was trying to say that she can talk! She’s a zombie but she can talk!”</p> <p>Hearing his words, the other two immediately turn to look at him as if he was crazy.</p> <p><em>‘Can a zombie possibly talk? Are you kidding us? How can that possibly happen?’</em></p> <p>Looking at the three men in front of her, Lin Qiao felt that they wouldn’t let her pass until she showed them some proof.</p> <p>As she prepared to enter her space to pick up the cup that both Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing had used, and bring it out to show them, an unhappy roar was suddenly heard.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n<em>‘Stay out of the way!’</em></p> <p>Only Lin Qiao understood the meaning of that roar, while the other three just turned back to look at Qiu Lili in shock. The latter was pouting while staring at the three of them, her hands resting on her hips as if the three men had really blocked her way.</p> <p>Maybe because of Qiu Lili’s strong vibe, the three men without superpowers automatically took two steps backward on seeing the look on her face. At that point, Lin Qiao walked upstairs. She pushed Su Liang and Xing Le aside, then walked through.</p> <p>The three men who had no idea what was happening stood there stunned, watching Qiu Lili hold Lin Qiao’s hands and lead her to the room she had picked.</p>",
  "Chapter 167: The Talking Zombie": "<p>After taking two steps forward, Lin Qiao abruptly stopped and turned back, then slightly lowered her sunglasses and showed her pair of black eyes.</p> <p>“Go…tell…your…leader, I…need…to…talk…to…them…” She said a few words slowly, then turned and walked into the room with Qiu Lili. Xing Le and the other two gazed at the two zombies for a few seconds, then realized what they had just heard and glanced at each other, their eyes filled with disbelief.</p> <p>“What did she just say?” Lu Junjie asked uncertainly.</p> <p>Xing Le responded, “I think…she asked us to tell our leader that she’s gonna talk to them?”</p> <p>Then, both Lu Junjie and Xing Le turned to Su Liang, as they could scarcely believe what they had heard. Su Liang nodded at them and said, “Captain, go tell them.”</p> <p>Lu Junjie thought for a moment, then carried the gun on his back and said to Xing Le, “Xing Le, you go upstairs.”</p> <p>Then, he turned and headed to Lin Feng’s room.</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” Xing Le responded, then ran upstairs with his gun to guard the floor. Lu Junjie walked to the door of Lin Feng’s room. Wei Jingchen, who guarded by the door, asked, “Why did Su Liang scream?”</p> <p>“He saw a ghost!” Lu Junjie replied.</p> <p>“Great Captain!” He knocked the door.</p> <p>“Come in!” Someone in the room responded. Lu Junjie pushed the door open and walked in, leaving Wei Jingchen with confusion.</p> <p>Once in, Lu Junjie walked to Lin Feng and the others, then said, “The zombie with sunglasses is here. It wants to talk to you.”</p> <p>Hearing that, the others all turned to him.</p> <p>“Is it the one named Lu Tianyu? Where is he now?” Lin Feng asked.</p> <p>“Yes,” Lu Junjie nodded and said, “It’s in the two female zombies’ room, but…”</p> <p>“What?” As Lu Junjie stuttered, Yuan Tianxing, who had gotten off the bed and was now resting on the couch, couldn’t help but ask.</p> <p>“It…It has become a female…” Lu Junjie said with hesitation. “…And the scars on its face are gone. Now, it looks just like a healthy human being if you ignore its eyes.”</p> <p>The others stared at him with surprise, seeming to doubt their own ears. Even the composed Long Qingying had slightly widened her eyes and showed the same look as the others.</p> <p>“Female? That’s impossible! Yesterday, all of us saw that he had a flat chest. It wasn’t tall, but its chest was flat indeed. Tell me I’m not the only one who saw its flat chest!” Cheng Wangxue looked at the others and said.</p> <p>Lin Feng, Yuan Tianxing, Mrs. Lin, Long Qingying, Lin Wenwen, and Lin Xiaolu, who didn’t know what exactly they were talking about, all nodded at her, because they had all seen that zombie’s flat chest.</p> <p>Suddenly, Lin Wenwen turned to Long Qingying and said, “Qingying, didn’t you meet those zombies earlier than us? Did you know that it’s a female zombie?”</p> <p>Long Qingying soon calmed back down, and the surprised look in her face disappeared, as if she wasn’t shocked at all. “I didn’t know. But, it didn’t look like a female zombie at least,” she said blandly.</p> <p>She spent a while thinking. That zombie’s hair were shorter than that of some men, and its face was covered in scars. It liked to wear Du Yuanxing’s sunglasses, and most importantly, its chest was flat.</p> <p>Everybody saw its flat chest!</p> <p>Mrs. Lin turned to look at Lu Junjie and ask, “Junjie, are you sure?”</p> <p>Lu Junjie nodded and said, “Yeah, Liang and Le saw it too.”</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Feng suddenly thought of the woman’s figure which had emerged in his head when he was picturing that zombie’s face.</p> <p><em>‘It can’t be…’ </em>he thought.</p> <p>The roomful of people were all shocked by the news, and didn’t manage to process it yet. Only Yuan Tianxing cooled down soon and said to Lu Junjie, “Junjie, go tell them that we can talk to them at any time they want.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir…right away!” Lu Junjie responded immediately. While speaking, he turned to walk outside; but after taking a few steps, he turned back around, then looked at the others and said, “Eh… there’s…another thing…”</p> <p>The others looked at him bewilderedly. “What is it? Just tell us.”</p> <p>“Eh…that…” Lu Junjie said awkwardly, “Lu Tianyu can talk!”</p> <p>Earlier on, he had almost forgotten about this.</p> <p>The others fell in silence, wondering if they had misheard.</p> <p>“She…Isn’t she a zombie?” Mrs. Lin asked with confusion.</p> <p>“Her eyes are still as black as a zombie’s …” Lu Junjie said to clarify. However, he couldn’t tell for sure if Lin Qiao was still a zombie or not!</p> <p>Had anyone ever seen a zombie with a clean and pretty face like some human being? No! Some zombies had their faces undamaged, but they all had large dark circles under their eyes, just like that young female zombie…</p> <p>Had anyone ever seen a zombie which would save human beings? No! People believed that zombies fed on human beings.</p> <p>Had anyone seen a zombie which could change its gender? No! Had that zombie evolved into some kind of higher level creature?</p> <p>Had anyone ever seen a talking zombie? Absolutely not!</p> <p>This roomful of people just wanted a quiet moment at that point. They didn’t understand what was going on with the world! Why could a zombie talk?</p> <p>“Was she pretending to be a zombie yesterday?” Lin Wenwen said. “Maybe, she’s a human being?”</p> <p>“I’ve seen her easily cut open the other zombies’ heads with her fingernails. I don’t think normal human beings can do that. And, her eyes look authentic. Not even cosmetic contact lens can make her eyes look like that,” Long Qingying said calmly.</p> <p>“Grandma, what are cosmetic contact lens?” Lin Xiaolu asked Mrs. Lin with a low voice.</p> <p>“Just one type of contact lens that can change the color of your eyes,” Mrs. Lin answered her question, also with a low voice.</p> <p>“Okay…” Lin Xiaolu responded, not seeming to understand fully.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing, who was still wearing a composed look, turned to Lu Junjie and said, “Alright, invite them here now.” He glanced at the others and felt that it was better to let everyone see the zombies themselves instead of letting them guess around here.</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” Lu Junjie replied. This time, he turned and walked out without stopping, heading over to Lin Qiao’s room immediately.</p> <p>As Yuan Tianxing sent Lu Junjie to invite the zombies, the others instantly quieted down, even somewhat expectant about seeing Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Furthermore, they couldn’t help but start imagining the zombie’s unscarred face.</p>",
  "Chapter 168: Ear-piercing Evil noise": "<p>Qiu Lili guided Lin Qiao into the room she had picked. It was a double room, neither large nor small. Once in, Lin Qiao saw Junjun playing with Tongtong on the bed.</p> <p>The rooms had been roughly neatened, now looking quite clean and tidy. All blankets were aired by the window side.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that Qiu Lili must have done all this once she came here, because she loved things clean, and was a diligent, good zombie.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao came into the room, both Junjun and Tongtong turned to her,</p> <p>She took off her hat. For some reason, after the last treatment in the lake, her body was now able to sense temperature. It was noon time, so she actually felt a little hot wearing the hat and the headband.</p> <p>Therefore, she took off the hat and headband regardless of her bald head. Both Qiu Lili and Junjun had seen her bald head anyway.</p> <p>However, as she exposed her bald head, the others fixed their eyes on it. Junjun wanted to laugh, but felt that she shouldn’t, while Qiu Lili and Tongtong both stared curiously.</p> <p><em>‘I need to get used to this…get used to this…’ </em>Lin Qiao thought repeatedly.</p> <p>Qiu Lili gazed at Lin Qiao’s head while getting closer and closer to her. Then, she silently reached a hand toward it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao flinched in response. Failing to touch her head, Qiu Liil pouted and mumbled, “Ahyayayaya…”</p> <p><em>‘Let me touch it…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao remained silent. Meanwhile, Qiu Lili reached her hand further toward the former’s head and finally touched it.</p> <p>After that, she shouted happily, “Ahya!”</p> <p><em>‘So smooth!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little speechless.</p> <p>“Mom…I want…head…” At that moment, Tongtong suddenly dragged Junjun’s sleeve with one hand and pointed at Lin Qiao’s bald head with the other.</p> <p>“Hah!” Junjun finally couldn’t help but laugh out.</p> <p><em>‘Are these two kids rising in rebellion?’ </em>Lin Qiao thought. Without saying anything, she put the hat back on. Seeing her put on the hat and cover her bald head, Tontong was unhappy.</p> <p>“Whoo… Ma…I want the…the head…” He mumbled to Junjun.</p> <p>Junjun looked at him helplessly while shaking her head. She wanted very much to tell him that he couldn’t touch Lin Qiao’s head, because she might get angry and eat him. However, she couldn’t talk at the moment. All she could do was shake her head at Tongtong.</p> <p>Then, something horrible happened.</p> <p>“Whoooo… I want it… Whaaaaa….” A thunderous crying was heard in the room. Lin Qiao was nearly freaked out by the scarily loud crying sound. Qiu Lili immediately covered her ears with her hands and hid in a corner.</p> <p>The boy’s crying sound was earth-shaking!</p> <p>“Whooooo…Ahhhh…I want it! I want it…. Whaaaaa….”</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that her eardrums were actually torn by the evil noise!</p> <p>Two seconds later, Qiu Lili darted toward the window, then leaped out and disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>“Whaaaa…I want it! Ma! I want it…Whooo…” Tongtong didn’t care if Qiu Lili has disappeared or not. He just really wanted to touch that egg-like bald head of Lin Qiao, so he wouldn’t stop crying.</p> <p>To Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili who were both very sensitive to sounds, his crying was torturous. No wonder Qiu Lili directly leaped out of the window.</p> <p>Hearing the head-blowing, evil crying sound, Lin Qiao angrily took off her hat and threw it at the couch. Then, she walked to Tongtong and closed her eyes while bending over to reach her head to him.</p> <p><em>‘Touch it! Just touch it! Please stop crying!’</em></p> <p>On the other side, some relatively powerful human beings had heard Tongtong’s cry too, even though the sound insulation of the walls in this hotel building was quite satisfactory.</p> <p>Soon after Lu Junjie left the room, the few in the room who were at level-four or above all heard a child’s crying.</p> <p>“Eh? Am I hearing a child’s cry?” Lin Qiao looked at the others and asked. Yuan Tianxing nodded with agreement and said, “I heard it too! But, I think Xiaolu is the only kid in this place, right?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen looked around and said with confusion, “Yeah! Where is that kid from?”</p> <p>The group of people looked at each other.</p> <p>Long Qingying knew who the child was. However, she didn’t say anything but watched the others wearing the bewildered looks. Meanwhile, she also wondered why the kid was crying so loudly.</p> <p>Lu Junjie, who had nearly walked to the door of Qiu Lili’s room, heard something as well. He paused and looked around with confusion, then felt that the crying sound was coming from the zombies’ room.</p> <p>He couldn’t hear it clearly, so he wasn’t so sure.</p> <p>Back in Qiu Lili’s room, when Lin Qiao reached her head to Tongtong, the latter immediately stopped crying.</p> <p>The little boy burped, then stared at Lin Qiao’s head for a little while. Only after that did he reached out his little hands to touch it. After that, he couldn’t keep his hands off her head.</p> <p>Feeling the pair of little hands running over her head over and over again, Lin Qiao complained internally, <em>‘I don’t like this boy! Wu Yueling is so much more adorable than him! I miss that little one so much!’</em></p> <p>Junjun smilingly watched Tongtong fondling Lin Qiao’s head. As he was almost satisfied, she hurriedly carried the boy away because she had sensed that someone was outside the door.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed it too. She turned to walk to the door and opened it before Lu Junjie knocked on it.</p> <p>Lu Junjie, who was raising a hand to knock on the door, paused when the door was opened. Then, he saw a bald-headed zombie staring at him from behind the sunglasses.</p> <p><em>‘Where is this bald one from?’ </em>He wondered.</p> <p>Seeing Lu Junjie’s confused look, Lin Qiao took off her sunglasses, then rubbed her bald head and asked awkwardly, “How…can…I…help…”</p> <p>The little boy was crying too loud just now, so she forgot to put her hat on before opening the door. Anyway, nothing too bad would happen even if she let Lu Junjie see her bald head. At the very least, her bald head looked much better than a scarred face.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s voice, Lu Junjie finally recognized her. He stared at the latter and said, “Eh…Your hair…!”</p> <p>He was going to ask Lin Qiao where her hair went, but then he realized that it was inappropriate to ask that question, as the latter was a female.</p> <p>He gazed at Lin Qiao’s pretty face, dark eyes, and bald head. It would be a little more acceptable for a man to look like this, but for a girl…</p> <p>He calmed himself down, then coughed slightly and said, “So… our Deputy Chief has invited you to their room to talk about the future plans. Is it… convenient for you?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded in response without thinking.</p>",
  "Chapter 169: Familiar Vibe": "<p>Lin Qiao didn’t open the door entirely, so Lu Junjie didn’t see Junjun and Tongtong, who were behind the door. But at that point, Tongtong said something.</p> <p>“Mom, I’m hungry.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced back at the little boy and realized that it was dinner time, and the kid should eat.</p> <p>Lu Junji stared at Lin Qiao with both surprise and doubt. He tried to lean his head forward to look inside the room; meanwhile, he said with disbelief, “Is someone else in there?”</p> <p>In fact, he wanted to ask if there was a child in the room. However, as he heard the child call ‘Mom’, he figured that more than two living beings were in that room.</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened the door entirely; nothing needed to be kept secret anyway. She needed to find a way to stay around Lin Feng and the others, so she couldn’t let them suspect her of having ill intentions. Without question, she wouldn’t keep any member on her side secret from them, as they all needed to meet each other at some point.</p> <p>Once the door was opened, Lu Junjie saw a female zombie carrying a little boy. The boy’s arms were put around the zombie’s neck.</p> <p>“Ma, I’m hungry.”</p> <p>As Lin Qiao opened the door, Junjun alertly turned toward the stranger outside.</p> <p>Seeing a living human child being carried in a zombie’s arms, Lu Junjie automatically tried to rush into the room. In his eyes, it was way too dangerous for the kid to stay with a zombie.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stopped him with a hand, then said with a flat tone and a bland expression, “Don’t… worry…”</p> <p>Lu Junjie stared at Tongtong and said, “You’ll lose control and eat him!”</p> <p>Zombies liked children’s flesh the most, as it was tender and soft. Even the higher level zombies which only fed on human hearts would eat children.</p> <p>Lin Qiao kept him outside the room and continued slowly, “We…won’t… We…don’t…eat…human…”</p> <p>Lu Junjie was nearly driven crazy by Lin Qiao’s talking speed. However, as she wouldn’t let him in, he had no choice but to give up and step back.</p> <p>“You really won’t hurt him?” He asked Lin Qiao, his faced filled with doubts, “He’s a child! It’s too dangerous for him to be with you!”</p> <p>Lu Junjie was worried that if someday Lin Qiao and Junjun lost control of themselves and let their zombie instincts win, they might eat the boy, as he was so close with them.</p> <p>He suddenly recalled that earlier on, he had heard from Wei Jingchen that the young female zombie showed up with another female zombie who was carrying a kid. Back then, he and the others had thought that the kid was a zombie too.</p> <p>Lin Qiao waved her hand toward Lu Junjie to let him know that that kind of thing would never happen. Not to mention the fact that Junjun was clear-minded and still had her maternity, as long as she was with Lin Qiao, the lake water from the latter’s space could keep her from losing control.</p> <p>Lu Junjie looked at Lin Qiao doubtfully, then glanced at her bald head. After that, he took a step backward and said, “When do you have time then? Our Deputy Chief is expecting you.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at him, then pointed at Lin Feng’s room to let him know that she could go there right now. Then, she turned back to crook her fingers toward Junjun, signaling for her to follow.</p> <p>She didn’t know where Qiu Lili had gone to, and she didn’t want to leave Junjun and Tongtong here alone, as neither of them had any fighting capacity.</p> <p>Receiving her hand signal, Junjun carried Tongtong and slowly came out of the room. She understood Lin Qiao’s meaning, but she didn’t feel like getting close to any human being. Judging by the reactions made by these human beings when they saw her and Tongtong, she felt that these people would take him away from her and claim that it would be better for the child.</p> <p>She felt uneasy, even though she believed that Lin Qiao wouldn’t let anyone hurt her and Tontong.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Junjun followed Lu Junjie to Lin Feng’s room. Lin Feng’s room was just seven or either meters away from theirs, the two rooms separated by a stair top.</p> <p>Before Lin Feng’s door and under Wei Jingchen’s curious gaze, Lin Qiao waited for Lu Junjie to knock on the door.</p> <p>Lu Junjie moved ahead and reported to Lin Feng, “That…Lu Tianyu and her friends are here.”</p> <p>At first, he didn’t know how to call Lin Qiao and her friends, but fortunately, he soon remembered Lin Feng mentioning the zombie’s name.</p> <p>“Let them in,” Lin Feng soon responded. Lu Junjie opened the door and then stood aside, signaling for Lin Qiao and Junjun to walk in.</p> <p>“Haha…you, where are your hair?” Once Lin Qiao walked in, Mrs. Lin burst in laughter as she pointed at Lin Qiao’s bald head and asked.</p> <p>The others in the room all stared at Lin Qiao’s bald head with surprise. Even Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing, who were both high-positioned leaders, didn’t manage to react timely.</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao didn’t know what to say. Behind her, Junjun covered her mouth and smiled in her head when she saw the looks on the faces of the roomful of people.</p> <p>As Junjun was standing pretty close behind Lin Qiao, Tongtong had been looking at her bald head the whole time. When Lin Qiao stopped walking, the boy couldn’t help but raise his little hands to touch her head from behind.</p> <p>When the boy touched her head from behind, Lin Qiao turned back to glance at him, then kept moving forward.</p> <p>At that point, Yuan Tian came back to his senses. He closed his gaped mouth and took in a deep breath, then showed a polite smile. After that, he stood up to point at the empty couch next to him and said, “Sit down, please.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over and sat down quite naturally. She didn’t realize that she was acting like all this was completely normal.</p> <p>Junjun carried Tongtong and followed Lin Qiao to the couch. But instead of sitting down, she stood behind it.</p> <p>Through observation, Lin Feng, Yuan Tianxing and the others had learned that Lin Qiao was the leader of the zombie group. She didn’t seem to be as powerful as the young female zombie, but she did have a strong vibe.</p> <p>She had a vibe of a high-positioned one. She was able to stay composed when facing anybody, without showing any fear.</p> <p>Sitting beside Lin Qiao, Yuan Tianxing showed a confused look. He felt that Lin Qiao’s vibe was familiar, as if he had sensed it before, and had been impressed by it.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao sat down, the others all changed their expressions. Only Lin Xiaolu continued staring at Lin Qiao’s head with curiosity. As the atmosphere in the room turned serious again due to these adults, she didn’t ask her grandma any question, only fixing her eyes on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After calming down, Lin Feng, Lin Wenwen, and Mrs. Lin all had the same feeling as Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p><em>‘Her vibe is so familiar! But, who is she?’</em></p> <p>Lin Feng frowned slightly and thought, <em>‘Who on earth is she? Her vibe is familiar to me, meaning that I’ve certainly met her before.’ </em>Lin Qiao’s vibe made him feel that his lost sister was right here, as if he was having an illusion.</p>",
  "Chapter 170: I Help Because I Want To": "<p>Lin Feng often followed around his sister, who was the chief, so he was rather familiar with her vibe. As clear-minded men, both he and Yuan Tianxing soon figured out that the zombie’s vibe was similar to Lin Qiao’s.</p> <p>Vibes couldn’t be copied…So, was this a coincidence?</p> <p>Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen hadn’t recognized Lin Qiao’s vibe yet. Lin Wenwen didn’t have sharp sensations, so she wasn’t as sensitive to vibes as Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing were. Mrs. Lin was just an ordinary human being who could barely sense things. She felt familiar only because the zombie had given her a very strong feeling.</p> <p>Long Qingying wasn’t a member of Lin Family, neither did she spend much time around Chief Netherworld Fire. So, she didn’t have any special feelings.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao suddenly moved her hand. In the next second, a white clipboard appeared in her hands.</p> <p>She found this clipboard among Qiu Lili’s belongings. Earlier on, she had gone to find a bra. But instead of a suitable bra, she saw the clipboard. As it could allow her to write more conveniently, she took it.</p> <p>And now, the clipboard just came in handy. Even though she was able to talk now, she couldn’t talk fast. Once she tried to speak faster, she wouldn’t be able to pronounce clearly anymore. Therefore, she decided to write for serious conversations.</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Qiao was ready, Yuan Tianxing glanced at Lin Feng and signaled for him to start the conversation. Lin Feng thought for a moment, then asked with curiosity, “Your name is Lu Tianyu, right? May I ask why you came to save us?”</p> <p>He wanted to know if someone had asked Lin Qiao to save him and his family.</p> <p>He and his people couldn’t trust any stranger. In the apocalyptic era, trust had become a luxury. Even the people who fought side by side with him had betrayed him, let alone the fact that he was now facing not a friend or a teammate, but a zombie. Days ago, they still believed that all zombies needed to be killed.</p> <p>He put himself in Lin Qiao’s shoes and figured that as a zombie, she didn’t have a reason to come all the way from the South to save a group of human beings. So, he just had to wonder about her real purpose.</p> <p>They had nothing to offer to these zombies except for their lives. So, why on earth were these strange zombies here? Were they really here to help?</p> <p>They had only known these zombies for two days, so they didn’t believe that. However, what all happened had proven that this group of zombies had indeed been helping them the whole time. They fought Yang Jianhua, and healed him and Yuan Tianxing. Therefore, even though he suspected the zombies of having other purposes, he didn’t share his thoughts with others.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing was prepared to go to the Sea City Base to find Li Zheng and his people in a couple of days, and also to try finding out something about Lu Tianyu. He thought that Sea City Base people might know something about her.</p> <p>However, little did Lin Feng know that Lin Qiao had sensed most of the thoughts of the roomful of people. She was no longer limited by her power level, so she even sensed some of Yuan Tianxing’s thoughts, as he was right beside her.</p> <p>She understood that these people wouldn’t trust her so easily. So, she pondered for a while, and felt that she shouldn’t try to make up an excuse. Instead, she should just…</p> <p>While thinking, she wrote on the clipboard with a charcoal pencil— <em>‘No reason. I just want to save you.’</em></p> <p>The others felt that that wasn’t even an answer.</p> <p>Reading this answer, the group of people felt that they shouldn’t ask further questions about why she had helped them. After all, a zombie could do whatever it wanted.</p> <p>Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing glanced at each other. This time, Yuan Tianxing said, “Mis-Miss. Lu, even though we don’t know why you helped us, we still want to thank you. Your water has great healing power, and it’s more effective than all our drugs.”</p> <p>While calling her ‘Miss. Lu’, Yuan Tianxing couldn’t help but glance at her bald head. Then, before losing control of his expression, he hurriedly smiled and began talking.</p> <p>However, how could Lin Qiao not detect his weird fake smile? After all, Yuan Tianxing used to be her Deputy Captain before the old world ended. She habitually rolled her eyes and then wrote— <em>‘You’re welcome.’</em></p> <p>At that point, Mrs. Lin, Lin Wenwen, and Lin Feng had fixed their eyes on Lin Qiao’s handwriting, and were lost in thoughts.</p> <p>The longer they looked at the handwriting, the more familiar they felt it was.</p> <p>Earlier on, Lin Feng had sensed that Lin Qiao’s vibe was similar to that of his sister who had blown herself up, and now, he had recognized Lin Qiao’s handwriting.</p> <p><em>‘Why is this zombie so much like Lin Qiao?’ </em>He wondered <em>, ‘Her vibe, even her handwriting?’</em></p> <p>The faces of Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen darkened a little when they saw Lin Qiao’s handwriting. Meanwhile, the confused look in their faces had become more and more obvious.</p> <p>Apart from Lin Family members, Yuan Tianxing had recognized her handwriting as well. However, he didn’t make any reaction to that.</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently sensed their thoughts, then glanced at her own handwriting. She had thought that they might recognize her handwriting before. She didn’t know what influence that might cause, but she didn’t care.</p> <p>They might continue doubting her, or slowly accept her, but she could only wait and see.</p> <p>Perhaps, there was a better way to protect them. But, she wanted something more than secretly protecting them while they knew nothing about her existence. She took the risk because she wanted to make direct contact with her family.</p> <p>Even though she had become a zombie, she still wanted to talk to her family and be with them.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing blinked, then continued, “We’ve decided to stay here. In the near future, we’ll start to build our new base. We’ll be waiting for the right time to take revenge against Yang Jianhua and Long Yubai.</p> <p>While saying the names of Yang Jianhua and Long Yubai, Yuan Tianxing was still smiling, and his tone hadn’t changed at all. However, he didn’t manage to conceal the murderous intent in his eyes.</p> <p>The others wore the same look as him, but their faces were much more twisted than his. However, all of them didn’t make a single sound.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed their mood swings, but had no feeling toward Long Yubai and Yang Jianhua. However, she remembered the dull pain that she had in her head when she heard the words ‘lifesaver’ before.</p> <p>She suddenly felt that she should make another trip to the South, to figure out the connection between her and the dead Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Did she lose her memories? Or, was there another person pretending to be her? The first guess was possible, but not the second.</p> <p>No matter how, she needed to figure the whole thing out. First of all, she had decided to start with her dead self.</p>",
  "Chapter 171: The Development of Human Beings": "<p>Yuan Tianxing said that they would wait for the right moment to take revenge, but Lin Qiao knew that the moment wouldn’t come so fast. They needed to settle down and then expand their team. They needed to wait until their strength broke into a higher level before taking their revenge. It might take them three to five years, or even eight to ten years; no one could tell for sure.</p> <p><em>‘So?’ </em>Lin Qiao nodded knowingly and then asked him with her eyes. Yuan Tianxing looked at her and responded seriously, “So, we want to work with you.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him and pointed at herself. Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “Yes, we want to work with you. Also, we want to ask you for help. You helped us yesterday. We don’t know why you did it, but we’ve felt your goodwill. I think you’ll agree to our request. What do you say?”</p> <p>He could tell that this zombie named Lu Tianyu was the leader of this small zombie group. He believed that as long as she agreed to cooperate, the other female zombies would be cool with it as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him, her eyes glowing slightly. Then, she wrote— <em>‘Work with us? What can you offer us then?’</em></p> <p>She was a high-level zombie now, while Qiu Lili was a zombie queen. Zombie queens and zombie kings were rather scarce in the post-apocalyptic era. Zombie queens and kings basically had nothing to be afraid of. Only level-seven superpowered human beings had any chance against zombie kings and queens, while all the others below level-seven were no match.</p> <p>The smile on Yuan Tianxing’s face changed slightly as he said, “We can offer you a shelter.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao looked at him with surprise, then turned back to make an eye-contact with Junjun. Clearly, neither of them understood Yuan Tianxing’s words.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing fixed his eyes on Lin Qiao’s bald head and pretty face, also noticing her bewildered look. For some reason, he felt that this zombie looked a little adorable with that confused look, and familiar.</p> <p>He gave a bigger smile and continued, “As you can see, human beings have been developing rapidly during the past few years, while you zombies have barely changed. You might think that we are weak now, but once we have built our new base and recruited some homeless survivors to offer them a home to live, our base will grow quickly. You zombies need to protect yourself from all the human bases. The success rate of zombie-hunting missions has been growing higher and higher. So, in one or two decades, how many zombies do you think will survive?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao frowned slightly. In fact, she had thought about this question long ago. The situation of zombies hadn’t changed much for now, but what would happen in one or two decades?</p> <p>Human beings were able to reproduce, while zombies weren’t. Over time, zombies would become less and less, as more and more of them were being killed.</p> <p>What about a century later? Would zombies be killed out by human beings who were getting stronger and stronger?</p> <p>The potential of human beings was unlimited, especially under chaotic circumstances. Soon, another era would begin, because the most difficult time had gone by, and human beings had built their bases successfully.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had lots of thoughts, but unlike her, Junjun had only realized the fact that human beings were growing stronger and stronger indeed, while zombies weren’t because they weren’t as smart as the other party.</p> <p>As the two zombies both wore serious looks, Yuan Tianxing knew that the chance to work with them was now bigger than before. He also discovered that the pretty bald female zombie was as smart as most in this roomful of human beings. From her expression, he could tell that she had been thinking far ahead.</p> <p>“Based on the current situation, we can easily predict the world in ten years. Since you still have your human memories, I believe you know how creative human beings can be, and how strong our desire for survival is. So, if you protect us now, we’ll protect you in the future. What do you think?” He continued.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him quietly, thinking that this man was rather calculative. Even if he didn’t ask, she would still protect them until they could no longer be threatened.</p> <p>She wanted very much to tell these people about who she really was. However, no normal human being would believe such an unscientific thing. If she tried telling her family the truth, Lin Feng and the others might think her as a bad one who was pretending to be Lin Qiao. If that happened, things would become troublesome.</p> <p>Even if she could find evidence to prove that she was Lin Qiao, her family might still not believe her. She knew about her family, and the fact that once they believed in something, nothing would be able to change their minds. So, she needed to find a way to make them accept her as a zombie first.</p> <p>Another reason that kept her from telling the truth was that she knew nothing about her other self, as if she had lost her memories for the past five years. In this case, how should she persuade them that she was Lin Qiao? That was the biggest problem—she truly had no way to prove her identity.</p> <p>Earlier on, she was trying to think of an excuse to stay around her family, but now, Yuan Tianxing had given her exactly one. Even though it sounded like he wanted to use her, Lin Qiao knew that this man would always keep his words. Perhaps, he wouldn’t abandon this small group of weird zombies in the future.</p> <p>No one in the room knew what Lin Qiao was thinking. As she stayed silent, they thought that she was pondering over Yuan Tanxing’s words, so they looked at her quietly.</p> <p>Looking at Lin Qiao, Lin Feng, Mrs. Lin, and Lin Wenwen all shared the same feeling.</p> <p>They wanted Lin Qiao to stay, not only because she had saved them before, also because she had been giving them a familiar feeling from time to time. Moreover, as Yuan Tianxing had said, maybe in a few decades, zombies would fall in a bad situation.</p> <p>After about ten seconds, Lin Qiao nodded under the gazes of the roomful of people and wrote— <em>‘You’re right. I can see that human beings are growing fast. But, please don’t underestimate zombies. Seeing me, you should know that some smart zombies do exist in the world.’</em></p> <p>She wanted to tell him that if more zombies like her who had human memories existed, and if they were holding different thoughts, the future of zombies would be unpredictable.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and Lin Feng both nodded on reading what she had written.</p> <p>“That’ll depend on if they’re hiding well enough.” Lin Feng said while staring at Lin Qiao’s handwriting without blinking.  <em>‘This zombie’s handwriting is so much similar to that of Lin Qiao’s! Every stroke! But, why can the zombie write like this?’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 172: Go to Another Place": "<p><em>‘But, if you plan to build a new base, I suggest you </em>to <em>find another place. This place isn’t ideal.’ </em>Lin Qiao continued writing.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing made eye-contact with Lin Feng and then asked, “Why?”</p> <p>This place was a remote county. Only a small number of zombies existed here, so it would only require a small effort to clean them out. This place wasn’t far away from the Sea City Base, so if anything happened, they could go to them for help.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wrote, <em>‘You are just a small group of people, and most of you are weak. It’ll be easy for the others to attack you if you’re staying here. So, in my opinion, you should find a zombie city. As we’re working together, we can build you a fence wall made of zombies.’</em></p> <p>Yuan Tianxing rested his chin on his palm and spent a moment thinking. He was nearly convinced by Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Zombie cities were the places with the largest numbers of zombies. Back in the old world, these places were busy large cities, and the people who lived there had high standards of living. The tall buildings in zombie cities were very suitable for living. People had great chances of finding untouched ice storage with lots of food in them, along with some intact supplies.</p> <p>Currently, the bases would send armies when they needed to enter zombie cities to collect supplies, because they had to deal with waves of zombie crowds and all sorts of high-level zombies among them.</p> <p>In a large zombie city, the number of level-five zombie leaders could be big, and even zombie kings and queens might exist.</p> <p>Hence, while normally entering zombie cities, level-seven base leaders would lead their armies themselves to guarantee relatively lower casualties and good harvests.</p> <p>Both Yuan Tianxing and Lin Feng had thought about all sorts of possibilities. But unlike them, Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen didn’t quite understand why Lin Qiao suggested them to leave this place and find another place to build their base.</p> <p><em>‘Go find a large city that no one has set foot in after the apocalypse. We’ll clean up the zombies. If any higher level zombie shows up, we’ll take it out. As for ordinary zombies, we’ll drive them to the outer circle. You’ll be able to find a nice place in that city to build your base’— </em>Lin Qiao wrote.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at Lin Feng to ask him about his opinion through his eyes. Lin Feng glanced at him, but stayed silent.</p> <p>Lin Qiao erased the lines she wrote, then continued writing, <em>‘In a zombie city, you can find the best-preserved supplies, and the environment is more habitable for human beings. As long as we’re with you, you don’ need to be afraid of the zombies.’</em></p> <p>The last sentence was the point. After reading that, Lin Feng slightly nodded to Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>“Okay, I agree with you…” Yuan Tianxing said, “as long as we can deal with the zombie crowds. We can also use the zombies to defend ourselves. We’ll spend a long time building our new base, so it’ll be nice if we can put the zombies to use.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded in agreement.</p> <p>As both Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing had agreed, Lin Qiao sighed in relief.<br/>\nAt that point, Mrs. Lin looked at Tongtong and asked, “May I ask what’s the story of this kid?”</p> <p>In the post-apocalyptic era, children were considered as the future of mankind, equally precious as women. Therefore, seeing Tongtong staying with two zombies, the roomful of human beings all couldn’t help but ask about him.</p> <p>As someone mentioned Tongtong, Junjun immediately showed a nervous look. She popped her pale gray eyes and held Tongtng tighter.</p> <p>“Hm…em…Ma… You’re hurting me…” As Junjun squeezed Tongtong unwittingly, the boy twisted his body and complained.</p> <p>Hearing that, she came back to her senses and realized that she was too nervous.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned around to look at Junjun, then shook her head to comfort the latter. After that, she turned back and wrote, <em>‘The boy is her son. When I found them, Junjun had just turned into a zombie, while Tongtong had been starving for days.’</em></p> <p>The clipboard wasn’t large enough, so Lin Qiao wrote a paragraph to show the group of people, then erased it and continued writing, <em>‘However, Junjun kept the boy from being eaten by other zombies. I saved Tongtong with my lake water. Don’t worry, she won’t hurt Tongtong, because he’s her child.’</em></p> <p>She didn’t tell the group of human beings that Junjun had lost her memories, and that she didn’t know for sure if Tongtong was really her son or not.</p> <p>The others glanced at each other and felt slightly relieved.</p> <p>“But, you’re zombies, and you don’t need to eat. So how do you…feed the child?” Lin Wenwen couldn’t help but ask.</p> <p><em>‘I found some vegetables and meat. We cook for him. Don’t worry, those foods won’t hurt human beings.’ </em>Lin Qiao wrote in response.</p> <p>The group of people looked at each other with surprise. Judging by Tongtong’s energetic look, the food he had been eating should be fine.</p> <p>“The child needs some carbohydrates to grow.” Mrs. Lin said kindly, “It sounds like you’ve never fed him with rice before. We have rice gruel here. Later on at meal time, we’ll send some to you, if you don’t mind.”</p> <p>As Mrs. Lin only offered to send some rice gruel but didn’t ask her to let Tongtong stay with her and her family, Junjun sighed with relief. The child did need some carbohydrates. Lin Qiao had been providing him with meat and vegetables, but staple food was also necessary, as lacking carbohydrates would cause a bad influence on a child’s development.</p> <p>Junjun slightly bent toward Mrs. Lin to show gratitude.</p> <p><em>‘Thank you!’ Lin Qiao wrote on the clipboard, ‘In return, come and find me when you need the lake water.’</em></p> <p>The group of people nodded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao roughly scheduled the meeting regarding the establishment of the new base which would take place tomorrow, then returned to her room with Junjun. But before leaving, she told Lin Feng, Yuan Tianxing, and the others to relax and rest; as long as she was there, no zombies at or under level-four would dare to come inside this building.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Back in the zombies’ room, Junjun put Tongtong on the bed. Qiu Lili hadn’t come back yet; she had probably gone somewhere to play.</p> <p>Abruptly, Junjun took over the clipboard from Lin Qiao’s hands and then wrote,<em>‘Why didn’t you tell them your real name? Isn’t your name Lin Qiao?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao’s zombie friends all knew that her name was Lin Qiao because she had told them so when she met them. They also knew why she had come to find Lin Feng and his people, as they were her family.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Junjun, then took over the clipboard and wrote, <em>‘Lu Tianyu is also a real name…It’s the name of this body.’</em></p> <p>Junjun looked at her confusedly. She didn’t know what Lin Qiao meant, neither did she know that the leader of the Hades Base was also named Lin Qiao. Perhaps, she used to know about that, but she couldn’t remember a thing now.</p> <p>Junjun had no idea that Lin Qiao was using Lu Tianyu’s body.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw her confused look, also sensing her thoughts. So, she wrote, <em>‘You don’t need to write. I can sense all your thoughts. This body isn’t my body, and this face isn’t my face.’</em></p> <p>Finishing writing, she touched her own face. Then somehow, her hand went to the top of her head.</p> <p>She felt a little speechless, as she had already touched her head more than five times today.</p>",
  "Chapter 173: Why Can You Talk": "<p>Reading Lin Qiao’s note, Junjun was still confused. At first, she couldn’t understand it, but a few seconds later, she suddenly raised her head while popping her pale gray eyes and staring at the former.</p> <p><em>‘What do you mean? Can you change your body and face? Well, maybe you can change your face, but the body?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao erased the handwriting on the clipboard, then continued writing, <em>‘Lu Tianyu was the original owner of this body. She was the mistress of a leader of the Sea </em>City Base <em>. But one day, that man got sick of her, so he threw her into a crowd of zombies.’</em></p> <p>Finishing writing, she raised the clipboard to show those words to Junjun, who wore an utterly bewildered look. Lin Qiao then took the clipboard back, erased the words, and continued writing, <em>‘When I woke up, I became what you had seen before.’</em></p> <p>Junjun didn’t know how to respond. She felt that her brain wasn’t working at all.</p> <p><em>‘Do you mean that you actually borrowed someone else’s body? No wonder your family sees you as a stranger. I thought your family will be able to recognize </em>you,<em>since your face has been fixed. I didn’t know that it’s not your face.’</em></p> <p>Suddenly, Junjun felt sorry for Lin Qiao, because she needed to pretend to be a stranger in front of her family.</p> <p>Sensing her thoughts, Lin Qiao smiled carelessly and wrote, <em>‘It’s alright, as long as I can be around them.’</em></p> <p>At that moment, she heard someone call her name from her space. Hearing that, she remembered that she had another zombie in her space.</p> <p><em>‘I want you to meet a friend’ </em>she wrote on the clipboard, and after showing it to Junjun, she flashed into her space under the latter’s curious gaze, showing up right beside Xie Dong.</p> <p>Xie Dong was now able to move freely. After Lin Qiao left, he sat on the chair by the lakeside and rested for a while. He discovered that the space had become much larger than before. The size of the lake and the grassland hadn’t changed, but the space was added with a strange patch of woods.</p> <p>He saw the small stove nearby, which had a pot on it. With curiosity, he stood up and began wandering in Lin Qiao’s space.</p> <p>He didn’t see Chief Wu’s daughter, but there were so many new things in the base. The small space which was accidentally gained from the space-powered man who used to be his teammate had moved a long distance away. On the grassland, those strawberry plants were thriving next to some vegetable plants.</p> <p>Besides the plants was a small-hill-sized pile of mutant pumpkins and potatoes.</p> <p><em>‘Why did she collect all these? Are these for eating?’ </em>He wondered. Xie Dong pictured Lin Qiao chewing pumpkins and potatoes and felt very uncomfortable.</p> <p>Apart from the vegetables, he also saw a lot of luxurious and exquisite furniture pieces, and found that the old bed was gone. He wondered where these furniture pieces came from.</p> <p>After taking a tour of Lin Qiao’s space, the look on his face became quite strange. At last, he finally roared at the misty sky.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n‘Lin Qiao!’</p> <p>In about ten seconds, Lin Qiao showed up.</p> <p>Seeing her bald head, Xie Dong was dumbfounded again. If he didn’t recognize her from those familiar dark eyes and her vibe, he might have jumped backward.</p> <p>He raised a hand to point at Lin Qiao’s head. He wanted to laugh, but didn’t know if he should.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rolled her eyes and said, “Laugh…if…you…want…”</p> <p>Hearing those words, Xie Dong, who had been trying to keep himself from laughing out, gave a big grin. He didn’t utter any laughter, but the grin on his face was obvious.</p> <p>Lin Qiao dragged his arm and exited the space. In the next moment, the two of them showed up in the room.</p> <p>Once out, Xie Dong automatically fixed his eyes on Junjun and Tongtong. After figuring out that they were a level-one female zombie and a human kid, he sighed in relief.</p> <p>Junjun had been preparing herself, yet when Xie Dong showed up suddenly, she was still startled. She involuntarily held Tongtong in her arms, as if that was the only way she could feel safe.</p> <p>Then, she carefully sensed Xie Dong’s vibe and discovered that he wasn’t a human being, but a zombie just like Lin Qiao and herself.</p> <p><em>‘But his face…’ </em>she wondered. Xie Dong’s eyes looked no different from those of human beings. His face was clean, without large black circles under his eyes. He looked just like a healthy human being, and nothing like a zombie.</p> <p>However, judging by his vibe, he was a zombie indeed, and that too at a higher level than Junjun herself.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised a hand toward Junjun, then spoke to Xie Dong, “Junjun…”After that, she pointed at Tongtong and introduced him, “Tongtong…”</p> <p>Seeing the strange zombie, Tongtong leaned his head toward Junjun timidly, putting his arms around her neck while looking at Xie Dong curiously.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then pointed at Xie Dong and introduced him to Junjun, “Xie…Dong…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s voice was dry and hoarse, but she pronounced the words clearly. Xie Dong understood what she said, but felt that she talked way too slow.</p> <p>However, talking slowly was better than being unable to talk anyway.</p> <p><em>‘Why can she talk though?’ </em>Xie Dong thought, <em>‘Where are the scars on her face? And, why is she bald? Well, she might have shaved her head because her hair looked like straws.’</em></p> <p>Then, he turned to look at Junjun and Tongtong. The female zombie was at a lower level than him, so she wasn’t dangerous in his eyes. Her behavior was a little weird though, as she was carrying a human kid.</p> <p>However, Xie Dong didn’t care about why Junjun was holding the kid the whole time. What he cared about were the changes that had happened to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Whooo… aw?”<br/>\n‘Why can you talk?’ Xie Dong growled at Lin Qiao to ask. Hearing his question, Junjun raised her head to look at Lin Qiao as well. She had guessed that Lin Qiao’s recovery had something to do with the lake in her space, but didn’t know how exactly did that happen.</p> <p>She was very curious about how Lin Qiao was healed and suddenly able to talk. Lin Qiao thought for a moment, then wrote, <em>‘I was healed in the lake, by the energy from the lake.’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong looked at her yearningly. Lin Qiao knew that he wanted to be able to talk too. However, she hadn’t tried helping other zombies to heal in the lake. She figured that she needed to talk to that weird vine plant in the lake before letting her zombie friends down in the lake. Otherwise, they might end up like that level-four wind-powered zombie.</p> <p>Without negotiating with the vine plant, the lake might not fix Xie Dong’s voice; even worse, it might drain his zombie nucleus. If that happened, he would lose more than he could gain.</p> <p>She dropped her eyes and wrote on the clipboard, <em>‘There’s a creature in my lake. You’ll need its permission if you want to be healed, or…’</em></p> <p>While writing, she glanced at Junjun. The latter had been staying in her space for most of the time, so without a doubt, she knew about that vine plant.</p> <p>As she expected, Junjun flinched slightly, looking at Lin Qiao dreadfully and helplessly.</p> <p>Xie Dong hadn’t noticed what was down in the lake. Before he turned into a zombie, he had darted into the lake unconsciously. Back at that time, it was the vine plant which had absorbed his energy and thrown him up to the water surface.</p>",
  "Chapter 174: Handwriting And Vibe": "<p>Back then, Xie Dong had nothing inside his body except the energy provided by the zombie virus. Therefore, his body absorbed the energy of the lake water after being drained, and he woke up soon after.</p> <p>If the vine plant hadn’t removed the zombie virus from his body, and if the lake water hadn’t changed his body condition, he surely wouldn’t have become what he had—a zombie who looked like a human being.</p> <p>Except for that bad-tempered vine plant, nobody knew about that; neither Lin Qiao, nor Xie Dong himself. Xie Dong didn’t even remember how he became a zombie.</p> <p>Junjun opened her mouth toward Lin Qiao, yet didn’t utter any sound. However, Lin Qiao had already heard what she wanted to say. So, she wrote on the clipboard, <em>‘I need to talk to it about that. But, to restore your bodies and voices, it will require energy. We can use energy nuclei of human beings, zombie nuclei, or those of mutant plants.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao wasn’t sure if the lake could heal other zombies. With that thought, she continued writing, <em>‘I need to ask it if it can fix your voices.’</em></p> <p>Then, she turned and flashed into her space.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Feng and the others had started talking about Lin Qiao’s handwriting after she had left. “Yesterday when she wrote on the paper, I already felt that her handwriting was familiar,” said Mrs. Lin. “Now, I think her handwriting is exactly the same as Qiao’s.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded and said, “Not everyone can write with sharp and bold strokes like my sister. Even if that zombie was imitating, her handwriting should not be exactly the same as my sister’s. But, I’ve been watching her the whole time just now. She wrote pretty casually, yet her handwriting was just the same as my sister’s.”</p> <p>Lin Feng pondered for a short while, then joined the conversation, “Her vibe, her sitting posture, and her little habits are all similar to Lin Qiao’s. And earlier on when I focused on her face, I found that her expressions were familiar as well. All in all, her behavior, looks, the way she talks and thinks, are all quite alike to those of Lin Qiao. What do you think, Tianxing?”</p> <p>While finishing talking, he turned to look at Yuan Tianxing, who was wearing a bland look. The latter had a faint smile on his face, but his blinking eyes had told everyone else that he was considering something.</p> <p>He had noticed all that was mentioned by Lin Feng and the others. He was secretly in love with Lin Qiao for years, so he surely knew almost everything about her, not to mention the fact that he was around her all these years.</p> <p>However, the zombie named Lu Tianyu was so strange that he couldn’t tell a thing about her.</p> <p>As a zombie, she came all the way to save Lin Feng and his people. Perhaps, she did that to serve a particular purpose. But, what purpose could a zombie possibly have? Did she want to eat their flesh? Their heart? Or their energy nuclei?</p> <p>If she wanted to eat them, why would she pretend to be a good one and save them?</p> <p>Besides, she looked like a male yesterday. But after one single night, she turned into a female, and her appearance had changed thoroughly! That was so confusing!</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Qiao entered her space, leaving Junjun and Xie Dong in the room with the little boy. Junjun stared at Xie Dong a nervously. She had sensed something not quite good from him, something a little like the thirst for blood, and also ferocity.</p> <p>However, it wasn’t the kind of ferocity that a zombie could have after it had killed many human beings, but like…</p> <p>Junjun couldn’t explain her feeling, but Xie Dong did make her feel danger.</p> <p>Both Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili had made her feel the kind of pressure from higher level beings, but unlike them, Xie Dong was a predator in her eyes.</p> <p>Xie Dong knew that Junjun was nervous because of him, so he had tried his best to restrain his vibe. But, she was still afraid, and he didn’t know what to do to help her.</p> <p>He looked around, then sniffed at the air. After that, he walked to the door and sniffed through it.</p> <p>He had sensed human beings outside, a dozen of them.</p> <p>He was curious about who these people were, and why Lin Qiao and Junjun were with them. Were these people the ones that Lin Qiao had been looking for? Did they know that the ones staying in this room were all zombies? And, where did Lin Qiao find Junjun and the little boy?</p> <p>Before, Lin Qiao would only act alone. But now, she was with another female zombie and a little boy.</p> <p>Xie Dong also wondered where Wu Yueling had gone. Had Lin Qiao sent her back? Didn’t she go to the South? Did she head back to send the little girl to her father? Or, did Chief Wu catch her?</p> <p>Nothing made sense to him. If those human beings out there weren’t the ones that Lin Qiao was looking for, who were they?</p> <p>With lots of puzzles in his head, Xie Dong turned back to look at Junjun and Tongtong with confusion.</p> <p>Why did fate always bring kids to Lin Qiao?</p> <p>…</p> <p>After entering the space, Lin Qiao glanced around, still not used to the changes that had happened to her space. It had become a lot bigger than before, but somehow, she felt that she wasn’t able to control it.</p> <p>Was she the owner of this place? Or, was she just an outsider who happened to borrow it? Was the vine plant in the lake the real owner of this space?</p> <p>With that thought, she walked to the lakeside to observe the water surface. In fact, she was trying to sense the vine plant in the lake, wondering if it would help her to heal her zombie friends.</p> <p>A few vines slowly showed up, as if the plant had sensed her presence, sticking out of the water while wriggling. Lin Qiao looked at them with surprise, then raised a hand to wave at them.</p> <p>But then, she began struggling, because she didn’t know how to communicate with these vines. She was able to communicate with human beings and zombies, yet she had never tried to talk to plants.</p> <p>She felt that this vine plant was rather smart, as it had thrown the large turtle back out a couple of times.</p> <p>Where was this vine plant from? Could mutant plants become conscious after the apocalypse?</p> <p>Last time, Lin Qiao had felt that the vine plant was like a wilful child as it slapped the water in protest. Recalling that, Lin Qiao even wanted to laugh. Moreover, when the vine plant asked her for the kernel, it was also like a child who was begging for candy.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao waved, a long vine reached out of the water toward her.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? So obedient!’ </em>Watching the vine send itself to her, Lin Qiao was quite surprised.  <em>‘How should I tell it that I want it to heal my friends too?’ </em>She took it as healing, but in fact, she felt that it was more like upgrading. After all, every time she was healed a little, she became stronger than before.</p> <p><em>‘Should I write? Can this vine read? Should I talk? Maybe. But I don’t know if it can understand my language either!’ </em></p> <p>But then, Lin Qiao thought that the vine plant might prefer telepathy as a way of communication, because she had suddenly recalled that for the last two times, the vine coiled around her wrist or ankle to send messages to her brain.</p> <p>It seemed that in order to communicate with it, she needed to make direct physical contact with it.</p>",
  "Chapter 175: Call Me Viney": "<p>Lin Qiao raised a finger, and as she expected, the vine slowly reached the lakeside as it crawled toward her. Seeing this, she squatted and reached her fingers toward it, which instantly coiled around one of her fingers, as if it knew what she wanted.</p> <p><em>‘Mama…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Eh? Who?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Mama…’</em></p> <p>‘ <em>Damn! Who’s calling me Mama! You weird vine, don’t call me Mama!’ </em>Lin Qiao yelled in her head. She couldn’t help but stare at the vine which was coiled around her finger in shock, startled on hearing someone call her ‘Mama’ in her head.</p> <p><em>‘Whooo… You’re Mama… You’re Mama!’</em></p> <p>Then, another message was sent into her head. The vine plant believed that Lin Qiao was its mama! At this point, she even wanted to cry. <em>‘Even if I skipped five years and became a zombie, I can’t possibly give birth to a baby vine!’</em></p> <p><em>‘You didn’t give birth to me… You planted me…’</em></p> <p>Sensing Lin Qiao’s thought, the vine plant sent a new message to her head to correct her. Lin Qiao wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. At last, she thought helplessly, <em>‘Who planted you here in this space? I didn’t plant you.’</em></p> <p><em>‘Whoo… Mama… It’s you, Mama…’</em></p> <p>The vine plant sounded like a peevish child. It was worried that Lin Qiao might not admit that it was her child, so it wouldn’t stop crying in her head.</p> <p><em>‘Mama…You’re my Mama…You’re my Mama…You are my Mama…Mama… Mama…Mama…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to cry but failed to shed any tears.</p> <p><em>‘Mama… Mama… Mama…’ </em>The vine plant repeated it again and again, and Lin Qiao was soon defeated. She gave up as she closed her eyes and faced a palm toward the vine.</p> <p><em>‘Alright! Alright! I get it! I’m your Mama! Stop screaming! Quiet!’</em></p> <p>She always felt helpless when she was with children, and the vine was like a stubborn child. Right now, Lin Qiao really needed to talk to it about something else, so she decided to put aside the whole ‘Mama’ thing for now. Later on when she got time, she would come in and ask it for more details.</p> <p>Fortunately, the vine was quite obedient. As Lin Qiao told it to quiet down, it quieted down immediately, but didn’t stop poking her palm as if it was having fun.</p> <p>Looking at the leafless vine, Lin Qiao thought about how to convince it to heal her zombie friends. Meanwhile, she asked the vine about its name. Since it was intelligent, it should have a name.</p> <p><em>‘Do you have a name?’</em></p> <p>Hearing that question, the vine paused for two seconds, then continued poking her.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, call me Viney…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Viney? Vine? So, you do have a name. But, that sounds like a nickname.’</em></p> <p><em>‘Of course, I have a name…’ </em>Sensing that Lin Qiao was surprised, Viney got little unhappy. Lin Qiao couldn’t help but poke the vine with her other hand. She found that it was a little soft, and not as slippery as she had imagined.</p> <p>It was soft and elastic, unlike how she felt down in the lake.</p> <p>It was time for the serious talk, so she questioned in her head while poking it,<em>‘Can you please heal my zombie friends too? Like what you did to me? Can you fix their faces and enable them to talk?’</em></p> <p>Hearing that, Viney soon responded, <em>‘Sure, sure, sure, little Viney can do whatever Mama wants me to do…! But, little Viney doesn’t have enough energy…So </em>Mama <em>, you need to find me more sources of energy.’</em></p> <p>Hearing Viney agreeing to help, Lin Qiao was delighted. She didn’t expect it to be so willing to help. She knew that by sources of energy, Viney meant the nuclei of zombies, human beings, and mutant plants.</p> <p>She nodded and responded, <em>‘Okay, I can provide you with the nuclei of zombies or other creatures.’</em></p> <p>Viney wriggled like a snake while sending a message into Lin Qiao’s head, <em>‘Em… It’ll be better if you can find the nuclei of my kind…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t quite understand, so she asked, <em>‘Your kind? Like plants? Or just vines?’</em></p> <p>Viney replied, <em>‘Eh? What’re plants? I want the ones like what you gave me the last time…to help me upgrade…’</em></p> <p>As Viney mentioned ‘upgrade’, Lin Qiao remembered the kernel of the vine plant from the outside. She didn’t know which level that vine plant was at, but its kernel had enlarged the space by quite a lot.</p> <p><em>‘Which part of you has upgraded?’ </em>She asked.</p> <p>Sensing the puzzlement in Lin Qiao’s head, Viney waved its vine, as if showing off. ‘Em, I have upgraded, I have upgraded! Little Viney’s energy nucleus is growing bigger.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the vine bewilderedly. <em> ‘Alright, it’s normal for you to have an energy nucleus. But, I really can’t tell that you’ve upgraded,’ </em>she thought.</p> <p><em>‘When I grow up, I’ll look different! And I’ll be able to move!’ </em>Viney sent another message into Lin Qiao’s head, making her look at it with surprise. Thinking of being able to move, Viney happily waved the vine.</p> <p>As Viney had agreed to help, Lin Qiao nodded and prepared to get out.<br/>\n‘Alright, you go back into the lake. I still have some other things to do. When you’re able to move, I’ll take you out to play,’ she said to Viney in her head while standing up. Once she moved, the vine fell off her finger and drew back slightly, pausing for a short while and then going back into the water, seeming a bit reluctant.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up and turned, then abruptly saw the few large turtles lying on the other side of the grassland.  <em>‘Ah, I still have to find a way to store these food sources! I can’t put them in the water, and can’t let them run about in the space either. Shall I build a large iron cage for them?’</em></p> <p>Thinking of iron cage, she thought of Long Qingying as well. The latter had the metal power, so she wondered if she could make a large metal cage for these turtles.</p> <p>With this idea, she turned and exited her space.</p> <p>Once out, she saw Junjun and Xie Dong quietly sitting in the room. Junjun was sitting on the bed by the door with Tongtong in her arms, while Xie Dong was sitting on the single couch near the window. He wasn’t looking at Junjun, just facing the window.</p> <p>Junjun had been looking at him the whole time, and Tontong had fallen in sleep in her arms.</p> <p>Once Lin Qiao showed up, both Junjun and Xie Dong turned toward her. Xie Dong looked at her expectantly while Junjun sighed in relief and finally relaxed her vigilance.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to look at Junjun and found that she seemed to dislike Xie Dong in particular. Then, she turned toward the other.</p> <p>Xie Dong looked the same as before, covered in wounds, wearing ragged clothes, and seeming quite miserable. However, the look on his face and his vibe were no longer the same as before when he had just become a zombie.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t carefully sense his vibe before, but after some observation now, she found something strange.</p> <p>“Do…you…eat…humans?” She asked expressionlessly.</p>",
  "Chapter 176: From Now On, You Follow Me": "<p>Lin Qiao had only said three words slowly, but the other two zombies in the room had both figured out the whole sentence.</p> <p>She was asking Xie Dong about how many human beings he had eaten.</p> <p>Hearing her question, Junjun automatically turned to shield Tongtong from Xie Dong with her own body. The latter’s eyes darkened a little when he heard the question, but he didn’t respond.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sniffed at him, then glanced at him blandly and continued, “You…can…eat…humans…But…don’t…get…addicted…”</p> <p>She wasn’t against man-eating. If Xie Dong only ate bad people, she would be okay with it. However, getting addicted to man-eating was unacceptable.</p> <p>Xie Dong nodded at her in response.</p> <p>“Choose…the…targets…” Lin Qiao continued. She wanted to tell him that he needed to know how to choose his targets. He could eat the bad ones like the post-apocalyptic robbers, but not the good ones.</p> <p>She didn’t want him to be addicted to man-eating, then slowly lose his humanity and become a cold-blooded zombie with human memories.</p> <p>“Roar…em…” Xie Dong gave her a gentle roar.</p> <p><em>‘Don’t worry. I don’t eat humans unless I have to. I understand,’ </em>he said. He wanted Lin Qiao to know that he wouldn’t eat human beings unless he was left with no other choice, and that he knew how badly man-eating could affect him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and didn’t continue this topic, but glanced at Junjun and said, “From…now…you…follow…me…”</p> <p>Xie Dong understood that Lin Qiao wanted him to follow her instead of getting close to the female zombie who was carrying a child, in case he lost control and hurt the little boy.</p> <p><em>‘But without you, can she protect the child on her own?’ </em>He wondered. He looked at Junjun with confusion, then turned toward Lin Qiao, who sensed his thoughts and then abruptly pointed outside the window.</p> <p>Xie Dong turned to that direction confusedly, then saw a white figure quietly standing on the roof of another building, staring at him with a pair of red eyes.</p> <p>He was startled at the sight of those eyes, and his fine hair all stood straight up.</p> <p>The white figure was only about two-hundred-meters away from him, yet he hadn’t sensed it at all. Only after Lin Qiao pointed at it did he discover that it had been watching him.</p> <p>Once he saw the white figure, he somehow felt oppressed.</p> <p>Before he figured out who it was, the white figure disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>Xie Dong turned to Lin Qiao with a questioning look in his eyes. She didn’t tell him the story of Qiu Lili, but turned to walk toward the door and signaled to tell him that she needed to leave now. As she didn’t answer his question, Xie Dong glanced back at where the white figure had disappeared, then followed her to the door. Then, Lin Qiao opened the door and they walked out.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked toward Lin Feng’s room with Xie Dong. She asked someone about where Long Qingying was, then walked to another door and knocked on it.</p> <p>Wei Jingchen, who guarded by Lin Feng’s door, turned to look at Lin Qiao and the strange man beside her. Xie Dong looked like a human being, so Wei Jingchen thought that it was a man following behind Lin Qiao. He only gave Xie Dong a quick glance before turning his eyes away.</p> <p>The door was soon answered.</p> <p>It was Lin Wenwen who opened the door. Seeing Lin Qiao, she asked with surprise, “Eh? Lu Tianyu? How can I help you?”</p> <p>When she called Lin Qiao Lu Tianyu, Xie Dong gave a start at first, then stared at Lin Qiao’s bald head from behind in shock.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was at a close distance from him, so she quickly sensed his feelings. However, she didn’t turn back, pretending like nothing had happened while asking Lin Wenwen, “Find…Long…”</p> <p>She was using Lu Tianyu’s body, so it was normal for Xie Dong to react a little on hearing that name. After all, he and Lu Tianyu were both from the Sea City Base. Lu Tianyu might not know Xie Dong, but everyone in the Sea City Base had heard her name.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was now bald, with black eyes and without any makeup. As she looked nothing like the original Lu Tianyu, it was reasonable for him to be unable to recognize her.</p> <p>Hearing someone call Lin Qiao Lu Tianyu, Xie Dong was astounded at first, then started to have all sorts of puzzles in his head.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen heard the two words from Lin Qiao. The zombie’s voice was a little unpleasant, but still, she figured out her meaning. She gazed at the latter with surprise, as it was the first time for her to hear a zombie talk! It was so interesting!</p> <p>While looking at Lin Qiao curiously, she yelled, “Qingying, Lu Tianyu wants to talk to you!” Then, she opened the door entirely while giving Xie Dong a glance, and asked Lin Qiao, “You can really talk! Don’t zombies all have broken throats and stiff tongues? I heard that when zombies eat, they’ll bite the flesh off with their teeth and then swallow it directly, so they don’t even need tongues!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked into the room after Lin Wenwen had opened the door. Xie Dong didn’t follow her, but stood by the door and watched her.</p> <p>He knew that he couldn’t enter girls’ room without their permission; that was a basic manners.</p> <p>Just now, on hearing Lin Wenwen call Lin Qiao Lu Tianyu, Xie Dong was utterly stunned. ‘Isn’t her name Lin Qiao? Why Lu Tianyu now? Does she have the same name as the woman in our base? Or…is she Lu Tianyu? But that’s impossible, because they look nothing alike!’</p> <p><em>‘That woman always wore thick </em>makeup, <em>and cared so much about her hair and dressing style. How could she possibly end up like this? Bald? She would never wear these clothes…And…has she become a zombie?’</em></p> <p>However, when he pictured Lin Qiao’s face together with Lu Tianyu’s, he suddenly felt that they were similar indeed. Their eyes, noses, and mouths were almost the same. But still, those two faces looked way too different, so he couldn’t tell for sure.</p> <p><em>‘If she’s Lu Tianyu, why did she tell me that her name was Lin Qiao?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Lin Qiao…Lin Qiao…This name is a little familiar…’ </em>He felt that he had heard this name before. <em>‘And, if she’s Lu Tianyu, how did she become a zombie? How did she die before turning into a zombie? Would Chief Yang ever let her die?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Yang Chao let her do anything she wanted in the base. He really liked her, so how could he let her die?’</em></p> <p>‘I remember how she looked like when I saw her the first time. She was in a much worse shape than now. Her face was covered with scars, and maybe her body was too, though I couldn’t possibly see it as she was wearing clothes.’</p> <p><em>‘And, how could her personality change so suddenly after she turned into a zombie? She has many combat skills which are from the special forces, but Lu Tianyu was never a soldier.’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 177: Make A Large Cage": "<p>With all kinds of questions in his head, Xie Dong was overwhelmed a little. He moved to the door side and waited for Lin Qiao to come out while thinking.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen glanced at Xie Dong curiously when Lin Qiao walked in, then closed the door.</p> <p>Lin Qiao responded to Lin Wenwen with a faint, mysterious smile, and looked at Long Qingying, who was walking toward her from the window side. Then, she took out the clipboard and wrote something down.</p> <p><em>‘I want you to make me a large metal cage.’</em></p> <p>“Metal cage? What do you need that for? Do you need to lock something up?” Lin Wenwen stared at Lin Qiao’s handwriting for a couple of seconds, then asked.</p> <p>“Large metal cage?” Long Qingying also looked at Lin Qiao and asked with confusion, “What kind of metal cage do you want? How large?”</p> <p><em>‘Oblong, two meters tall, five meters long, three meters wide, without a bottom’ </em>—Lin Xiao wrote.</p> <p>Long Qingying glanced at Lin Wenwen, then continued asking, “This large? To keep what?”</p> <p>“Without a bottom? So, it’ll be like a large metal cover, right?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao erased the words on the clipboard and then continued writing— <em>‘Large turtles.’</em></p> <p>Reading that, Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying were even more confused. What kind of turtle needed to be kept in such a large cage? How big were those turtles? Why did the zombie catch those turtles? And, why did she want to keep them in cages?</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t answer all of their questions, but threw back one of her own—<em>‘Can you help?’</em></p> <p>Long Qingying nodded expressionlessly and responded, “No problem! But, the cage you want is too big, so I need to go out of the building to make it for you.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then smiled at Long Qingying and Lin Wenwen. Having decided on it, Long Qingying walked toward the door right away. Lin Qiao followed behind her, and Lin Wenwen followed behind the former with curiosity.</p> <p>Once out, Long Qingying saw Xie Dong, who was standing by the wall. She glanced at him without showing any interest, then kept moving toward the stairs.</p> <p>Soon, she exited the lobby and came to the parking lot outside the hotel gate. Xie Dong followed Lin Qiao down. Ever since she came out of Lin Wenwen’s room, he had been staring at her.</p> <p>The more he looked at her, the more she seemed like Lu Tianyu. <em> ‘Is she really Lu Tianyu?’ </em>He wondered.</p> <p>Sensing his gaze, Lin Qiao glanced back at him.  <em>‘What’s wrong?’ </em>She asked.</p> <p>Xie Dong raised a hand to point at her and opened his mouth. He wanted to utter a sound to ask her if she was Lu Tianyu, but then he glanced at the two humans and gave up.</p> <p>On the other side, Long Qingying looked at the surrounding buildings. She chose a relatively more damaged area, then raised a hand to reach to a certain direction.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw that a stream of energy gushed out of her head, circled in her body, and then gathered in her palm. Next, as she crooked her fingers toward the halfway broken building, all metal pieces in there flew at her.</p> <p>Those pieces melted into a giant and dark metal chunk, floating above the parking lot.</p> <p>She reached out another hand toward the metal chunk, her fingers clenched. Then, she started to pull her hands away from each other. Following her movements, the metal chunk was elongated as if a pair of giant invisible hands had been stretching it.</p> <p>As she waved her arms in the air like drawing a picture, the metal chunk slowly changed its shape and became an oblong cage. The cage was made from broomstick-thick metal sticks, about fifteen centimeters apart from each other.</p> <p>Long Qingying turned to ask Lin Qiao, “Is the space okay?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded in response. Not even the smallest one among the few turtles Lin Qiao had caught could escape this cage. <em> ‘Maybe after I have finished the few turtles, I can go back to the lake and catch some more!’ </em>She thought.</p> <p>As she nodded, Long Qingying put the huge cage on the ground. Lin Qiao walked over and gripped two metal sticks to pull them. She found that the cage was rather sturdy, so she turned to nod at Long Qingying again.</p> <p>Long Qingying crossed her arms before her chest, standing aside as she looked at Lin Qiao curiously. Lin Wenwen watched for a while and couldn’t help but ask Lin Qiao, “What exactly do you need this giant cage for?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao closed her eyes to sense her space, then swung her arm toward the ground. With that, a large turtle fell to the ground.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>“Wow! Such a huge turtle shell! Do you like to collect turtle shells? Strange taste!” Lin Wenwen stared at the turtle and remarked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the turtle and turned it around. Then, she squatted by the turtle and raised a hand. Suddenly, a tiny mouse appeared in her hand, its tail pinched between her fingers.</p> <p>Since she woke up in this post-apocalyptic world, about twenty days had passed. This mouse had spent over ten days in her space. It hadn’t grown up yet, but it was a lot bigger than before.</p> <p>Being dangled from Lin Qiao’s hand, the mouse struggled as hard as it could. It bent its body to try and climb up through its own tail, but as she shook her hand, it fell again.</p> <p>Squeak! Squeak!</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook the mouse for a few times and made it fall unconscious. Then, she put it before the turtle’s head and swung it slightly.</p> <p>The others watched Lin Qiao with curiosity, wondering what she was doing. They thought it was just a turtle shell, but judging by Lin Qiao’s movement, there seemed to be something in it.</p> <p>Right at that moment, a turtle head thrust out of the shell and bared its sharp teeth to bite the mouse.</p> <p>Squeak!</p> <p>The mouse sensed the danger, immediately waking up and struggling.<br/>\nFortunately for it, Lin Qiao pulled the mouse up before the turtle could bite it.</p> <p>“Eh? It’s alive!” Lin Wenwen stared at the turtle and said with surprise.</p> <p>After missing its target, the turtle quickly reached out its limbs and turned, trying to run away. However, as Lin Qiao put a foot on its shell, the turtle could only move its limbs without being able to move an inch.</p> <p>By now, the others truly believed that the large cage was for keeping turtles. But, they still felt that the cage was a little too large for just one turtle.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the others in the eyes and figured out what they were thinking. Without paying much attention to their thoughts, she nimbly kicked the turtle to turn it around, making it lie on the ground.</p> <p>After that, she pushed the turtle toward the cage with her foot. As the turtle was sent to the cage, she lifted one corner with one hand, then kicked the turtle in.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Having done that, she put the cage back down.</p> <p>The turtle rolled into the cage, getting back on all fours as it stopped rolling and trying to run immediately. However, it wasn’t able to run out of the cage. Its hard shell hit against the metal cage and caused loud noises. The cage was shaken slightly, but showed no sign of breaking.</p>",
  "Chapter 178: Ask if You Want": "<p>Seeing the turtle run swiftly in the cage, the others all came closer with surprise.</p> <p>Was that really a turtle? Why was it even faster than a rabbit?</p> <p>Lin Qiao reached a hand into the cage and swung it quickly.</p> <p>Thud, thud, thud!</p> <p>The other turtles were all brought out of her space and thrown into the cage. In the next instant, the group of turtles began running about in the cage.</p> <p>Cling-clang, cling-clang… The loud noises echoed across the entire parking lot. The group of people had all picked the rooms facing the parking lot. Therefore, they heard the noise and looked down through the windows.</p> <p>“Eh? What are they doing down there?”</p> <p>“Such a large cage. What are those creatures in the cage? They’re so big, looking a little like…turtles?”</p> <p>“Turtles? Have you ever seen the turtles that can run so fast?”</p> <p>“Em… They’re really turtles! But, I guess they’re mutant. Why did Lu Tianyu cage those turtles?”</p> <p>“Who knows? She’s weird!”</p> <p>By the parking lot, Long Qingying couldn’t help but ask, “Did you go to catch these turtles last night? Are you gonna eat them?” She knew that Lin Qiao liked to eat mutant animals. So, when she saw these turtles, she guessed that they might be her food.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put on the sunglasses and smilingly nodded at her.</p> <p>“So, you eat these. No wonder you don’t eat human beings,” said Lin Wenwen. “But, these turtles are mutant. I think they all carry the virus. You’re a zombie, so you won’t be infected, but if you put these turtles here, will they escape from the cage and bite us?”</p> <p><em>‘That would depend on whether the cage is strong enough,’ </em>Lin Qiao thought as she turned to Long Qingying. The latter responded, “They can’t get out unless someone lets them out.”</p> <p>The cage was heavy. A few large turtles tried biting the metal sticks with their sharp teeth, but only left some white marks on the cage.</p> <p>“Em,” Lin Wenwen glanced at Long Qingying and nodded. Then, Lin Qiao said to both of them, “You…can…eat…”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying glanced at each other, then turned toward her bewilderedly. “Do you mean we can eat these turtles? But, they’re mutant, carrying the virus. If we eat them, we’ll become like you, won’t we?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said slowly, “You…won’t…There’s…a…way…”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying looked at her with confusion. “You haven’t been feeding the child with mutant animals, have you?” Lin Wenwen asked skeptically.</p> <p>Before, Lin Wenwen had wondered how the few zombies managed to take good care of a human child. Just now, she and Mr. Lin were talking about what the zombies had been feeding the child with.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at her. Lin Wenwen widened her eyes as she asked, “Aren’t you afraid that the child might become a zombie?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao waved a hand and replied, “He…won’t…”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen looked at her with puzzlement in her head. She felt that it was a miracle for the boy to have survived until present. However, if Lin Qiao could tell what was edible for human beings and what wasn’t, it would be highly helpful.</p> <p>“How long has the boy been with you?” She asked. Lin Qiao showed her seven fingers in response.</p> <p>“Seven? Seven months? Or days?”</p> <p>“Days…” Lin Qiao said slowly.</p> <p>“Okay,” Lin Wenwen nodded.</p> <p>As the cage was forged and the turtles were caged, Lin Qiao turned to walk back to the hotel. The others followed her while Lin Wenwen couldn’t stop asking all sorts of question.</p> <p>“You haven’t told us how you think we should eat those turtles. And…how do zombies excrete wastes? Ah, the others zombies all eat human beings, but why do you eat animals?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little speechless. She talked very slowly, so without any other choice, she listened to Lin Wenwen’s endless questions silently. Fortunately, she was used to this. She decided to skip some of the questions, as the latter would always try figuring out the answers while asking the questions.</p> <p>Long Qingying seemed to be used to that as well, as she followed the others upstairs expressionlessly.</p> <p>“If…you…want…to…eat…use…my…water…” When they came to the fourth floor, Lin Qiao finally said to Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen interrupted her and said, “Ah, do you mean we should boil the turtle with the water you provided? Can the water remove the virus? Really?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t mind being interrupted, and nodded at her in affirmation.</p> <p>“Okay, I get it!” Lin Wenwen said, “Although I feel that’s quite impossible, the boy looks healthy. So, I guess I’ll just believe you. And you won’t hurt us, will you?”</p> <p>If Lin Qiao wanted to hurt them, why would she save them? Hence, she just gave a silent nod.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After returning to the zombies’ room, Lin Qiao closed the door, then turned to look at Xie Dong and said, “Say…”</p> <p><em>‘Ask any question you want.’</em></p> <p>The confused Xie Dong had been scanning Lin Qiao from head to toe with his eyes. So now, Lin Qiao had decided to let him ask all the questions he wanted to ask.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Qiu Lili and Junjun looked at them bewilderedly. The former walked to Xie Dong and looked at him from up to down, then took a circle around him. After confirming that he was really a zombie, she went back to her favorite chair by the window and sat down.</p> <p>Lin Qiao only said a word, yet Xie Dong had figured out her whole sentence. So, he made a writing gesture.</p> <p>Lin Qiao immediately handed him the clipboard and pen, then looked around the room to find somewhere to sit down. There were two armchairs and a small stool in the room. The stool was moved to the window side and was occupied by Qiu Lili. Meanwhile, Junjun and Tongtong were both sitting on the bed. Hence, the two armchairs were empty.</p> <p>She walked to the armchairs and sat down after choosing one, then pointed at the other one while looking at Xie Dong. The latter came over and took a seat, then wrote— <em>‘Are you really Lu Tianyu?’</em></p> <p>Reading that, Lin Qiao thought for a moment and then nodded, but soon shook her head. Without a surprise, Xie Dong looked at her confusedly. At the same time, Qiu Lili and Junjun were also looking at her curiously. Junjun leaned against the headboard while Tongtong was asleep by her side, covered by an old blanket.</p> <p>They had read Xie Dong’s questions, and too wanted to know Lin Qiao’s story.</p> <p>Junjun and Qiu Lili didn’t know that Lin Qiao was the name of a base leader. They might have heard about Chief Netherworld Fire, but they didn’t know her real name. Therefore, they didn’t pay extra attention to that name when Lin Qiao introduced herself to them.</p> <p>But earlier on, Lin Qiao told another name to the group of people she had found, and that had confused the two.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took over the clipboard, erased Xie Dong’s handwriting, and wrote—<em>‘I’m Lin Qiao. But, this body belonged to Lu Tianyu. When I woke up, she was already dead. Otherwise, this body wouldn’t have become a zombie. I woke up as a zombie.’</em></p> <p>There were lots of words to be written, so she wrote smaller letters. Having finished writing, she raised the clipboard to show it to the others.</p>",
  "Chapter 179: It Should Be Memory Loss": "<p>Xie Dong looked at Lin Qiao with silent confusion. <em> ‘What does she mean? Another individual came back to life in Lu Tianyu’s body? Reincarnation? Soul rebirth? Or what?’</em></p> <p>Judging by how Xie Dong felt about Lin Qiao, she was indeed different from the woman who was hated by everyone else. However, what she told him was way too unbelievable. A zombie with life memories like him still sounded reasonable, but a zombie with two people’s memories? Did that mean that the two people’s memories had merged together?</p> <p><em>‘Do you have Lu Tianyu’s memories?’ </em>—Xie Dong wrote on the clipboard, and Lin Qiao nodded in response. Lu Tianyu’s memories were still disordered, but they did exist in her mind.</p> <p>Xie Dong couldn’t understand her condition. He didn’t want to believe her, but from many aspects, she had proven it to him.</p> <p><em>‘But it’s absolutely unimaginable! Can such a thing really happen?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Well, the apocalypse happened, animals and plants mutated, over seventy percent of people in the world have become zombies or died, and superpowered human beings have emerged. Is anything still impossible?’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong thought quickly and soon accepted what Lin Qiao said.<br/>\nShe was Lin Qiao, not Lu Tianyu. However, she had borrowed Lu Tianyu’s body and name.</p> <p>Soon, he wrote down another question— <em>‘Since you’ve found your family, why didn’t you tell them your name?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him and blinked once before taking over the clipboard, erasing his question, and writing—’ <em>Have you heard about the Hades Base?’</em></p> <p>Seeing the name of the Hades Base, Xie Dong nodded.</p> <p>Of course, he knew about it. It was one of the eight bases of human survivors in the country. The other seven were the Sea City Base in the East, Huaxia Base in the middle, Dark Dragon Base in Northeast, Mongols Base in Inner Mongolia, Hidden Cloud Base in Tibet, Sky Fire Base built by the people from Yunnan and Sichuan, and the Earth Dragon Base in the South.</p> <p>As Xie Dong nodded, Lin Qiao continued writing— <em>‘Do you know Netherworld Fire, the leader of the Hades Base?’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong nodded again. Netherworld Fire was the leader of one of the two bases in South China, which was something he surely knew about. Earlier on, Lin Qiao told him that she would head South to find some people, so he now guessed that she found her family from the Hades Base.</p> <p><em>‘She’s pretty fast! She found her family and brought them back within just a week,’</em>he thought.</p> <p><em>‘The Hades Base </em>was broken <em>not long ago. There’s no Hades Base anymore. They were on the run. They heard that their leader was forced to blow herself up’ </em>—Lin Qiao wrote.</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t know that the Hades Base had already been conquered by the Earth Dragon Base. Reading Lin Qiao’s words, he stared at her and paused for a few seconds in shock.</p> <p>“Roar?”<br/>\n‘Really?’ He couldn’t help but roared to ask. Lin Qiao nodded and wrote—’I guess you don’t know who they are yet.’</p> <p>Then, she told him about Lin Feng, Yuan Tianxing, and the others. She told him that Lin Feng and the others of the Lin Family were the relatives of the leader of the Hades Base, and that Yuan Tianxing was the Deputy Chief of that base.</p> <p>At last, she wrote down a few large letters to show him— <em>‘Netherworld Fire’s real name was also Lin Qiao.’</em></p> <p>At that point, Qiu Lili and Junjun had come close to them. When they were communicating through writing, they ran over to read their notes because they were too curious. Reading the last few words written by Lin Qiao, the three of them were all stunned.</p> <p>Junjun looked at Lin Qiao while thinking, <em>‘According to her, Chief Netherworld Fire was also named Lin Qiao, and their families are the same. This </em>means, <em>they are the same person?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Eh…? Are you Netherworld Fire? The base leader?’ </em>Junjun pointed at Lin Qiao with surprise and asked internally. Qiu Lili and Xie Dong had been looking at her with the same look.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao shook her head and wrote <em>—’They are my relatives, but I don’t remember anything that happened in the past five years. I only remember things before the apocalypse. I don’t know why or how I became like this.’</em></p> <p>The other three gazed at her with confusion. What did she mean? Did she lose her memories?</p> <p><em>‘I think I’ve lost my memories,’ </em>Lin Qiao continued writing, <em>‘I feel that the Lin Qiao from the Hades Base was a different person. So, if I have time, I want to go to the South again.’</em></p> <p>The three slowly processed what she had said. They now understood that Lin Qiao the zombie was from the old world. She woke up to find that she had become a zombie, and that the whole world had changed. But still, she adapted to this world and her broken body.</p> <p>She had a strong mind, because of which, she didn’t waste too much time and headed South directly to find her family. At first, she didn’t even know if her relatives were still alive or not! She woke up five years after the apocalypse and found that the whole world was different. She knew that billions of people had died, but still confirmedly tried looking for her family.</p> <p>The other three zombies didn’t understand what made her so determined. What if she couldn’t find her family? What if her family had become zombies or died in zombies’ mouths?</p> <p>Anyway, she had found her relatives now. But before that, how confused had she been?</p> <p>After a lot of thinking, the three zombies weren’t all feeling low. Xie Dong was doing better than the other two, as his experience as a special forces soldier allowed him to adjust his emotions quickly.</p> <p>Unlike him, the two female zombies became a little gloomy. They used to be sentimental when they were human beings, and that stayed in their personalities even after they became zombies.</p> <p>Sensing their mood swings, Lin Qiao suddenly wanted to laugh. <em>‘Don’t be like this,’ she wrote. ‘I’ve found my family, haven’t I?’</em></p> <p>Qiu Lili and Junjun looked at her. <em>‘What if you didn’t find them? Would you keep looking?’ </em>Qiu Lili asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at the two of them. She had to keep looking, or she would have no meaning in her life as a zombie.</p> <p>Xie Dong rested his chin on his palm and thought for a moment.<br/>\n‘She has found her family, but also discovered her another self. And…the other Lin Qiao is dead. So…did her soul go directly into Lu Tianyu’s body after she blew herself up?’</p> <p><em>‘Did she lose a part of her memory?’</em></p> <p><em>‘That might be true, or why would she have the same name and family as Netherworld Fire?’</em></p> <p><em>‘No wonder she introduced herself to the group of </em>human <em>being as Lu Tianyu. She died, then came back to life in a zombie’s body, but has lost five years of memories. If she told those people that she was Lin Qiao, they might actually have beaten her!’</em></p> <p><em>‘After all, if someone…no, some zombie came to a group of people and told them that he or she is the relative of theirs who died not long </em>ago…no <em>normal person would believe that.’</em></p> <p>Qiu Lili didn’t think as much as Xie Dong did and only asked two questions.</p> <p>“Ahhyaya…”</p> <p><em>‘How long will we stay here? When will you go to the South?’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 180: Target: A Zombie City": "<p>Lin Qiao wrote on the clipboard— <em>‘We’ll leave this place in a few days. I’ve talked to them today. I told them to find a new place to build their base, because this place isn’t suitable.’</em></p> <p>She had thought about that earlier on when she was talking with Yuan Tianxing. However, she didn’t say much immediately, preparing to talk more to them tomorrow about the location of the new base.</p> <p>Xie Dong took over the clipboard and wrote— <em>‘Have you decided where the new base should be located?’</em></p> <p>‘I want them to find a large city which used to be bustling but is now an untouched zombie city,’ she wrote in response.</p> <p>She and Qiu Lili would allow the group of human beings to build a base in a large zombie city. They would select an area and drive the zombies away to create a zombie-free zone. But, this zone would be surrounded by zombies, so the outsiders wouldn’t be able to get in very easily.</p> <p>Much more and better supplies could be found in large cities than in this remote small town. As long as the zombie crowd could be controlled, human beings would be able to live in any of the large zombie cities without worry.</p> <p>Besides, most of the large zombie cites were occupied by high-level zombies which had each taken a territory. Lin Qiao could use some zombie nuclei to upgrade Viney.</p> <p>Reading Lin Qiao’s words, Xi Dong figured out her meaning the first. Qiu Lili didn’t quite understand why she wanted to find a zombie city, but she didn’t care. She would follow her anywhere anyway.</p> <p>Junjun thought about the giant zombie crowds in zombie cities and first felt that it would be very dangerous for Lin Qiao’s family and their people. But, she soon realized that those people would be with a zombie queen, a powerful mutant zombie at an unknown level, and a mutant male zombie. With these few powerful zombies, the group of human beings wouldn’t need to be afraid of any zombie crowd, no matter how huge it might be.</p> <p>But, which city should they go? A nearer one or a farther one? This place was about a ten hours’ drive away from Sea City, which might be a little too close.</p> <p>It would be better for them to pick a city that was relatively farther away.</p> <p>Southern China had more large cities than Northern China. However, as the deadly enemies of Lin Family were in the South, they could only choose a relatively larger zombie city in Zhe Province.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a while.  <em>‘Hangzhou had a large population, and it’s not far away. The center of Hangzhou City is just a short distance ahead.’</em></p> <p><em>‘Sea City Base people might have already been to Hangzhou, but I think there will still be some untouched forbidden areas there. I’ll talk to them tomorrow. We’ll head to Sea City Base first to find some people, and also to try finding some information about zombie cities,’ </em>she wrote.</p> <p>Finding out that they would go to the Sea City Base, Qiu Lili pouted unhappily. However, she didn’t make any sound, just taking two steps sideways.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her, then at Xie Dong. After that, she continued writing,<em>‘But, we won’t enter the Sea City Base. We all carry the virus, so we won’t pass their detection devices. Maybe we’ll split up.’</em></p> <p>Xie Dong nodded. He and Lin Qiao only looked like human beings, but their bodies still carried the virus.</p> <p><em>‘Is it okay for you to follow me like this?’ </em>Lin Qiao wrote a question down abruptly. Earlier on, she had told Xie Dong to follow her because she wanted to suppress his appetite for human flesh with her lake water. She was worried that he might be controlled by his desire and become a man-eating zombie. If that happened, he would be in serious trouble.</p> <p>However, she didn’t know if Xie Dong was willing to follow her. Perhaps, he had other plans for himself.</p> <p>Junjun followed her because of consideration for her son, and also because she had nowhere to go. By now, she trusted her completely. Like the former, Qiu Lili took her own initiative to follow Lin Qiao. Lin Qiao had observed Qiu Lili these days and found that she was great at self-control. At least, she wouldn’t eat human beings.</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at Lin Qiao and shook his head to tell her that it was fine.<br/>\nHe had told her that he would follow her a while ago. But later on, he and Lin Qiao were separated by the level-five ice-powered zombie.</p> <p>He was a little confused and helpless during the days without Lin Qiao. He wanted to find her, but how could he catch up with her car on foot? Besides, he was weak, not like Lin Qiao who had a space to hide from dangers.</p> <p>Therefore, he had been hiding for a few days. Every time he sensed high-level zombies or human beings, he would move away.</p> <p>He didn’t know if Lin Qiao would come back to Sea City or not, so he didn’t wait for her. A few days later, he found a zombie nucleus, which got him caught in trouble. But fortunately, he suddenly sensed that Lin Qiao was nearby. He didn’t know why he had sensed her, as it wasn’t like the sensation of zombies.</p> <p>As he didn’t say no, Lin Qiao sighed slightly in relief. She then glanced at Junjun and found that the dark circles under her eyes had faded a little. So, she wrote,<em>‘Junjun, your dark circles seem to have shrunk a little. Have you noticed?’</em></p> <p>Finishing writing, she showed Junjun the question. Reading that, Junjun looked at her with both surprise and confusion, then turned toward Qiu Lili.</p> <p>She didn’t quite understand Lin Qiao’s meaning.</p> <p>As Junjun turned to her, Qiu Lili read Lin Qiao’s question out of curiosity as well. Then, she carefully looked at Junjun’s eyes and found that her dark circles had truly turned smaller compared to before. Apart from her eyes, Junjun’s skin had changed a little too.</p> <p>Junjun’s face used to be bluish pale with some livor mortis, but that was gone now.</p> <p>Xie Dong hadn’t met Junjun before, so he couldn’t tell how she looked different from earlier. However, he saw the surprised by the look on Qiu Lili’s face.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was thinking about her lake water, which had been showing more and more miraculous effects. It could not only heal living human beings, but also cure the zombies.</p> <p>She put the clipboard on the table, then abruptly stood up and walked to Junjun. She pulled her shirt slightly downward, then checked her shoulder. As she had expected, the color of the wound on Junjun’s body had become lighter.</p> <p>Junjun was bitten by a zombie on the shoulder. When Lin Qiao saw her the first time, the shirt on the shoulder area was stained by blood. Back then, she had noticed her wound, the color of which was a lot deeper than now.</p> <p>It seemed that Junjun had drunk quite some water in her space, and often showered with the lake water. However, she didn’t go down in the lake to take a bath naked like Lin Qiao, but always fetched water with a bucket to shower herself.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had noticed the changes of Junjun’s body two days ago. But back at that time, she was eager to find Lin Feng and the others, and hence, didn’t observe her body closely. However, she had sensed that the latter’s vibe was obviously improved.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then wrote for Junjun— <em>‘From today, you should soak in the lake for an hour every day. If you are too afraid to go down into the lake, you can fill the tub in the bathroom with the lake water and soak yourself in it.’</em></p> <p>After reading that, Junjun looked at her with confusion while Lin Qiao continued writing— <em>‘I think you’ll upgrade soon. You’re thinking and reacting faster than before, haven’t you noticed that?’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 181: Going In Separate Ways": "<p>The next day, Lin Qiao told Junjun and Qiu Lili to stay in the room and then went to Yuan Tianxing’s room with Xie Dong.</p> <p>The door was opened, and Wei Jingchen let them in. Except for the few soldiers, the whole group of people was in the room, including the Lin Family, Long Qingying, Du Yuanxing, and Yuan Tianxing. It seemed that they were expecting Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing were sitting on the couch, while Mr. Lin and Cheng Wangxue were sitting on the chairs by the window.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked in and smilingly nodded to everyone, then walked to the empty couch and sat down. Like what Junjun did the last time, Xie Dong stood behind her.</p> <p>Without a doubt, he attracted the roomful of people’s eyes. Yesterday, only Long Qingying and Lin Wenwen saw him closely, and the others only looked at him through the windows from a long distance away.</p> <p>Xie Dong’s sudden appearance didn’t surprise Lin Feng and the others. At first, Lin Qiao was with the red-eyed female zombie, and yesterday, another female zombie showed up, carrying a child. Now, she was with this man whose body was straightened, head raised, and chest puffed. Without question, this man used to be a soldier. His military presence was even stronger than that of Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing, who were both experienced soldiers.</p> <p>However, Xie Dong’s military presence didn’t attract the attention of Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing. Most human beings outside the bases were either superpowered ones or former soldiers. The superpowered ones had competitive individual combat capacity while soldiers had good mental quality and strain capacity. Apart from them, some other people also developed great abilities. Outside the bases, these kinds of people weren’t rare.</p> <p>Therefore, Yuan Tianxing and Lin Feng didn’t pay too much attention to Xie Dong, waiting until Lin Qiao sat down and then started talking.</p> <p>“Yesterday, you said that we should find another place to build the new base, and that we better find a zombie city. We’ve discussed about that, and decided to go to the center of Hangzhou City. That place is definitely filled with zombies.” Yuan Tianxing took out a map of China and spread it on the table, pointing at Hangzhou on the map as he spoke.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then took out the clipboard and pen to write, ‘Maybe we should first figure out the condition of the forbidden area in that city, then make the decisions.’</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing glanced at her and asked, “Are you saying that we should first locate the forbidden area in the city center, then head straight to it?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and continued writing, ‘Aren’t you going to the Sea City Base to find people? We can explore the city after that, or we can split up.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and Lin Feng glanced at each other. “Are you trying to say that you can go and scout the city first? Do you want us to go find our people first, then wait for your message before making future plans?” Lin Feng said with surprise.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded in response. Yuan Tianxing pondered for a short while, then said, “That can work. We aren’t sure if we can find Li Zheng and his people or not. If they’re in the Sea City Base, we should be able to find them quickly. But, if they’re out here, we might need to spend more time to look for them. In that case, you should use that time to check out the city center.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, he looked at Lin Feng to seek his opinion. The latter nodded in agreement and said, “You’re zombies, so you can’t follow us into the base. Exploring a zombie city should be the right job for you. But, we need someone to stay and guard this place. I’ll stay.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen had already put all the food they found in this place into her space. But before leaving, they still needed to disassemble the solar power equipment and bring that with them.</p> <p>In case some other people might come here for the solar power equipment, a powerful one needed to stay here, and Lin Feng felt that he should be the one to do that.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing was capable of taking a squad to the Sea City Base, and Lu Tianyu the zombie and her friends were well placed to explore the zombie city.</p> <p>Both Yuan Tianxing and Lin Qiao were thinking about the same thing as he did.</p> <p>‘I agree,’ Lin Qiao wrote while Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “Good! I’ll leave for the Sea City Base with Du Yuanxing and the other three. Lin Feng, you and Qingying stay here to protect Mrs. Lin and the others.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Lin Feng both nodded while the former wrote on the clipboard, ‘I’ll leave tomorrow.’</p> <p>As an agreement was reached, Lin Qiao left Yuan Tianxing’s room. She didn’t mind the others’ intentional or unintentional glances at her bald head, but felt that her head was a little cold.</p> <p>Back in the zombies’ room, Lin Qiao filled the tub with the lake water from her space for Junjun to bathe in it.</p> <p>Junjun put Tongtong on the bed, then went into the bathroom. However, once she walked away, the boy burst into tears. He wouldn’t let the others hold him, only wanting his mother.</p> <p>Lin Qiao tried for a while but failed, then she put Tongtong in Junjun’s arms and pushed both of them into the bathroom together.</p> <p>“Go…bathe…together…”</p> <p>After solved the problem, Lin Qiao went into Xie Dong’s room that was next door and filled him a tubful of water as well, telling him to bathe in it.</p> <p>After her space was upgraded, the energy in the lake water had grown much stronger than before. So, when Lin Qiao closed her eyes, she could see a tubful of green water. It was vivid green, not dark-green like the water in the lake.</p> <p>She opened her eyes, and the water in her physical eyes was still transparent.</p> <p>In the afternoon, Lin Qiao stood behind the window and saw Yuan Tianxing, Du Yuanxing, Xing Le, and Su Liang leave the hotel building. When walking past the huge metal cage, the four men spent a short while looking at those turtles.</p> <p>At night, Lin Qiao sent Junjun, Tongtong, and Qiu Lili into her space, letting them rest there while she herself stayed outside in the room. Then, she turned off the light and lied on the bed, looking at the ceiling with her dark eyes, which sparkled dimly in the darkness.</p> <p>As a zombie, she didn’t need to sleep. However, she had nothing else to do at night except lying on the bed and thinking.</p> <p>A while later, she suddenly turned her face to look outside the window. She heard no sound from the outside, but smelled some scents of human beings. Those scents didn’t belong to the ones in this building, but to some other people.</p> <p>She immediately sat up and got off the bed to walk to the window, looking at the black and white world. She could see colors during the daytime, but at night, she could only see black and white like before.</p> <p>She crossed her arms before her chest and quietly leaned against the window frame, her black eyes looking straight ahead.</p> <p>‘I had killed one of them yesterday, so how are they bringing themselves to me?’</p> <p>That was right, the human scents she sensed belonged to the ones who were chasing Xie Dong yesterday.\n</p>",
  "Chapter 182: Are You Stupid?": "<p>In a building which was hundreds of meters away from the hotel, a man was sneakily observing the hotel building through a telescope.</p> <p>“Have you found anything?”</p> <p>“Shh, quiet! I’m trying to see…That building has tens of floors, but only the rooms on one floor have lights on. The power in this town has been off long ago, so they must be using the solar power.”</p> <p>“Solar power? Are you sure?”</p> <p>“Or, you tell me how they generated electricity?”</p> <p>“If there’s solar power equipment, that place must have been untouched before…It seems that the people in that building have killed the level-five zombie leader nearby. That is a huge hotel, so there must be sealed cold storages inside. Perhaps, the cold storages are directly powered by the solar energy. Will there be large amounts of frozen food?”</p> <p>“That’s possible!”</p> <p>“Should we go over there?”</p> <p>“Be patient and observe the situation first.”</p> <p>“Alright!”</p> <p>“Think about it. A level-five zombie is supposed to be nearby. However, those people have been staying in that hotel building restfully, which means that the zombie leader was already killed by them. Therefore, they have one level-six or three level-five members at the very least. We’re no match for them now, so it’ll be meaningless for us to go over there for now.”</p> <p>“Are you saying that…”</p> <p>“You, take two men and go back to the base to report to our Deputy Chief. Tell him that we have found solar power equipment. He’ll definitely come.”</p> <p>“Alright! Let’s do as you said.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed these people who were hidden in the darkness, but as they were hundreds of meters away and talking in very low voices, she couldn’t make out their words, even though she had good hearing.</p> <p>She sensed their scents and saw the dimly glistening light of the telescope.<br/>\nThose people were staying motionless. Lin Qiao guessed that they were still trying to figure out the situation by observing.</p> <p>Abruptly, she stood straight and disappeared from beside the window. Then, an invisible figure flashed out of the window, quietly darting toward those people.</p> <p>Hundreds of meters wasn’t a long distance; with a few leaps, she quickly hopped onto the building that those people were staying in. She made a circle on the roof, then found two vehicles parked in the dark alley next to the building. Those were the same cars she had seen yesterday.</p> <p>At that point, a few people sneakily came out of the building and got onto one of the two cars. Soon, the car was started and driven away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the car, then turned her head to sense the vibes in the building. Most from the group of people stayed in the building, and only a few went out and drove the car away. What were they going to do?</p> <p>‘It seems that they have found out about the solar power equipment, and are observing the situation. Did the couple of people leave to make a report to someone? Or, are they heading back to their base to find powerful helpers, because they’ve realized that they can’t win against Lin Feng and his people?’</p> <p>With these guesses, Lin Qiao leaped out from the roof and followed behind the car. She moved way faster than the car, and soon landed on the roof of a small building.</p> <p>There was an overline bridge near her. She sprung onto the bridge and climbed onto the guard bar. When the car passed under the bridge, she jumped and quietly landed on the car roof.</p> <p>“Boss, do you really trust him? What if he took the solar power equipment without us?”</p> <p>“Are you stupid? A level-five zombie often appeared in this area, and now, those people are staying in that hotel building. The zombie leader should be able to sense these people from miles away, but why didn’t it come to attack them? Because they have killed it! They are much more powerful than us. Even if Lv Duyao wants to take the solar power equipment by himself, he doesn’t have the power to do it.”</p> <p>“You’re right.”</p> <p>Standing on the car roof, Lin Qiao listened to their conversation and told herself that she had guessed correctly. These people were planning to seize the solar power equipment. They were worried that they might fail, so the few in the car were sent to find help.</p> <p>She smiled and showed her face, then took the sunglasses out of her pocket and put them on.</p> <p>‘You saw us, and you want to rob us. Moreover, you’re going to find help?’<br/>\nLin Qiao squatted on the car roof and slowly reached her hand to the window on the driver’s side. A wisp of dense and dark mist was released from her palm, drilling into the car through the window.</p> <p>The mist spread in the car, merging into the darkness, soon getting into their ears. The driver who was looking around to check the situation on the road suddenly froze up.</p> <p>“Eh? What’s this?” Shen Chengming, who was in the front seat, noticed a stream of black mist flowing toward his ears and dodged automatically.</p> <p>Once he turned his head, he saw the frozen driver. The driver couldn’t keep holding the steering wheel, so the car slowly moved to the roadside. Shen Chengming gave a start, then hurriedly leaned over and reached out his hand to control the steering wheel.</p> <p>“Damn! Do you know how to drive? The car is going to hit…” He held the steering wheel and burst in yells, his eyes focused on the road. Then, he turned back his head, prepared to say something more to the driver. However, he suddenly saw that the driver’s face slowly disappeared. It was like it had melted suddenly, and then his entire head began melting as well.</p> <p>Soon, Shen Chengming watched the driver’s head vanish entirely.</p> <p>After witnessing that scary scene, Shen Chengming was stunned. A few seconds later, he realized what had happened.</p> <p>He turned to look at the few in the backseat and found that they were all headless like the driver, sitting stiffly.</p> <p>Shivers ran down his spine. He turned around to find that the driver’s neck was gone as well, and the rest of his body was melting in a weird way as well.</p> <p>He immediately let go of the steering wheel and turned back to open the car door and jump out. After making a roll on the ground, he squatted by the roadside to look at the car.</p> <p>As he jumped out, no one was left in the car to drive. Soon, the car rubbed against the roadside and hit the flower bed.</p> <p>Squeak…Boom!</p> <p>Shen Chengming breathed quietly, alertly watching the car hit the flower bed and stop. He had absolutely no idea what had happened, and didn’t know why the others suddenly lost their heads. It was like a horror movie, but fortunately, he had a strong heart.</p>",
  "Chapter 183: They’re Gone": "<p>To Shen Chengming, it wasn’t just scary, but had also given him a strong sense of danger. After the car stopped, he squatted where he was and alertly looked around, then slowly stood up to move toward the car.</p> <p>Holding the flashlight with one hand, he vigilantly approached the car while glancing around. Then, he stood by the door of the front seat and shone the light inside, only to find that the people in the car were all gone.</p> <p>He only looked into the car for a few seconds before stepping away. Earlier when he jumped off, he didn’t see anyone else get off the car, meaning that the others had all disappeared inside.</p> <p>Recalling how their heads melted and vanished, he felt colder and colder.</p> <p>In the next moment, he stepped away from the car because he saw that the car was also disappearing from the inside. His friends were gone, and so were the seats; the car itself had also been vanishing slowly.</p> <p>As he moved backward step by step, his fine hair suddenly stood straight up. His heart thumped as a bad feeling occurred to him.</p> <p>However, the feeling came too late. Before he dodged, a hand with sharp claws was swung toward his neck from less than a meter behind him.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>Following a slight noise, he paused.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took a step forward and reached out a hand to take off Shen Chengming’s head, then cut it open and dig out the nucleus. After that, she threw the head away.</p> <p>She entered her space and threw the nucleus into the lake, then came back out and waved her hand toward the car. A stream of dark mist drifted out of the car. Maybe because it had absorbed the energy of the few people, Lin Qiao felt that it was a little denser than before.</p> <p>Then, she glanced at the car. It looked good from the outside, but was empty on the inside.</p> <p>She turned to run toward the next building. Getting closer to the building, she grabbed the edge of the wall and swung herself upward, quickly climbing onto the roof.</p> <p>If these people weren’t targeting Lin Feng and his people, Lin Qiao wouldn’t kill them so brutally. However, they had already found the hotel building, and Lin Feng’s people couldn’t disassemble the solar power equipment and leave immediately. Besides, these people had shown a murderous intention toward Lin Feng and his people, so Lin Qiao didn’t see a reason to show mercy to them.</p> <p>She would get rid of everything and everyone that might threaten Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>She leaped across roofs to head back to the building where she had found the group of people, realizing that they were still waiting in that building.</p> <p>“Boss, you sent him back to report to Deputy Chief, but do you think he’ll really bring Deputy Chief here?”</p> <p>“I think he can. Shh…quiet…I feel that something is wrong.”</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>“Earlier on, I noticed that this area is very quiet, without any zombie. I’ve been observing the whole afternoon, and no zombie was found near the hotel. They don’t even have a guard.”</p> <p>“What? No guard? Aren’t they afraid of a zombie attack?”</p> <p>“I don’t know about their situation. We need to get closer for a better vision. Pack your things! We’ll move two-hundred meters toward the hotel.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was in a corner behind them, hiding under a layer of dark mist. In the dark room, no one noticed that a creature had come in and was listening to their conversation from a corner.</p> <p>‘You are so bad at observing. It took you a whole afternoon to notice what’s abnormal around here,’ she thought. Even though this place was a town, the hotel was located in the town center. This area shouldn’t be crowded by zombies, but it was absolutely not normal for it to be zombie-free. These people should have noticed it long ago.</p> <p>While watching these people begin moving, Lin Qiao made herself invisible. Before the last man left, she quietly showed up and covered his mouth with her hand. At the same time, the black mist gushed into his mouth and nose from her palm.</p> <p>With that, the man stopped moving instantly. Lin Qiao gently put the body on the ground, then quietly followed behind the others. Around the corner of the stairs, she dragged the second last man back and smoothly killed him with the dark mist as well. After that, she leaned against the stair railing and looked down.</p> <p>The others were still moving forward; none of them had noticed that two of their men were missing.</p> <p>One by one, Lin Qiao finished off half of these men without being noticed by the others. Finally, one man glanced back at the rest of the team, but saw nothing as a result.</p> <p>“Ali? Bao? Oi…Why are you guys so slow?”</p> <p>“What’s wrong? Hearing his voice, the others all stopped moving and turned back to look at him.”</p> <p>“Ali and Bao and the others are missing.”</p> <p>“Where did they go?”</p> <p>“I don’t know…”</p> <p>Even after spending a short while talking, none of them saw anyone coming down; they didn’t even hear any noise.</p> <p>“Cate, you go upstairs and check,” Lv Duyao said to a man.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao leaped out of the window by the stairs on the sixth floor. After landing, she walked to the entrance of the building and waited.</p> <p>Soon, the group of men came down in panic.</p> <p>Half of their team was suddenly gone, yet they hadn’t seen any enemy or anything else for that matter. Their friends just disappeared, and they didn’t even know if they were dead or alive.</p> <p>Facing the mysterious enemy, none of them could stay calm.</p> <p>Once they came down, they saw a figure standing by the entrance. Some of them pointed the flashlight toward Lin Qiao and found that she was bald and wearing sunglasses at night.</p> <p>“Who are you?” Lv Duyao shone Lin Qiao’s eyes with the flashlight and asked, but the latter ignored him. As all of these people came down, a stream of dark mist slowly rose from her palm.</p> <p>The men behind Lv Duyao pointed their guns at Lin Qiao. Lv Duyao was the only one who didn’t have a gun. He had sharp sensations, which allowed him to sense the intention of killing from Lin Qiao once he saw her.</p> <p>Soon, he thought of the people in the hotel. He thought that those people had found them and this was their strike.</p> <p>“Was it you just now?”</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao didn’t answer his question.</p> <p>“You…What did you do to our friends?” A man behind Lv Duyao asked.<br/>\nMeanwhile, a faint black mist spread in the darkness, approaching the group of men. However, they didn’t notice it at all.</p> <p>Slowly, the mist touched their heads and drilled into their noses and ears, but they still didn’t realize it. Like the people from before, they soon stopped moving, standing there like statues.</p> <p>Only Lv Duyao made a sudden step backward and dodged to the side when the black mist got close to him.</p>",
  "Chapter 184: Find Zombie Queen": "<p>Lin Qiao moved swiftly as well and then disappeared.</p> <p>Lv Deyao dodged to the side and squatted while looking around alertly to search for Lin Qiao. However, he couldn’t find a trace of that mysterious bald figure.</p> <p>He knew that he and his teammates were in serious trouble this time. The enemy didn’t even say a word to them before attacking. He glanced at his teammates, who still made no movement, then had an awful feeling.</p> <p>He didn’t see Lin Qiao’s face. It was dark, and all he saw was a bald head and a pair of sunglasses, nothing else.</p> <p>He figured that it was an average height man.</p> <p>At that point, Lv Duyao had no idea that Lin Qiao was standing right behind him. An invisible hand reached out toward his head from behind. About half a meter away from his head, the hand flicked slightly, then turned visible.</p> <p>While showing her face, Lin Qiao inserted her claws into Lv Duyao’s head.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>Lv Duyao sensed a coldness from his back, then his head was pierced from behind. He popped out his eyes, looking ahead with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pulled out her hand, and between her fingers was a faintly glowing energy nucleus.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>As Lin Qiao took her hand back, Lv Duyao softly fell to the ground. She raised her head to look at the few men who had been disappearing slowly. Then, she waved her hand, and a few wisps of dark mist drifted back to her, coiling around her arm.</p> <p>Afterward, she pointed a finger at Lv Duyao, who was lying on the ground. Along her finger, the black mist drifted onto his body and soon swallowed him.</p> <p>At that point, no one in the world knew that this group of people had died. The man who had trampled upon Xie Dong yesterday left a body, but the others disappeared completely.</p> <p>Earlier on, Xie Dong asked Lin Qiao not to kill these people, so she let them go. But in just a day, they came back to die…Some people were just unlucky.</p> <p>After collecting the black mist, Lin Qiao threw the nucleus into the lake in her space, then slowly walked toward the hotel.</p> <p>Back at the hotel, she saw a man squatting before the large metal cage, playing with those turtles with a mouse dangling in his hand. She walked to the cage and looked at those turtles as she said, “Killed…the people…yesterday…”</p> <p>Xie Dong threw the mouse into the cage, then stood up and turned to nod at her. When she left the hotel, he had sensed her. He didn’t follow her out, but waited in the parking lot while keeping track of her vibe.</p> <p>It was the second time for his enemies to send themselves to Lin Qiao, and it was reasonable for her to kill them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked back toward the hotel building, directly leaping onto a window frame and climbing up the building. For some reason, she enjoyed climbing more and more after becoming a zombie.</p> <p>Xie Dong watched Lin Qiao slide into her room through the window, then silently walked into the lobby.</p> <p>After Lin Yuanting had left with a squad, Wei Jingchen and Xiao Wenxing were the only two guards left in the hotel, guarding by Lin Feng’s door.</p> <p>Next morning, Lin Qiao got up early and took off with Xie Dong, leaving Qiu Lili and Junjun in the hotel. On one hand, she wanted Junjun and Tongtong to spend some time with Mrs. Lin and Lin Xiaolu, and on the other, she wanted Qiu Lili to guard the people in the hotel. If anything happened there, she could be highly helpful. Even though Qiu Lili might not be willing to help the group of human beings, she would at least keep them safe for Lin Qiao.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao and Xie Dong left the hotel for Hangzhou, a motorcade came out of the Sea City Base.</p> <p>Xiao LiCheng was driving in the vehicle in the middle of the motorcade, with Meng Yue sitting in the front seat, Wu Chengyue, Xiao Yunlong, and the little Wu Yueling were in the backseat.</p> <p>Wu Yueling sat between Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>While playing with Wu Yueling, Xiao Yunlong said, “Will we run into level-six zombies in Hangzhou this time? That’s a zombie city with millions of zombies. There’re certainly a lot of level-five zombies, but I wonder if there will be any zombie king or queen.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and responded, “What happened to your sources of information? Haven’t you heard from Zou Shihui that a zombie king is in the city?”</p> <p>“Eh? Really?” Xiao Yunlong looked at him with surprise, “Why don’t I know that? Did he tell you that?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave him a meaningful smile but stayed silent. Receiving the look in his eyes, Xiao Yunlong blinked and asked, “You’re not going to…”</p> <p>“Don’t you know?” Meng Yue turned around and said, “He came out especially to find that zombie king this time. He paid quite a price to get that information from Chief Zou.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong glanced at Meng Yue, then back at Wu Chengyue. Suddenly, he pointed at Wu Yueling and said with discontent, “If you’re going for the zombie king, why did you bring Ling Ling? What if anything bad happens to her?”</p> <p>He thought that they were going merely to collect supplies. In that case, Wu Yueling would be perfectly safe staying with her father. But, he now found out that they were going to try killing a zombie king. That would be much, much more dangerous.</p> <p>Zombie queens and kings were legendary. Xiao Yunlong hadn’t seen one himself, but he had heard that every time with a zombie queen or king showed up, most of the people who saw it would die, not to mention killing it.</p> <p>Level-seven superpowered human beings like Wu Chengyue might be able to kill a zombie queen or king, but it still wouldn’t be easy.</p> <p>At that point, Meng Yue added, “We heard that that zombie king has lightning power.”</p> <p>Finishing talking, she looked at Wu Chengyue?</p> <p>‘Lightning power?’ Hearing that, Xiao Yunlong turned to Wu Chengyue as well. Instantly, he figured out why the latter would bring them out of the base in such a haste.</p> <p>‘But…’</p> <p>“Then, it’s even more dangerous than I thought! No, we need to send Ling Ling back! Don’t you make such kind of joke with my god daughter’s life!” While speaking, Xiao Yunlong turned back and prepared to order Xiao Licheng to stop the car. Seeing that, Wu Chengyue hurriedly stopped him.</p> <p>“Wait for a second, hear me first. I’m going to find the zombie king alone. At that time, you two will be looking after Ling Ling. What can possibly happen as long as you’re here?” Wu Chengyue dragged him with one hand and said.</p> <p>Hearing that, Xiao Yuanlong paused for a second, then stared at him with disbelief as he said, “What! You’re going alone! That’s insanely dangerous!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled at him but didn’t say a word.</p> <p>“Or what?” Said Meng Yue coldly, “You go with him? How can you help him? By making the task even harder?’</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong was left speechless.</p>",
  "Chapter 185: Where Did The Dragonfly Come From?": "<p>Xiao Yunlong looked at Wu Chengyue confusedly and asked, “Eh? I mean…if you don’t want our help, why did you bring so many people?”<br/>\nWu Yueling raised her head to give him a glance, then climbed onto Wu Chengyue’s lap.</p> <p>People said that daughters were their fathers’ previous life’s lovers. Seeing the clingy Wu Yueling, Xiao Yunlong totally believed in it.</p> <p>Wu Yuecheng held his daughter and gave a faint smile as he said, “Are you dumb? I said I’m going to find the zombie king, but we’ll still be collecting supplies. We haven’t touched that area yet, because there were too many zombies. If we find that zombie king and kill it, we’ll be able to bag ourselves all the supplies stored in its territory. If we can’t find it, our main job will still be collecting supplies.</p> <p>Meng Yue rolled her eyes, then said to Xiao Yunlong, “I wonder how your brain works…But never mind! I think all the nutrition you absorbed has been put into your muscles, and your brain is undernourished.”</p> <p>After saying that, she turned back to check the situation on the road.</p> <p>“Um…Yue, you can just say that I’m silly, I won’t mind. But undernourished brain? Can you make it simpler?” Xiao Yunlong said. Meng Yue rolled her eyes while Wu Chengyue gave a bigger smile.</p> <p>Wu Yueling widely opened her shiny black eyes as she looked at them. Xiao Yunlong touched her little nose and asked, “Do you understand your Aunt Yue’s words? She said that my brain is undernourished. She’s simply saying that I’m silly. Silly, do you understand silly? Ling Ling, do you understand?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue rubbed his daughter’s hair as he chuckled and said to her, “Don’t talk to him. His silliness is contagious.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Yueling immediately curled her limbs to keep a distance from Xiao Yunlong. Seeing that, Xiao Yunlong was a little unhappy. “Eh? Eh? Why am I contagious? How am I silly? I surely know what your father is up to, how can I not?”</p> <p>While speaking, he tried to play with Wu Yueling. However, the latter refused to respond to him, turning her face away.</p> <p>At that moment, Xiao Yunlong saw something in her pocket that looked like a grass. So, he reached out a hand toward it.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, what’s this?” While speaking, he grabbed the dry grass and pulled that thing out of Wu Yueling’s pocket, as she wasn’t looking at him. After that, he found that it was a grass dragonfly, dried and dark-brown in color, but exquisitely made.</p> <p>Feeing that something was pulled out of her pocket, Wu Yueling immediately turned back and saw that Xiao Yunlong was holding her grass dragonfly and looking at it.</p> <p>She pounced on him and reached out her arms to try and take it back. She had forgotten about the contagious thing, and only wanted to take her toy back.</p> <p>However, Xiao Yunlong was an adult, so how could she possibly win against him? He raised his hand and threw the grass dragonfly up, then caught it with the other hand.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, tell your godfather, where did you get this? I don’t remember making you this.” Xiao Yunlong reached the grass dragonfly to his left side to keep Wu Yueling from touching it.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was also looking at the grass dragonfly curiously. He didn’t realize that his daughter had it either. Meng Yue turned around to look at it too. She found the grass dragonfly rather cute, just a little dry and dark-colored.</p> <p>“Eh? It’s quite delicate!” While speaking, she took it over from Xiao Yunlong’s hand and put it on her own palm.</p> <p>Wu Yueling spent a while fighting Xiao Yunlong but failed to get her precious little toy back. Now, as the grass dragonfly ended up in Meng Yue’s hand, she suddenly realized that she wouldn’t get it back soon enough.</p> <p>So, she pulled a long face and pouted, then angrily sat back between Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>“Eh? Ling Ling? Are you angry?” Wu Chengyue looked at her with surprise. He found that within these couple of seconds, the expressions on his daughter’s face had been changing vividly.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong was observing her too. “I think she is,” he said with his eyes glowing. “Haven’t you noticed that ever since she came back, she has been showing many of her feelings on her face? That’s a good thing.” In fact, all three of them had noticed that long ago. Wu Yueling was less afraid of people than before. At least, she wouldn’t try to hide once she saw Xiao Yunlong as she used to.</p> <p>Moreover, she was much friendlier to Xiao Licheng too, who was driving the car.</p> <p>At that moment, a tiny grass grew out of Meng Yue’s palm. The grass glowed faintly and leaned against the grass dragonfly.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, look,” Meng Yue smiled to Wu Yueling and said. While she was speaking, a light greenness was slowly sent into the dried grass dragonfly from the tiny grass. Soon, the grass dragonfly turned green and lively again, as though made from fresh grass blades.</p> <p>Seeing that, Wu Yueling paused in surprise. She fixed her eyes on the grass dragonfly, even forgetting that she was angry. Meng Yue then handed her the dragonfly; judging by her reaction just now, she must be treasuring that little toy greatly.</p> <p>“Can you tell Dad who made you this pretty grass dragonfly?” Wu Chengyue smilingly asked Wu Yueling as she carefully took the dragonfly over.</p> <p>Wu Yueling glanced at him, but didn’t answer his question. She ignored the others and put the grass dragonfly back into her pocket, then covered her pocket with a hand. After that, she moved to the other side of Wu Chengyue, to get further away from Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>In addition to that, she pushed Wu Chengyue to the middle of the backseat.</p> <p>Seeing this, both Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong felt a little speechless. Meng Yue looked at them with a grin and said, “Our Ling Ling has grown up. Don’t you bully her, or when she wants to take her revenge, you’ll end up dead.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and rubbed Wu Yueling’s head while pulling her closer to him. Xiao Yunlong looked at her and continued asking, “Where did the little girl get the grass dragonfly from? It looked days old, and it’s dried.”</p> <p>Meng Yue shook her head and replied, “I didn’t make it. I don’t know how to make small things like that. And, there’s nothing strange in that grass dragonfly. I’ve checked that it’s clean.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong immediately turned to Wu Chengyue, who smilingly asked him, “Why are you looking at me? Have you ever seen me making little things like that?”</p> <p>“Who gave it to her then?” Xiao Yunlong murmured confusedly.<br/>\nWu Yueling hadn’t spent time with any other people but the three of them since she came back, so where did she get that little toy from?</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong was still confused, while Wu Chengyue thought of a possibility. Judging by the grass dragonfly’s condition, Ling Ling should have obtained it before returning to the base. It was just that she had been hiding it well, such that even her father didn’t find it.</p>",
  "Chapter 186: The Zombie In The Bookstore": "<p>Lin Qiao and Xie Dong had also been driving toward Hangzhou City. The city wasn’t far, just hours away.</p> <p>It was the same car, and Xie Dong became the driver again. He enjoyed driving his car. He was away for only about ten days, but he missed his car already.</p> <p>Three hours later, they entered the city. As expected, more and more zombies showed up, shambling around. The closer they got to the city center, the more zombies were seen.</p> <p>Zombies could be found in every street and alley and in all sorts of buildings. The ordinary zombies which sensed Lin Qiao would all start to move away while they were still tens of meters away from her, as though they couldn’t risk getting close to her. Most of them were crowded in nearby streets or alleys.</p> <p>Xie Dong kept driving on the unimpeded road while Lin Qiao was sticking her head out of the window in the front seat to look around.</p> <p>When the car passed by a bookstore, she raised a hand to signal for Xie Dong to pull over. The latter turned toward the bookstore, then parked the car before it.</p> <p>Then, they both got off the car and glanced at the broken door of the bookstore before walking in.</p> <p>“Roar!” Once they got in, a zombie roar was heard, delivering a threatening and warning message. Hearing that, Lin Qiao and Xie Dong both realized that they had stepped into the small territory of a relatively high-level zombie, which was at about level-three.</p> <p>They turned toward where the roar came from and saw a zombie on the second floor, leaning against the stair railing while staring at them with its teeth bared.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ignored it and just calmly walked in toward the map shelf. But of course, she didn’t intend to show mercy to this level-three zombie.</p> <p>A level-three zombie nucleus wouldn’t contain a giant amount of energy, yet it would still be valuable.</p> <p>On the other side, Xie Dong didn’t move, glancing at Lin Qiao. Once she moved inward, the zombie uttered another roar while fiercely staring at her like a raging beast.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Before coming into this bookstore, Lin Qiao had restrained her vibe, as she had sensed the level-three zombie already. That was the reason why the level-three zombie dared to roar at her like that.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ignored the zombie again and kept moving forward.</p> <p>The zombie had finally lost its patience. It climbed onto the railing, then jumped down at Lin Qiao. It didn’t wonder why she made no response to its roars, only wanting to kill this invader as fast as possible.</p> <p>However, it didn’t even manage to approach Lin Qiao. When the zombie was still about a meter away, Lin Qiao abruptly raised a hand and swung her claw at it.</p> <p>Puff! Thud! Thud!</p> <p>Following the series of noises, the zombie was cut into two and fell on the ground, its black blood splashing all over the ground. Xie Dong glanced at the dead zombie and then turned around to lean against the door with his arms crossed, looking outside.</p> <p>It was almost noontime; The sun was burning, and it was actually quite hot. But, he couldn’t feel the temperature, only Lin Qiao could. That was why she wore the hat, because she didn’t want her bald head to smoke under the sun.</p> <p>Lin Qiao kept looking for the map shelf. The bookstore wasn’t large, and there were signs, so she found it soon.</p> <p>This place had been visited by human survivors before. Lin Qiao found the map shelf and found that many maps were gone. Fortunately, the last batch of visitors still left her a couple of map books.</p> <p>She picked up one and first shook the dust off, then slapped and swung it. Finally, the thick layer of dust on the book was gone.</p> <p>She leafed through it and found that it was a map book for tourists, mainly introducing the famous scenic spots in the province. It wasn’t so useful, but could help her in recognizing places.</p> <p>She then checked another book: it was a driver’s map of this province.</p> <p>After collecting these two map books, Lin Qiao turned to check the other books. She only roughly browsed some of them, then put all of them into her space along with the shelves.</p> <p>About twenty minutes later, the bookstore was emptied by her. Then, she dug out the level-three zombie’s nucleus and left the bookstore with Xie Dong.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put the car into her space. The two of them stood by the roadside to check for directions, and then chose one direction to go.</p> <p>They were already in the city now. This place was filled with zombies, so the car became unnecessary. Driving in this area would be a waste of gas. Lin Qiao needed to restrain her vibe and hunt for higher level zombies, so they couldn’t drive fast.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked for about ten meters, to a building which had over ten floors.</p> <p>She hopped onto an abandoned old bus in front of the building, then turned and leaped onto the building. Within a blink, she had grabbed a window frame on the sixth floor, then swung herself up to a balcony, leaping higher afterward.</p> <p>Xie Dong watched Lin Qiao nimbly climb onto the roof, then leaped into a balcony from the top of the bus. He wasn’t as agile as Lin Qiao, so he climbed much slower than she did.</p> <p>On the roof, Lin Qiao sniffed around and sensed a strong zombie stench mixed with all sorts of smells. Without waiting for Xie Dong, she leaped toward another building.</p> <p>She didn’t need to sniff around like a dog if she were only looking for higher level zombies, because she could sense any higher level zombie within the area two or three miles around her.</p> <p>She sniffed the air for the scents of human beings, as she wanted to know if any living human beings were in or had been in this area. This area was at the outskirts of the city. Many zombies existed in this place, but they weren’t scary enough to keep human beings away from here.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed some faint scents left by human beings from quite some spots. However, those people weren’t there now. The scents should have been left by them yesterday or the day before that.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed a level-four zombie from two miles away, so she moved toward that direction.</p> <p>Xie Dong climbed up the first building, then saw that Lin Qiao was already three buildings away from him. So, he hurriedly followed up. He didn’t know why she went that way, but he didn’t care, only following behind her.</p> <p>He was at a lower level than Lin Qiao, so he wasn’t as powerful as she was, and his sensations weren’t as keen as hers. Therefore, even if he did want to know why she chose that direction, he had no way of finding out.</p> <p>He considered himself lucky for meeting Lin Qiao before turning into a zombie. If he hadn’t met her, he might have become a soulless zombie.<br/>\nHe would chew human flesh and eat human brains like a beast.</p> <p>Xie Dong pictured himself like that and felt that it would have been even worse than death.</p> <p> </p>",
  "Chapter 187: Large Electronics Factory": "<p>Two miles wasn’t a long distance in Lin Qiao’s eyes. This area was an industrial district, so many factories were to be found here, located close to each other. This allowed Lin Qiao and Xie Dong to move quickly forward by leaping across the roofs.</p> <p>In just a couple of minutes, Lin Qiao arrived at a large electronics factory that included five or six factory buildings, each having at least ten floors, and over twenty dorm buildings, each having seven stories.</p> <p>The factory sector was divided into a few parts, marked by letter A to D, and so was the dorm area.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood at the edge of a factory roof and looked down, finding a large number of zombies wandering down on the ground.</p> <p>She looked at the zombie crowd downstairs confusedly. She was sure that a level-four zombie was in this place; but normally, ordinary zombies wouldn’t appear in the territories of level-four zombies.</p> <p>So, what was happening here? Why did the level-four zombie let these ordinary zombies stay here? Why didn’t it drive them away?</p> <p>While Lin Qiao was observing the situation down on the ground, Xie Dong slowly climbed up from another side of the building. Seeing her leaning her head forward to look down, he wondered what she was looking at. So, he walked over, put his hands on the guardrail, and looked down as well.</p> <p>He soon understood what Lin Qiao had been observing as he also saw a lot of zombies.</p> <p>He raised his head to glance at the surrounding buildings, observing that all the zombies were outside and the buildings seemed to be empty. No wonder so many zombies were crowding down there.</p> <p>At the moment, they couldn’t even see the ground from the roof. At least three-thousand zombies were gathered down there, filling up all the available space. Lin Qiao guessed that those were just a fraction of the zombie group in this place, as this factory should have had at least thirty-thousand workers before the apocalypse.</p> <p>Xie Dong knocked at the guardrail. Hearing the noise, Lin Qiao turned to look at him and saw that he had pointed at the space between a few other buildings, then at the zombies down on the ground. After that, he talked to her with sign language.</p> <p>He was conveying that he didn’t see any zombie between the other buildings, so he guessed that all the zombies nearby were gathering around this building.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded in response; she had noticed that already.</p> <p>She was just curious about why the level-four zombie let so many ordinary zombies stay here. Level-four zombies shouldn’t be able to control ordinary zombies unless they possessed the spirit power, like the one she saw back in the South with Du Yuanxing and his team. For that matter, even a spirit-powered zombie couldn’t control so many ordinary zombies at one time.</p> <p>She turned to one direction, then pointed at a dorm building a few buildings away and talked to Xie Dong with sign language.</p> <p>She conveyed to him that a target was located in there, a zombie leader.</p> <p>Xie Dong was puzzled at first as he turned to look in that direction. He focused his sensations, but failed to detect any target. He then thought for a moment and figured that maybe the target had been hiding too well, so he wasn’t able to sense it.</p> <p>He turned to look at Lin Qiao and pointed in that direction while asking her with sign language if she had come here for that target.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at him, then looked down at the zombie crowd. After that, she raised her head and told Xie Dong with sign language that she would go find the level-four zombie first, and that he could do whatever he wanted.</p> <p>Then, she climbed onto the guardrail and leaped toward another building that was also a large factory building. It was about eight meters away, but Lin Qiao easily hopped on top of it.</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at that building and measured the distance with his eyes. He could only manage to reach a window of that building instead of directly hopping on top of it.</p> <p>After jumping over, Lin Qiao made a roll on the roof and then disappeared.</p> <p>The invisible Lin Qiao kept moving forward as she leaped across roofs and soon landed on top of the dorm building which she had marked earlier.</p> <p>The dorm building had seven floors, and it was where the workers used to live. Lin Qiao walked to the edge of the roof and leaned forward to look down at a corridor. She saw no zombies, but caught a strong scent of blood. She had sensed it earlier when she was with Xie Dong.</p> <p>It was so strong, so how could she not detect it?</p> <p>Nothing was down there, so she gripped the guardrail and flipped backward, nimbly swinging herself toward the corridor. She landed on the floor of the corridor quietly, then pressed her hat which had nearly fallen off just now.</p> <p>After that, she looked around and found that the place was as messy as most corners in the world. The wall was stained by dark blood, and the floor was covered in a thick layer of dust. She was invisible, yet she did leave footprints on the ground.</p> <p>She found the stairs and went to the lower floor.</p> <p>At the corner of the stairs, she saw large blood residues on the floors. Apparently, some bleeding bodies had been dragged up from the fifth floor.</p> <p>She followed the blood residues down, but avoided stepping on them.</p> <p>The blood scent on this floor was extra strong. Aside from it, Lin Qiao had also grasped the scents of human beings which she had sensed before near the bookstores. It appeared that those people were caught and eaten here. No wonder Lin Qiao only sensed them arriving, but couldn’t tell how they had left. Earlier on, she had found that the human scents were coming from the location of the level-four zombie.</p> <p>She saw a large puddle of fresh blood on the ground, looking vividly red. She could see colors now, so the red blood had given her quite a strong feeling. When the world was still black and white in her eyes, she would barely feel a thing at the sight of blood. But now, seeing the familiar red of blood along with sensing its scent, she felt less composed.</p> <p>Thankfully, she had gotten used to bloody scenes like this long ago. However, thinking of what she was about to see, she couldn’t help but have her face darkened.</p> <p>She followed the blood to the room at the end of the corridor. Except for the scent of fresh blood, she had also sensed an accumulated rotten smell.<br/>\nHer sharp sense of smell now made her a little comfortable, so she covered her nose with a hand.</p> <p>In fact, she found a few different layers of blood residues on the ground, each having a different color. The bottom one was brown, partially covered in fresh red blood.</p> <p>She moved closer to the room. Near the door, there was no clean spot on the ground for her to plant her foot. She had no choice but to avoid the fresh blood and step on the dried blood.</p> <p>Crack…!</p> <p>She heard a series of chewing and swallowing sounds from the room; the door was open. Hearing the voice, Lin Qiao could imagine the scene inside the room. She closed her eyes for a second, then walked in.</p>",
  "Chapter 188: Red Smoke Zombie": "<p>She walked to the door and looked inside. As she had thought, she saw a few broken furniture pieces and piles of human body parts, with the floor covered by a thick layer of dark-red blood.</p> <p>A figure was squatted in a corner with its back toward Lin Qiao, holding something with both hands and chewing on it.</p> <p>The chewing sound was coming out of its mouth.</p> <p>Its back was hunched, hair wet and sticky. Lin Qiao saw a part of that thing held in its hand, which turned out to be a human foot. Lin Qiao clearly saw the shank and the toes.</p> <p>Clearly, the zombie was eating the thigh area.</p> <p>Next to the zombie was a corpse which had been torn into two. It was a young man, his face covered in blood. His head appeared to have been bitten, as there was a hole in it.</p> <p>The young man’s eyes were opened wide, and so was his mouth. His face was twisted and eyes bulged, seeming to even fall out of the eye sockets. His body was torn apart from the waist, and his stomach was smashed, so Lin Qiao couldn’t see his internal organs clearly. His lower body was thrown to the side, and a leg of his was missing.</p> <p>Judging by the condition of this body, Lin Qiao figured that this man died less than forty-eight hours ago. The other body parts were older; it appeared that this zombie had sorted these corpses.</p> <p>The rotten pieces and bones were piled up in a corner by the door. That area radiated a strong stench, and was surrounded by hundreds of flies.</p> <p>This pile of body parts was at least a month old. Some pieces that were less than two weeks old were randomly scattered in the room, and the corpse next to the zombie was the freshest one.</p> <p>The zombie focused on its food, its head and body moving regularly. It had no idea that Lin Qiao was standing by the door.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a few seconds watching the zombie by the door, then took two small steps back to stand on a small, clean spot, and showed her face.</p> <p>Sensing Lin Qiao’s sudden appearance, the zombie froze. Then, it turned back abruptly, letting her see its weird-looking face. Like most zombies, its mouth was cracked from ear to ear. Its eyes were dark; its nose might have been bitten off by other zombies, as Lin Qiao only saw two holes on its face.</p> <p>“Roar!” At the sight of Lin Qiao, it bared its teeth and uttered a deep roar.<br/>\nIts voice delivered a firm intention of killing, as if saying that she must die in its hands for intruding in its territory.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed its hostility from its dark and cold eyes. As it was eating just now, its face and teeth were covered in blood. Lin Qiao even saw a few shreds of meat between its teeth.</p> <p>She rolled her eyes, ignoring the zombie’s roar as she crossed her arms and stepped back to lean against the guardrail of the corridor while looking at the zombie blandly. ‘Can you defeat me with your voice? Can you kill me by roaring?’</p> <p>The zombie was confused by Lin Qiao’s calm attitude. As she hadn’t shown a sign of attacking, the zombie couldn’t tell what encouraged her to come to its territory. Seeing her make no move, the zombie put down the human leg and stood up while turning.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t tell how it possibly looked back when it was still a human being. Its sticky hair weren’t long enough to cover its face; its face and body were entirely covered in blood. Its clothes had been soaked by blood over and over again, such that she couldn’t even recognize their original colors.</p> <p>It looked bloody and dirty, and smelled awful.</p> <p>This zombie had shown a strong hostility. Judging what she saw in this room, Lin Qiao figured that it had been hunting and eating human beings frequently.</p> <p>The man it was eating just now died less than forty-eight hours ago, but his scent had disappeared days ago. Lin Qiao guessed that he was caught and kept here by the zombie.</p> <p>This zombie even stored food and kept it alive. It was rather smart!</p> <p>The zombie faced Lin Qiao as it hunched its back and fixed its eyes on her, slowly releasing a faintly red smoke from its body. More and more red smoke was released, growing thicker and thicker, soon filling up half of the room.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had no idea what the red smoke could do. However, she was surprised to find that the zombie had the same kind of power as she did. Zombies with such kind of power were rarely seen. Lin Qiao had learned about many types of superpowers from Lu Tianyu’s memories, including metal, green, water, fire, earth, and the relatively rarer ones such as lightning power and spirit power.</p> <p>She had killed a level-five metal-powered zombie days ago, and back in the South, she had killed a spirit-powered one.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at this ugly zombie. If it hadn’t eaten too many people, she might have let it live for a little longer.</p> <p>As the red smoke slowly blurred the zombie’s body, Lin Qiao waved her hand. A thick stream of black mist was released, smartly surging toward the red smoke. The red smoke didn’t seem to be flexible or under the zombie’s control. It just spread in the room and mixed with the air.</p> <p>On the other hand, Lin Qiao’s black mist quickly flowed into the room, then spread to envelope the red smoke. The part of the red smoke touched by the black mist disappeared immediately, and the black mist quickly approached the zombie.</p> <p>“Roar!” Once Lin Qiao released the black mist, the zombie sensed the danger immediately. It nervously roared at Lin Qiao as it saw the black mist erase its red smoke and come at it.</p> <p>“Whooo…” The red smoke zombie growled with a deep voice while slowly drawing back. At the same time, Lin Qiao moved slightly and turned invisible. She saw two windows behind the zombie, and judging by its backward movement, it was preparing to run. Lin Qiao was aware of how powerful her black mist was, but didn’t expect the zombie to be so sensitive. It felt the danger before even touching the black mist, and smartly attempted to escape.</p> <p>Only the brainless zombies would charge at any enemy they saw without showing any fear. Unlike them, this zombie soon found out that it was no match for Lin Qiao, so it wisely chose to run.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao would give it no such chance.</p>",
  "Chapter 189: Sedative Gas": "<p>Once Lin Qiao disappeared, the red smoke zombie panicked. It immediately turned back and leaped out of the window. In the next second, an invisible figure followed it out.</p> <p>The zombie had exposed its weakness by trying to run.</p> <p>As soon as the zombie turned, Lin Qiao rushed into the room, swiftly darted through the red smoke, and stepped on the window frame, leaping out behind the red smoke zombie. She showed up right after that and swung her claws toward the red smoke zombie’s neck.</p> <p>The zombie was trying to leap onto another building. This building was facing another dorm building, such that one could see the corridors and room doors of that building from the window. The dorm buildings were no more than two meters away from each other, so it was able to jump into another building easily as a zombie.</p> <p>However, before it reached the other building, Ling Qiao gave it a neat claw attack from behind in the midair.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>The red smoke zombie hit the guardrail of a corridor of the other building, then fell to the ground in pieces.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>The zombie crowd down there didn’t make a big reaction to that. Lin Qiao released her vibe in the air, then landed on a zombie-free flower bed.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Her vibe stirred the zombie crowd, making all of them try to draw back. In less than ten seconds, a small clearing was created around her.</p> <p>She leaped down from the half-a-meter wide flower bed, then walked toward the red smoke zombie’s body which was cut into pieces by her. Seeing her move, the zombies near her moved away even more quickly.</p> <p>She walked to the dead red smoke zombie, whose head was cut off from its neck; its neck was connected with a shoulder and an arm, and its other shoulder and arm were also detached from its chest. Its body parts were scattered all over the ground.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to its head and squatted to cut open its head, then tore apart its skull and dug out its zombie nucleus. She had found something just now when she went through the red smoke.</p> <p>She sensed a refreshing sweet aroma from it, and felt like getting a bit lost in it.</p> <p>She had figured out what that feeling the red smoke gave her was: it was a sedative. She also found out that the red-smoke zombie was actually weak, because it didn’t even try to fight back before she cut it into pieces.</p> <p>Lin Qiao guessed that the red-smoke zombie kept those ordinary zombies around to defend itself. However, it didn’t think that Lin Qiao would come over from the roof while none of the ordinary zombies discovered her when she did.</p> <p>At that moment, Xie Dong walked to her side and lowered his head to look at her. Lin Qiao glanced at the zombie nucleus. Its energy was nothing special, so she threw it into the lake in her space. Then, she stood up and walked toward the outside, with Xie Dong following right behind her.</p> <p>She walked to a taller factory building that was about twenty meters away, then paused and turned back to give Xie Dong a hand signal. She told him to wait here while she went up to check for direction.</p> <p>Xie Dong glanced up at the roof, then nodded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to a line of air conditioner external units, then quickly climbed up, getting onto the roof in just ten seconds. After that, she hopped onto the highest spot and sniffed around at the air.</p> <p>Quite a while later, she finally grasped some scents.</p> <p>‘Eh?’</p> <p>She fixed her eyes in one direction, as she somehow felt that there was something in that area. However, as the distance was too huge, she couldn’t sense it clearly. She didn’t really catch any useful smells, because that area was too far away. But still, she had an indescribable feeling toward that area, and she didn’t know why.</p> <p>She sniffed in other directions but didn’t detect any other high-level zombies. Then, she glanced at the area which had given her a strange feeling and decided to head there first. The downtown area was in that direction anyway.</p> <p>She leaped down to the roof, then jumped down from the building. After two flips in the air, she stably landed on the ground. Xie Dong watched her come down, then walked over to her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her head to look at the sun. It was noontime, and she felt quite hot. While walking out of the factory area, she took off her coat, revealing her camouflage vest.</p> <p>She didn’t sweat, but felt hot. The sunlight might burn her skin if she exposed her arms and shoulders, but she would rather feel the wind than have her skin wrapped in clothes.</p> <p>Once she took off her coat, Xie Dong paused for a second and then stared straight at her. He was standing by her side, and on turning his head, he saw her…giant breasts! Her breasts were covered by the vest, yet the vest couldn’t hide their shape.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was going to wrap the coat around her waist and tie the sleeves together, but before that, she raised her head and saw that Xie Dong was gazing at her chest. So, she lowered her head to see her own body and realized that she had forgotten to try finding a suitable bra for herself!</p> <p>The vest she was wearing right now was tight, perfectly emphasizing the shape of her breasts and nipples…</p> <p>She silently put the coat on her shoulder, then tied the sleeves together. After that, she turned the sleeves to her back, and let the rest of the coat cover her chests.</p> <p>Finishing that, she found that Xie Dong was still eyeing her chest, so she kicked him. Xie Dong shambled two steps sideward, then came back to his senses.</p> <p>He felt embarrassed as he realized how weirdly he had just acted. He rubbed his nose, then looked at Lin Qiao’s face. She was wearing the sunglasses, so he couldn’t see her eyes.</p> <p>What he saw just now lingered in his head, the shape…the size…He really wanted to touch it!</p> <p>He spent some effort to stop himself from thinking about that, then gave Lin Qiao an awkward smile and a thumbs-up. Lin Qiao was pretty close to him, so she could surely sense his thoughts. As he gave her a thumbs-up while picturing rubbing her breasts, Lin Qiao silently raised a foot.</p> <p>Seeing that, Xie Dong immediately took a few steps away from her. Then, he discovered that the skin on Lin Qiao’s shoulders and arms was white and tender. It wasn’t ruddy and moisturized, but did have a beautiful luster, and looked quite smooth.</p> <p>Besides, her skin was nearly flawless.</p>",
  "Chapter 190: Follow the Feeling": "<p>Xie Dong had eyed Lin Qiao’s body, but didn’t dare to try touching it. He knew that if he did, she would undoubtedly kick his ass.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned and kept moving forward. All the surrounding zombies automatically moved away and cleared the road for her. She walked out of the factory gate, then let out the car. After that, she fully released her vibe and sat in the front seat.</p> <p>Xie Dong got in the driver’s seat and started the car, then turned to look at Lin Qiao. The latter raised a hand to point at the area which had given her a strange feeling, then waved her hand slightly forward.</p> <p>Xie Dong understood that she wanted him to drive there fast, so he nodded and pressed the accelerator. On the way, Lin Qiao had been directing him all the time, and an hour later, her expression finally changed a little.</p> <p>The factory area was near the West Lake District, and by now, they had crossed the entire West Lake District and entered the Upper City District. Both Upper City District and Down City District of Hang Zhou City were included in the city center, and had large populations.</p> <p>In this area, not only did Lin Qiao clearly sense some vibes, Xie Dong also felt quite a few strong vibes. His own vibe had been suppressed firmly here.</p> <p>He pulled over and then glanced at the large crowd of ordinary zombies before his car. Those zombies also looked at him and Lin Qiao, their broken zombie faces all showing a confused look.</p> <p>Xie Dong turned to Lin Qiao, who opened the car door and got off.<br/>\nOn her way here, she had restrained her vibe and made herself like an ordinary zombie. So, the road was jammed by ordinary zombies.</p> <p>When Xie Dong got off, Lin Qiao put the car into her space.</p> <p>At first sight, she saw at least a thousand zombies shambling in this area like old people. As Lin Qiao had restrained her vibe, these zombies didn’t avoid her. Xie Dong’s vibe had caught these zombies’ attention, yet it wasn’t strong enough to make them dodge.</p> <p>She looked around, then ran up to a building nearby, leaping up and nimbly climbing onto the roof like a monkey. Xie Dong learned from her movements and followed her up to the roof, even though he didn’t know what she was going to do.</p> <p>Climbing like that was many times faster than taking the stairs.</p> <p>The buildings in this area were all tall, and the one Lin Qiao climbed had over twenty stories. Standing on the roof, she was able to see things far away clearly.</p> <p>She walked to the edge of the roof to sniff the air for the scents of high-level zombies. Meanwhile, she tried to figure out their levels and how much they could suppress her.</p> <p>The distance had been shortened a lot, so she could sense them clearly now. From the area which had been making her feel strange, she sensed the scents of human beings…a group of human beings to be precise.</p> <p>‘Over ten living human beings there? And…they’re surrounded by a few level-five zombies…What’s going on there?’</p> <p>That area was near downtown, so it was crowded by countless zombies. None of those people was at a super-high level: two of them were at level five, and the other few were at level four or three. So, how did they manage to enter that area? And, why didn’t the three level-five zombies around them eat them?</p> <p>Lin Qiao focused her sensations on that area, but being about ten miles away, she wasn’t able to feel everything clearly. By that time, she only knew that those people were with the few zombie leaders.</p> <p>Why would those people stay with dangerous zombie leaders?</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t understand why. What she had sensed wasn’t normal in the post-apocalyptic era.</p> <p>Xie Dong climbed up as well. Seeing Lin Qiao fix her eyes in that direction, he walked over and looked down. The space between the buildings was filled with zombies, and more zombies were seen inside the buildings. He glanced at Lin Qiao and found that she was quietly gazing in that direction, seemingly lost in thoughts. However, he didn’t know what she had sensed, because he didn’t detect a thing from that area.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment, then decided to find those people right now to figure out what exactly was going on, because the strange feeling had been bothering her the whole time. While thinking, she signaled for Xie Dong to move stealthily, then pointed at the location of those people.</p> <p>After making that hand signal, she took a step backward and leaped toward the building in front of her. In midair, she suddenly disappeared, as though she had jumped into another dimension. In fact, even Xie Dong didn’t know how Lin Qiao did it. He felt that it was a fantastic skill, perfect for launching sneak attacks.</p> <p>He had witnessed Lin Qiao disappear and reappear in different places many times. However, he never noticed that she would actually become a transparent shred of shadow and keep moving even after her disappearance.</p> <p>Lin Qiao leaped onto that building, then moved forward as fast as she could. After that, she leaped onto the next building. Xie Dong was aware of the fact that he couldn’t move as fast as Lin Qiao did, neither could he see her now, as she had turned herself invisible. So, he had no choice but to move toward the direction given by Lin Qiao earlier.</p> <p>Lin Qiao swiftly leaped across the roofs. The buildings were at different heights, and the distances between them weren’t the same. However, she kept running and leaping without pausing. If the distance turned out to be too long, she would hop onto the treetops by the roadsides, then trample on the branches to move forward.</p> <p>The closer she got to those people, she uneasier she felt. She ignored the three level-five zombies, and was only eager to find out the truth about those people. The vibes of those human beings were strange to her, but that strange feeling forbade her from neglecting those people.</p> <p>In half an hour, Lin Qiao arrived at their location.</p> <p>It was so weird! From the roof of a tall building, Lin Qiao saw the group of people moving on the road, surrounded by many ordinary zombies. Those drooling zombies had their teeth bared, following these people slowly forward.</p> <p>They surrounded this group of people, but kept a distance of about two meters from them, not daring to come closer to them.</p> <p>This group of people obediently moved forward, because three higher level zombies had their eyes on them: one at the front, one at the back, and one at the side. The one at the front was clearly leading the way, and the one beside the group swung its arms from time to time, as if herding sheep. The one behind was keeping these people from escaping.</p> <p>Lin Qiao observed the three zombie leaders, whose original looks were unrecognizable. Lin Qiao couldn’t even tell if they used to be men or women, old or young. Their faces were all covered in blood. Their mouths were huge, sharp teeth bared, and black eyes bulged. Back in the old world, these three could have scared people right to death.</p>",
  "Chapter 191: Find The Group Of Human Beings": "<p>Lin Qiao took a few glances down, then moved a few meters forward and leaped off the roof. She hid among the zombie crowd, showing her face and moving toward the group of human beings.</p> <p>When she got close enough, she found that she actually knew the two at the front of this group of human beings. To be precise, it wasn’t ‘she’ who knew them, but Lu Tianyu.</p> <p>Looking at the two young men whose faces were covered in dust but still looked handsome, Lin Qiao murmured to herself, “What a coincidence. Does fate bring me to them?”</p> <p>One of the two young men was very familiar to Lu Tianyu: he was her younger brother. Lin Qiao had a vague impression about her brother from her memory. Her memory was messy, but on seeing the young man’s face, she still recalled him.</p> <p>They were half-siblings. Lu Tianyu believed that her stepmother tore apart her family, so she never liked her brother who was mothered by that woman. They never got along; after the apocalypse, she didn’t want to have anything to do with her brother.</p> <p>In the base, she always pretended not to know him.</p> <p>‘Lu Tianyi, why is he here?’ Lin Qiao wondered. ‘And these people…are they caught by zombies?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao followed the zombie crowd and moved forward along with Lu Tianyi and the others. She knew the young man beside Lu Tianyi as well. The young man’s name was Kong Qingming. He and Lu Tianyu were good friends, and he used to visit Lu Tianyi and his family, so Lu Tianyu knew him.</p> <p>‘Where are these three zombie leaders taking them?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao was sure that she could easily defeat a zombie leader now. Facing two zombie leaders…she believed that she could still win. If she needed to fight three of them, there would be no problem either.</p> <p>And that was because she had the black mist!</p> <p>She quietly released the black mist, controlling it with her mind. While splitting the mist into three streams and sending them into the three zombie leaders, she moved toward Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming.</p> <p>“Where are these zombies taking us?”</p> <p>“I don’t know…It’s weird…They didn’t eat us…”</p> <p>“You seem happy…They didn’t eat us now, but they’ll eat us later when they arrive at their destination. Hehe…We’re really unlucky this time…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao approached the group of human beings and heard Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingying talking with low voices. They had become two stunning-looking men. They had wounds and blood on their faces, along with dust and dirt; but still, Lin Qiao could tell how handsome they were.</p> <p>Hearing Kong Qingying’s words, Lu Tianyi immediately showed hatred in his eyes. Through clenched teeth, he said, “Damn it! If I can go back alive, I’ll definitely destroy Wu Yueyun. The dirty bastard drew these level-five zombies to us and then ran away!”</p> <p>Kong Qingming looked ahead while walking and responded with a tired voice, “Forget it…Do you think you can go back alive? You can dream about it before you die…” His eyes were lustreless and face expressionless. Every step he made forward made him feel that he was getting closer to death. But still, he didn’t understand why these zombies didn’t rush up to bite them, and made them walk instead.</p> <p>The hatred in Lu Tianyi’s eyes faded when he heard Kong Qingying’s words. Then, he lowered his head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was mingling in the zombie crowd at the moment. The other zombies were all dirty and messy, but she was pretty clean. Actually, she looked quite different from the other zombies, yet the zombies didn’t care.</p> <p>She wasn’t able to find out what the three level-five zombies were thinking, but could sense the thoughts of the ordinary ones around her.</p> <p>‘Food…can’t eat…’</p> <p>‘Leader…Food…’</p> <p>‘Food…for…Leader…’</p> <p>‘Food…can’t eat…eat…food…no…’</p> <p>The thoughts of ordinary zombies were simple, but from them, Lin Qiao had caught an important message.</p> <p>‘Leader? What does that mean? These three zombie leaders? Are they the dominators of this area? Is that why these ordinary zombies didn’t dare to eat their food?’</p> <p>‘That’s highly possible. Zombie leaders are like lion kings or wolf kings. They are higher-positioned than the others, and they have rules for the others to follow.’</p> <p>While thinking, Lin Qiao sent the black mist toward the three zombie leaders. The three had sharp sensations, which allowed them to sense the black mist when it was still about a meter away from them.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie leader behind the group uttered a roar, then stopped moving. Hearing his voice, the other zombies stopped as well, all looking around alertly.</p> <p>The three zombie leaders scanned around with their sharp eyes, then immediately spotted the black mist. As the black mist was approaching them, one of them swiftly waved a hand and raised a small-scale hurricane to dissipate it.</p> <p>With the black mist being blown away, Lin Qiao lost control of it. However, she soon found out that it didn’t disappear. It was thinned out, drifting toward the surrounding zombies and soon drilling and creating countless holes in their bodies.</p> <p>The ordinary zombies didn’t care about the holes in their bodies. Some of their limbs soon fell off, yet they had no feelings. But seeing that, the three zombie leaders immediately burst in screams.</p> <p>“Roarrrr-Whooo!”</p> <p>Their screams stirred the zombie crowd right away.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>“Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>As the ordinary zombies around her began darting and bumping against each other, Lin Qiao quickly turned herself invisible and moved closer to the group of human beings.</p> <p>Those ordinary zombies were agitated and began running about, but none of them got close to the three zombie leaders.</p> <p>The group of human beings was confused by this sudden twist. They looked at those blustering ordinary zombies, then at the three zombie leaders which had them surrounded, having absolutely no idea about what was happening.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao sneakily approached Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming. She wanted very much to kill the three zombie leaders now, but as the group of human beings were defenseless at the moment, she decided to pull them into her space one by one first.</p> <p>With some selfish motive, she went for Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming first.<br/>\nShe wasn’t like Lu Tianyu; she had younger brother and sister too. Maybe Lu Tianyu could probably watch Lu Tianyi die without saving him, but Lin Qiao couldn’t.</p> <p>Since she had run into this group of human beings, she would certainly save them.</p>",
  "Chapter 192: Three To Go": "<p>The three zombie leaders appeared to be different from the others level-five zombies. They not only gathered together peacefully without trying to tear each other into pieces, but had been working as a team!</p> <p>One of them stayed close to the group of human beings while the other two were looking around nervously and alertly. It seemed that if any enemy showed up, only the two would be fighting. The third one would stay with the group of human beings to prevent them from escaping or being saved.</p> <p>These zombies were almost as smart as human beings.</p> <p>The longer Lin Qiao observed, the smarter the three zombie leaders seemed. So, she concentrated herself.</p> <p>The invisible Lin Qiao walked up to Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming. Fortunately, they were standing by each other’s side. Lin Qiao reached out her hands and pressed on their shoulders.</p> <p>“Eh?” As they sensed something and turned their heads toward their shoulders which were touched by Lin Qiao, they saw a figure before their eyes and then their eyes were dazzled. After a blink, they found themselves in a different place.</p> <p>Seeing the lake, Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming were both stunned.</p> <p>“Qingming, are my eyes dazzled?”</p> <p>“I think it’s an…illusion?”</p> <p>“I was going to say the same. Do you think we’ll be back in where we were after a blink?”</p> <p>“We might…”</p> <p>Then, they turned their heads to look around confusedly.</p> <p>After pulling Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming into her space, Lin Qiao flashed out immediately, pressing her hands the two men who were behind the two boys, and then the three of them disappeared together.</p> <p>Lin Qiao moved swiftly and reacted fast. It was only by the time she had pulled the third batch of people into her space that the zombie who had been guarding the group of humans finally realized what was happening.</p> <p>“Roar!” It roared out and pounced on Lin Qiao when she showed up for the fourth time and reached her hands toward another two human beings.</p> <p>It was fast indeed, yet Lin Qiao was much faster. Before the zombie approached, she put her hands on the two people and then disappeared.</p> <p>In just a few seconds, she had thrown eight people into her space. After Viney had fixed her face and upgraded her strength, she was twice as fast than before. Therefore, none of the group of human beings or the zombie leader who was guarding them saw her face clearly.</p> <p>They only saw a dark-green figure flash across the air.</p> <p>After pulling the eight people into her space, Lin Qiao went back out and left them stunned.</p> <p>The zombie leader failed to touch Lin Qiao, so it gave another raging roar.</p> <p>“Roar!” It stood where Lin Qiao disappeared, quickly looking around for a few times. But no matter how it tried, it couldn’t find the dark-green figure.</p> <p>As it roared twice in a row, the other zombie leaders turned back and found that some of their preys had gone missing. They don’t know the exact number of their preys, but they were sure that some of them were missing.</p> <p>They were smart, but they couldn’t do math!</p> <p>Lin Qiao observed their reactions and found that all three of them were enraged. But still, they didn’t seem about to hurt the rest of human beings. Earlier on, she was worried that once she made a move, the three zombie leaders might get pissed off and decide to kill those people first.</p> <p>By now, she had saved more than half of those people, but the three zombies still showed no sign of hurting them, only gathering the rest of them and having them surrounded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the five human beings and sneakily moved toward them. She carefully stood between two zombies, then reached out a hand and grabbed a person’s cloth. After that, the person disappeared.</p> <p>She didn’t reach out both hands because she could have accidentally touched a zombie leader by doing that.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao stole another person away from them, the two zombie leaders near her reacted quickly. When she showed up, they immediately tried to claw her. But once again, they missed their targets.</p> <p>Lin Qiao threw that person into her space, then came right back out and grabbed another person, disappearing again. The two zombies hadn’t even finished their first attack by that time.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar!” As their preys kept disappearing, the three zombie leaders were infuriated. They started a hurricane, then raised a raging fire. The wind and fire mixed together, soon creating a fiery tornado that surrounded the three zombies and the last three people.</p> <p>The fiery tornado looked awesomely cool, such that Lin Qiao couldn’t help but even want to give it a thumbs-up. But in the next second, she began worrying.</p> <p>The three people in the tornado had started to yell for help. For now, she couldn’t save them with the old method.</p> <p>“Help! Don’t…Don’t leave us behind! Hero! Help us!”</p> <p>“Help me! I’m still here! I’m still here! Save me too!”</p> <p>“Please! Please don’t leave the three of us behind!”</p> <p>They saw their friends disappear along with a shred of shadow, so the three of them figured that someone had come to save them. However, before that mysterious figure could save them, the three zombie leaders had stopped it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the three people in the tornado, then looked around.</p> <p>Because the three zombie leaders were boiling with anger, the zombie crowd was gone. Clearly, those ordinary zombies were scared away, fleeing to the alley nearby.</p> <p>As a result, this area had become empty.</p> <p>‘They ran pretty fast,’ Lin Qiao thought as she looked around and found that Xie Dong was standing behind a wall a short distance away, looking at her.<br/>\nShe immediately made a hand gesture to signal for him to stay put and not move.</p> <p>Then, she turned back and walked toward the fiery tornado. She made a circle around it but found no way in. Even though she was invisible, she could still be burned if she directly went through the fire.</p> <p>After that, she glanced at the buildings nearby. The buildings weren’t higher than the flame, so she couldn’t jump into the center of the tornado from the roofs.</p> <p>The three people spent a while yelling, then turned hopeless. They knew that no one could save them without killing the three zombie leaders.</p> <p>Who was powerful enough to kill three zombie leaders at one time? Even a level-six superpowered human being couldn’t guarantee to win against a zombie leader. Only if the mysterious figure who saved their friends was a level-seven base leader, they might still have a chance to live.</p> <p>However, they didn’t think that that kind of thing could happen. The Sea City Base had only three leaders, and important men like them wouldn’t possibly come here just to save a few nobodies.</p>",
  "Chapter 193: The Zombies Were Scared Away": "<p>The people in Lin Qiao’s space were silently looking at each other at the moment, as they hadn’t figured out what was happening! A man who reacted relatively faster saw Lu Tianyi by his side and asked immediately, “Captain! Is this an independent space?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi glanced at the lake, then at the grassland and those neatly placed fancy furniture pieces, and…the stove nearby. He and Kong Qingming got here first, and both of them had carefully observed the space twice. Hearing his teammate’s question, he responded with hesitation, “I think…so. But, did you see the one who brought you in?”</p> <p>The others shook their heads, but Kong Qingming said, “He’s way too fast. I only saw a dark green shadow at first. When he came in again with the others, I saw that he was wearing camouflage.”</p> <p>The others all turned to him.</p> <p>“How did he manage to quietly send us here? The few zombie leaders barely reacted. How did he do that?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming glanced at each other, then the latter said, “We want to know that too.” Then, he counted his teammates and continued, “Three of us are still out there.”</p> <p>Reminded by him, the others looked around and confirmed that only ten people were in the space.</p> <p>One of the two who came in the last said, “I don’t think the owner of this space can save the three of them, because the three zombie leaders got nervous before we came in. They might have been stimulated when the two of us disappeared right in front of their eyes. I guess they’ve already launched some massive attacks by now.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi had his eyes fixed on the lake for a while, then he turned to look at the grass. Suddenly, he gave a start as though he had seen something strange. Then, he turned to walk toward the grassland.</p> <p>As he moved, the others followed him.</p> <p>After getting close, Lu Tianyi confirmed what he had seen.</p> <p>“Are these…mutant strawberries? Eh…broccoli? Lettuce?”</p> <p>“Look, large pumpkins! They’re all mutants, aren’t they!”</p> <p>“And potatoes, a pile of them! What are these for? They’re all mutant!”</p> <p>Looking at the thriving strawberry plants and vegetables, and those barely touched pumpkins and potatoes, the group of people was utterly confused.</p> <p>At that moment, a tiny gray figure leaped out of the strawberry field, then jumped into the grasses and disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>“Em…if I’m right, that should be a rabbit!”</p> <p>“You’re right, I saw it too!”</p> <p>The group of people watched the rabbit disappear in the grasses and just stood by the strawberry plants, stunned.</p> <p>On the outside, Lin Qiao stood five meters away from the fiery tornado. She felt hot near the fire, so she had no choice but to keep a distance from it. It seemed that the three zombie leaders weren’t going to kill the three people. Lin Qiao thought for a moment, then showed her face.</p> <p>“Roar!” The moment she showed up, the three zombies roared out loud at her as one of them sprung out of the fire and charged at her.</p> <p>She looked at the zombie which had its whole body wrapped in flames; it wasn’t that fast in her eyes. She calmly stood still, and when the zombie nearly touched her, she moved suddenly to its side and raised a claw to attack it.</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>The fire zombie didn’t expect Lin Qiao to be able to easily dodge its attack, because it hadn’t sensed any threatening vibe from her. Before the zombie could turn back, Lin Qiao’s claw landed on its back.</p> <p>She didn’t stop there, but crooked her fingers and pulled her hands back. Then, her sharp claws cut into the zombie’s body.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>After one collision, the fire zombie thudded against the ground and its fire died off. Lin Qiao still didn’t stop; instead, she conveniently raised a hand and released a thick stream of black mist, which was no longer manifesting in mere thin wisps.</p> <p>The dark mist descended on the zombie’s body on the ground, then wrapped it up. In the next moment, the zombie’s body was gone without a trace, and only its head remained there.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao waved her hand toward the fiery tornado, following which, the black mist rolled it way.</p> <p>After the fire zombie died, the flame in the tornado faded away gradually as well. Soon, only the wind was left spinning.</p> <p>As the black mist gushed out of Lin Qiao’s palm, the other two zombie leaders who were guarding the three human beings showed fear for the first time. They bent lower and lower, and their roars slowly turned into deep growls.</p> <p>As the fire was gone, Lin Qiao approached them along with the black mist. The two zombie leaders’ voices contained a message of retreating. However, Lin Qiao still maintained seventy percent of vigilance toward them. She felt that the two zombies were preparing to give up on their preys and run. Hence, she decided to let them run, but still needed to prevent them from killing the three people before running.</p> <p>She strengthened the black mist that swallowed everything within the area within a radius of ten meters. The asphalt road, the stones on the ground, the broken vehicles, the plants, the streetlights…everything in the surrounding was quickly devoured by the black mist.</p> <p>The black mist was, in fact, an embodiment of energy. When Lin Qiao closed her eyes, she could see the mist in a purple color and with a weird luster. But with her physical eyes open, she only saw the thick blackness of it.</p> <p>She controlled the black mist by controlling the energy in it. The black mist spread slowly, going down toward the tornado created by the two zombies. As the cloud of mist which was turning huger and huger, thicker and thicker while pressing down, the two zombies finally howled and turned to run.</p> <p>“Em…They, ran?” Watching one of the three fierce zombies being killed within a blink and the other two scared way, the three people who were suddenly saved from the hopeless situation looked at each other, all dumbfounded.</p> <p>As the two ran away, Lin Qiao composedly took back the black mist. Earlier on when she released the mist, she had sensed that the two zombies were afraid. That was why she only sent the black mist slowly toward them to give them a greater pressure with the slow motion of the mist.</p> <p>The result was obvious. The two zombies were only as smart as six or seven years old children. Facing something that was life-threatening, they would easily get scared and run.</p> <p>For that reason, Lin Qiao expanded the black mist and sent it slowly toward the zombies. At last, the two zombies couldn’t stand the pressure anymore, leaving their preys to run.</p>",
  "Chapter 194: We Owe You A Life": "<p>After Lin Qiao retrieved the black mist, the area was found to have turned into a clearing. The area swept across by the black mist had nothing left in it: the vehicles, stones, and plants were all gone, and a layer of the ground was missing as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the three men who were stunned at the moment, then looked around. After that, she gave Xie Dong, who was hiding in a corner, a hand gesture to tell him that it was safe, and signaled for him to come out.</p> <p>Seeing that, Xie Dong came out and walked over to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Eh, isn’t that Xie Dong from Block C? I think he had gone missing for long!” One of the three men recognized Xie Dong.</p> <p>Xie Dong’s ears moved slightly, so he glanced at the three while walking up to Lin Qiao and recognized one of them. They had carried a mission together, but then they never reached out to each other again, because they didn’t live in the same area of the base.</p> <p>That man’s name was Huang Shou. He was twenty-five years old, level-three with earth power. But by now, his energy should have run out.</p> <p>Xie Dong lived in Block C, which was located in the outskirts of the Sea City Base, while Huang Shou lived in Block A.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Xie Dong walked to the three men, then quickly looked at them from head to toe. The three looked back at her with gratitude, then found out that Lin Qiao was a female.</p> <p>She was wearing a hat and a pair of sunglasses. Her waist was slim, arms slender and snow-white. She had a camouflage coat wrapped on her shoulders that covered her chest, but it couldn’t hide the shape of her breasts. Her lower body was wearing loose-fitting camouflage trousers and a pair of combat boots.</p> <p>She was in a military outfit, but wasn’t carrying any weapons.</p> <p>The three guessed that she was a really mighty being, because except for heavy weapons, no regular weapons could possibly defeat the three zombie leaders.</p> <p>Huang Shou soon turned his eyes from Lin Qiao to Xie Dong, then said with a slight excitement, “It’s you, Xie Dong! What a surprise! Why are you here in this zombie city? And this is?”</p> <p>He pointed at Lin Qiao and asked. He understood that Xie Dong and Lin Qiao weren’t here to save them. They had just passed by and conveniently lent a hand.</p> <p>Xie Dong nodded at Huang Shou, then pointed at his own throat and waved a hand. Huang Shou looked at him and asked with confusion, “What happened to your throat? Can’t you talk?”</p> <p>Xie Dong shook his head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned and walked to the zombie head on the ground. She then squatted and released a wisp of black mist that coiled around it. The black mist wrapped around the zombie head and soon devoured it, leaving behind a sparkling zombie nucleus.</p> <p>After greeting Xie Dong, Huang Shou instantly walked toward her. Then, he glanced at Lin Qiao and asked, “Who is she? Her black mist seems to be powerful…Even two zombie leaders were scared away by it. I think she’s no lower than level-six, right? I don’t remember seeing her in our base. Where is she from?”</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at him, then took out a small notebook and a pen from his pocket, writing down a sentence to show him.</p> <p>‘Ask her yourself.’</p> <p>The three didn’t know that Lin Qiao was a zombie, and Xie Dong wouldn’t tell them about that. But, how should he introduce her? Xie Dong had no idea about that, so he told Huang Shou to ask her himself.</p> <p>“Ask her myself? So mysterious! Ah, where did she take our Captain and the others?” Reading Xie Dong’s note, Huang Shou paused slightly, then suddenly remembered that his other teammates were missing.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao had picked up the zombie nucleus and disappeared from where she was.</p> <p>Huang Shou was considering how to greet Lin Qiao, but before he did it, she disappeared. Then, he thought of something else, so he hurriedly turned to Xie Dong and said, “She…disappeared! We didn’t see her when she saved our friends, who had also disappeared. How did that happen? Does she have a space?”</p> <p>Xie Dong nodded at him, remaining silent.</p> <p>At that point, three figures showed up where Lin Qiao had vanished just now, then one of them disappeared again. Seeing the two who had suddenly shown up, Huang Shou burst in delighted yells, “Captain! Deputy Captain!”</p> <p>Then, the three immediately walked to Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming who were just brought out by Lin Qiao, and hadn’t realized what had happened yet.</p> <p>“Ah! Thank god, you’re okay!” Seeing that Huang Shou and the other two were still alive, Lu Tianyi was delighted as well. Huang Shou nodded at him, then took a deep breath as he blinked and said, “I almost thought that you were gonna die here!” He sounded like a survivor of a disaster.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi sighed with relief and said, “As long as everyone is okay…”</p> <p>Meanwhile, two more people were brought out of the space by Lin Qiao.<br/>\nLu Tianyi turned to look at them and saw a slim dark-green figure bring the two people out, then disappear in the next second. She was too fast, so he didn’t manage to see her face.</p> <p>As more of their teammates were sent out, Huang Shou stopped talking. He, Lu Tianyi, and Kong Qingming watched Lin Qiao bring out the rest of the team.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had to enter her space three times to bring out all the people in there. At last, she flashed across the air and showed up in front of Lu Tianyi, looking at him from two meters away.</p> <p>Only until now did Lu Tianyi see Lin Qiao clearly. Soon, he knitted his brows and silently fixed his eyes on her face.</p> <p>Xie Dong quietly stood behind Lin Qiao. Seeing the look on Lu Tianyi’s face, he guessed that he might have recognized Lu Tianyu’s face, but wasn’t quite sure, or couldn’t believe it.</p> <p>“Oi, we’re out! Where’re the three zombie leaders?”</p> <p>“Eh? This is where we were just now, right? What happened to the ground?”</p> <p>“Boss…”</p> <p>The others who were dragged out of the space by Lin Qiao quickly realized what had happened. They looked around alertly to confirm their safety, and only after that did they sigh with relief.</p> <p>Then, they all saw Lin Qiao and Xie Dong.</p> <p>Huang Shou put his mouth near Kong Qingming’s ear and asked with a low voice, “Deputy Captain, it’s her who saved us. Did you enter her space just now?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming nodded at him, then glanced at Lu Tianyi and remained silent. The others had all noticed that Lu Tianyi was staring at Lin Qiao frowningly, and felt that it wasn’t so appropriate. After all, she had just saved them from the zombies.</p> <p>At that point, Lu Tianyi suddenly wore a grateful smile and said to Lin Qiao, “You saved us…Every member of my team owes you a life! Please let us know whenever you need our help. I am Lu Tianyi, the Captain of Class Three, Agriculture Department, Sea City Base. May I ask your name?”</p> <p>“Yeah, we all owe you a life! We’ll definitely pay you back with it if you ever need us!” Hearing Lu Tianyi’s words, the others agreed immediately.</p>",
  "Chapter 195: A Double-Powered Being": "<p>Lin Qiao quietly looked at Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming, her eyes containing a calm look. She could sense their sincere gratitude, as well as their confusion.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then slightly raised her head and showed her face. As she expected, once she exposed her face, the looks on Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming’ faces changed. Unlike them, however, the others made no reaction.</p> <p>The smile in Lu Tianyi’s face froze, then disappeared. He widened his eyes while his pupils shrank. He pointed at Lin Qiao and opened his mouth slightly, but didn’t make any sound.</p> <p>Seeing his reaction, the others were all bewildered.</p> <p>“Boss, what’s wrong? Do you know this…pretty lady?”</p> <p>Huang Shou glanced at Lin Qiao’s face, seeing her delicate chin and beautifully shaped lips, and figured that she was a pretty lady. He really wanted to see her eyes.</p> <p>At that moment, Kong Qingming raised a hand to press Lu Tianyi’s arm down, then whispered in his ear, “Calm down! Maybe she just looks like her.”</p> <p>Watching Kong Qingming’s movements, Huang Shou and the others were even more confused. Lu Tianyi breathed deeply to calm himself, then nodded.</p> <p>“Don’t you forget that she didn’t have any powers,” Kong Qingming took his hand away and reminded Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>“I know,” Lu Tianyi nodded, then closed his eyes. When he reopened those eyes, he had already calmed down. However, despite what Kong Qingming said, he believed that he was right. He was so familiar with that face that he could recognize it at first sight, with or without makeup. The hat and the sunglasses couldn’t hide it at all.</p> <p>However, Kong Qingming was not wrong either. That woman didn’t have any superpowers, while this one in front of him had a space. That woman wouldn’t save him, neither would she come all the way to such a dangerous zombie city. And this one who was standing before his eyes saved him just conveniently.</p> <p>She wasn’t her! But, they grew up together, so how could he have possibly mistaken her for somebody else?</p> <p>Lu Tianyi had no idea that because of his mood swings, Lin Qiao was actually able to sense his thoughts right now.</p> <p>Kong Qingming was his best friend for years, so without question, he knew how he was feeling and thinking at the moment. He sighed, but didn’t say anything, only looking at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>At this moment, Huang Shou abruptly began talking, “That…Sister! Since you won’t tell us your name, I think I’m gonna call you sister. I have one question, but I don’t know if I can ask.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Huang Shou’s twenty-year-old face and felt that it was appropriate for him to call her sister. So, she nodded. Then, Lu Tianyi, Kong Qingming, and all the others turned their eyes to Huang Shou.</p> <p>Huang Shou swallowed his saliva and asked carefully, “Are you a…double-powered being?”</p> <p>Hearing that, the group of human beings immediately changed their expressions and fixed their eyes on Lin Qiao. Lu Tianyi gave a start first, then stared straight at her. It seemed that these people would keep eyeing her until she gave them an answer.</p> <p>Except for Huang Shou and the other two, the rest of the team hadn’t seen her use the black mist. So, when Huang Shou asked that question, they were all shocked.</p> <p>After all, double-powered beings were extremely rare, and consequently legendary in the post-apocalyptic world. Over a million people were living in the Sea City Base, but among them, only one was double-powered. That person had two different types of natural powers.</p> <p>He was an elderly man. After the apocalypse, his water power and green power had revived his body to a certain degree. Therefore, even though he was in his seventies, he looked no different from the ones in their fifties.</p> <p>That was a normal thing. Almost all superpowered human beings were healthier and stronger than the ordinary ones, and aged much slower. Therefore, the superpowered human beings had gained new vibes and skills since the apocalypse, but their appearances had barely changed.</p> <p>All Sea City people were aware of how important that double-powered man was. He didn’t like the game of thrones, or there would be another leader in the base.</p> <p>He was at level-six, but he was no weaker than the three level-seven base leaders.</p> <p>That wasn’t the point. The point was that the number of double-powered people was a very small figure; only one of them existed in the Sea City Base. However, this group of human beings had heard that quite some double-powered people lived in the Huaxia Base. After all, Huaxia was a super base, which was more powerful than the Sea City Base by at least three times.</p> <p>Seeing the group of people’s glowing eyes, Lin Qiao rolled her eyes. She wondered how Huang Shou’s brain was working that made him ask such a dumb question after witnessing her using two powers.</p> <p>But before she responded, Xie Dong wrote a few words on the notebook, then tore off the piece of paper and wadded it up, throwing it at Huang Shou’s forehead.</p> <p>“Ah! It hurts!” Huang Shou wanted to dodge, but failed. While shouting in pain, he fumbled to catch the little wad of paper. Then, he unwrapped it and read Xie Dong’s note—’Silly, what you just saw wasn’t an illusion.’</p> <p>“Oh!” After reading the note, Huang Shou remembered that he had indeed seen Lin Qiao use two types of powers just now. That was right, she was double-powered!</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at this group of human beings. They all looked in a mess and with exhausted energies, but none of them had serious injuries, only some small wounds.</p> <p>Lin Qiao estimated that these people wouldn’t have a chance out of this zombie city without her. However, following her to the central area which had more higher-level zombies was also dangerous for them.</p> <p>In this case, she had no choice but to let these people stay in her space for a few days. When she had finished exploring this city, she would send them back to the Sea City Base.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then took out the clipboard and began writing. Seeing her writing, Lu Tianyi and the others were stunned again. They looked at Lin Qiao with confusion, then glanced around.</p> <p>‘Why write? Couldn’t she talk? ‘</p> <p>Xie Dong wrote on a small notebook, and now she was writing on a clipboard. It appeared that it was really not convenient for these two to talk.</p> <p>While they were trying to figure out something, Lin Qiao finished writing, raised the clipboard, and waved her hand toward them. The group of people walked to her and saw the text written there—’I don’t have time to send you out of the city now. You should just rest in my space for a couple of days.’</p> <p>She wanted them to know that she still had something else to do, so she couldn’t escort them out of the city immediately. These people needed to wait for a few days. Otherwise, based on their current condition, they might not be able to leave this zombie city without getting hurt or killed, even if she gave them a bunch of weapons.</p>",
  "Chapter 196: I’ll Show You After You Eat": "<p>“It’s indeed impossible for us to get out of this Upper City District through hundreds of thousands of zombies now,” said Kong Qingming. He looked around and found that the area had been empty all this while, wondering why no more zombies showed up. The three zombie leaders had left, so the other zombies should have been attracted to here by their scents soon.</p> <p>But they had stood here for two or three minutes, yet the surrounding area was still quiet.</p> <p>It was weird.</p> <p>“Yeah,” Huang Shou agreed, “we don’t have any superpower energy or weapons. Our strength is down by seventy percent.”</p> <p>However, Lu Tianyi said, “No, we can stay outside for now. If we have guns, we can still deal with ordinary zombies. Besides, our powers will recover slowly. We just need some time.” In fact, he didn’t want to stay in that space. Once he saw her face, he didn’t want himself to be protected by her. At least, he didn’t want to enter her space, because that would make him feel that he was too useless.</p> <p>Besides, if he stayed in that space, he wouldn’t have enough opportunities to spend time with her. He wanted to figure out who she was.</p> <p>He wanted to know if she was really Lu Tianyu or not!</p> <p>Kong Qingming glanced at him, staying silent while the others looked at each other. Since their boss had said so, they decided to stay outside with him as well.</p> <p>“But, where can we find guns now?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at them, then abruptly squatted and waved a hand. After a series of clings and clings, a line of guns appeared on the ground: pistols, rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles…All kinds of guns just appeared before their eyes.</p> <p>After letting out those guns, Lin Qiao stood up and took two steps backward, then faced Lu Tianyi and pointed at those guns.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming glanced at each other, remaining silent.</p> <p>“Whoa! Are these for us!” Seeing those guns, the others popped their eyes in shock. With these weapons, their strength would rise by fifty percent! That meant their lives would be safer by fifty percent!</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood there quietly, but in her head, she couldn’t help but complain, I’ve taken them out, so there’re surely for you. Or what? Should I set a stand here and sell them?’</p> <p>Lu Tianyi slowly walked over, standing in front of Lin Qiao as he stared at her. At last, he couldn’t help but ask, “Can I see your eyes.”</p> <p>His teammates had squatted impatiently, prepared to touch those guns. But on hearing his question, they all raised their heads to look at them, then turned to Lin Qiao. Looking from down here, her chin was even prettier.</p> <p>They glanced at each other, then showed a meaningful smile in their eyes while glancing at Lu Tianyi with surprise.</p> <p>Did their boss have a crush on her? It was understandable. Not many women lived in the base, and even fewer of them would come out to hunt zombies. Facing such a powerful and mysterious woman, anyone would want to see her eyes.</p> <p>They wanted to see her eyes as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave a faint smile. She was surprised that Lu Tianyi remembered Lu Tianyu so clearly. ‘I thought they hated each other,’ she said to herself silently. ‘Does he care about her because he hates her?’</p> <p>‘Yeah, I can show you my eyes,’ she thought. ‘But, you better don’t regret.’</p> <p>Both Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming noticed Lin Qiao’s weird smile, and had a not-so-good feeling. All of a sudden, Lin Qiao made a step forward, then grabbed their hands and brought them into her space.</p> <p>“Boss!” Seeing their two bosses disappear again, the others were startled at first, but then calmed back down. Their boss wanted to see the pretty lady’s eyes, but the lady didn’t seem to want to show her eyes to the others. So, these people guessed that Lin Qiao brought the two of them into her space because she wanted to show her eyes only to them.</p> <p>But, why wouldn’t she show her eyes to the rest of them? She was pretty, so why didn’t she want the others to see her eyes? Was something wrong with her eyes? Was that the reason why she didn’t want too many people to see them?</p> <p>Huang Shou picked up a rifle. While checking the bullets, he walked to Xi Dong and asked, “Is that woman your boss? Is she pretty? Are you with her now? But, where are your teammates? Huang Xiao?”</p> <p>Xie Dong took out the small notebook and wrote to respond, ‘They’re dead. I don’t have a team anymore.’</p> <p>“Ah…eh? Is that so?” That really wasn’t good news, so Huang Shou glanced at Xie Dong embarrassedly.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After bringing the two into her space, Lin Qiao stood in front of them. She didn’t immediately take off her sunglasses, but turned and walked to the strawberry plants and picked a few strawberries. Then, she walked to the stove and fetched some water with a water scoop from a bucket, and soaked the strawberries in it.</p> <p>She cleaned the strawberries, then handed them to the two.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming watched her picking the strawberries and washing them, not knowing what she was trying to do. The strawberries were mutant, so they didn’t think that Lin Qiao would eat them, neither could they guess that she washed those for them to eat.</p> <p>“What…does this mean? You don’t want us to eat these, do you?” Lu Tianyi looked at Lin Qiao confusedly. The two didn’t even want to touch those strawberries because they were mutated.</p> <p>Lin Qiao reached out a hand to pull Lu Tianyi’s hand, then thrust the strawberries in his hand. After that, she took one strawberry back, put into her own mouth, and took a bite.</p> <p>Then, she found out that she actually tasted a sourness. The strawberry wasn’t as flavorless as before.</p> <p>‘Eh?’</p> <p>She paused slightly, then chewed the strawberry and swallowed it. After that, she clicked her tongue and confirmed that there was indeed a sour flavor lingering in her mouth.</p> <p>Watching her take a large bite of the strawberry, Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming were both dumbfounded.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao looked at them and said, “Eat…not…poisonous…”</p> <p>Hearing her speak so slowly, Lu Tianyi immediately stared at her with a bewildered look and asked, “What happened to your voice? Can’t you even talk normally now?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s voice was dry and hoarse, sounding like something produced by damaged vocal cords. It was nothing like Lu Tianyu’s voice.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took another bite of the strawberry, then said, “Eat…or…not? I’ll…show…you…after…you…eat…”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi watched her finish the whole strawberry and listened to her slow speech. “You…” he said, feeling very strange.</p> <p>Earlier on, he was sure that Lin Qiao was Lu Tianyu. But now, he had started doubting himself again. He doubted because Lu Tianyu never talked to him so peacefully, not to mention telling him to eat anything. Was she trying to poison him now? But, she ate a strawberry herself, and nothing seemed to happen to her.</p>",
  "Chapter 197: Confirmed Identity": "<p>Seeing that Lu Tianyi’s reaction had become slower than usual, Kong Qingming said to Lin Qiao for him, “Are you sure? These are mutant. You’re not going to murder your brother and I, are you? You never cared about him anyway, isn’t that right?” He frankly pointed out the relationship between Lu Tianyi and the former owner of Lin Qiao’s body. Lin Qiao smiled, then turned to walk to the chair beside the stove, sitting down on it.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming clearly detected scorn from her smile.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat down, then slightly raised her head, looking at them as she said, “…Dare?”</p> <p>It was just one word, but the two found it provocative. Lin Qiao doubted that they didn’t have the guts to eat those strawberries.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi picked up the strawberry and put it near his eyes to look closely. He found it to be extra large, and having a strange color. But, as he sniffed at it, he sensed a strong and refreshing aroma.</p> <p>He had no idea that he wouldn’t be able to sense this refreshing aroma and only a pungent stink if these strawberries weren’t planted in Lin Qiao’s space and watered by the lake water.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi glanced at Lin Qiao, then said, “In fact, you’ve admitted it. Whether I eat these or not, or whether you show me your eyes or not, that’s not important anymore. But you now look…”</p> <p>He wanted to say that she looked thoroughly different than before.</p> <p>He glanced at Lin Qiao with a complicated look, then put the strawberry into her mouth and quickly took a bite.</p> <p>“Oi! Even if you want to die, you don’t have to do it this way!” Kong Qingming was startled. He still wasn’t sure if the strawberry was poisonous or not. It had mutated, so it must be carrying the zombie virus.</p> <p>Seeing that Lu Tianyi had bit the strawberry, Kong Qingming hurriedly reached out a hand to squeeze his chin. Lu Tianyi stepped backward to dodge his hand, then covered his face with another arm and chewed the strawberry.</p> <p>In fact, he knew that if she wanted to hurt them, she wouldn’t have to save them. Why would she save them then poison them? What would the point be?</p> <p>So, he chose to believe her. Actually, he wanted more to find out what had happened to her. He wanted to know why her voice changed, and why it seemed that her throat was broken.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi quickly swallowed the strawberry in his mouth, not even having the time to taste it. After that, he said to Kong Qingming, “Don’t worry! She has no reason to hurt us.”</p> <p>Then, he turned to Lin Qiao and asked, “If I finished these mutant strawberries, can you tell me what happened to you after you…did that thing to…that man?”</p> <p>By ‘that thing’, he was surely talking about raping the base leader. He couldn’t bear to say that out loud. Even though everyone had known about that, for some reason, he just felt too embarrassed to say it in front of her.</p> <p>He had such a weird feeling at the moment. The person in front of him used to be familiar to him, but now, he felt that she was a total stranger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and stayed silent.</p> <p>After Lu Tianyi recognized her, his attitude toward her was better than she expected. Judging by his reaction, he was not only surprised, but also delighted and worried. His complicated feelings didn’t include hatred or other negative elements.</p> <p>Now, he wanted to see her eyes and know what happened to her voice. He also wanted to know what had happened to her after she did that bad thing.</p> <p>Wasn’t he simply concerned about her?</p> <p>And, Lin Qiao was surprised to find that the strange feeling she had been having since she was at a long distance away was actually from Lu Tianyi. Why did that happen? Was it because of the blood ties between them?</p> <p>But, she had become a zombie already, so what did it have to do with blood ties?</p> <p>As Lin Qiao nodded, Lu Tianyi continued eating strawberries. As he took another bite, he discovered something that he didn’t notice earlier. “Eh? It’s quite sweet! It’s sweet, and a little bit sour. It tastes not bad!” Lu Tianyi paused slightly, then said. After that, he handed a strawberry to Kong Qingming and continued, “Try it! If you don’t eat it, she won’t let you out anyway.” While speaking, he glanced at Lin Qiao. Meanwhile, Kong Qingming was a little speechless.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spread her hands to Kong Qingming and responded with, “He…said…that…”</p> <p>It had nothing to do with her, because she didn’t say that.</p> <p>Kong Qingming turned back to glance at Lu Tianyi. ‘So, you wanna get me killed too? You’re really my good brother!’ He complained silently.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi had already started eating his second strawberry. In fact, he and his teammates had been starving for two days. After the first bite, he began eating the rest of the strawberries carelessly. He wondered if the woman gave them these strawberries because she knew that they were really hungry.</p> <p>“Alright, I’ve eaten what you want me to eat. Can you take off your sunglasses now?” For some reason, he cared about her sunglasses a lot. Lu Tianyu would never hide her beautiful eyes behind sunglasses.</p> <p>“Don’t…regret…” said Lin Qiao blandly.</p> <p>“What can I possibly regret for?” Lu Tianyi asked confusedly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then slightly lowered her head, took off her sunglasses, and raised her head.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming saw that she raised her head, and then, they saw a pair of purely black eyes. The eyeballs were entirely black, and were sparkling dimly. In this poorly illuminated space, those eyes looked really weird.</p> <p>Both of them automatically stepped back as they popped their eyes to look at her with shock. Those weren’t the eyes of human beings, but belonged to high-level zombies. They had just seen some eyes like that.</p> <p>“Your eyes! You…” Lu Tianyi stared at Lin Qiao and said with disbelief. However, he couldn’t even manage to let out a full sentence. At that moment, Lin Qiao suddenly stood up and stared at them with her weird-looking, black eyes, approaching them step by step.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao came closer, Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming continued stepping backward. Being stared by a pair of eyes like that, they really couldn’t remain calm. Once Lin Qiao made a step forward, they would make one backward.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took a few steps, then stopped and gave them a faint smile, putting the sunglasses back on.</p> <p>‘Boys, now you’re afraid? You did keep asking me about my eyes earlier. Why weren’t you afraid back then? You knew that I was different.’</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao stop, Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming took a few steps back further. Only after they were over two meters away from Lin Qiao did they stop.</p> <p>“You…you…Your eyes…What…happened?” Lu Tianyi pointed at Lin Qiao’s eyes and asked with a trembling voice.</p> <p>“She’s a zombie!” Kong Qingming said to Lu Tianyi, “She has become a zombie!”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi turned to look at Kong Qingming, his face filled with disbelief. He gazed at Kong Qingming and opened his mouth, but failed to utter any sound.</p> <p>He didn’t expect to see a pair of eyes like that under those sunglasses. He believed that even a pair of blind eyes would be better.</p>",
  "Chapter 198: Zombie or Human": "<p>Lin Xiao looked at the two in the eye for over ten seconds, then turned back and walked to the chair nearby. Turning the chair over, she sat down in front of the two. She understood that the two needed some time to process what they had just learned.</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Qiao took a seat, Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming relaxed a little. Without the pressure from her, their minds instantly became active.<br/>\nIn their eyes, Lu Tianyu looked exactly like a healthy human being, save for her eyes. Without seeing those eyes, no one would ever think that she was a zombie.</p> <p>Which zombie could be so clean and healthy-looking? Well, Qiu Lili was, but they hadn’t met her yet. In fact, even Qiu Lili had thick dark circles under their eyes. Xie Dong looked more like human than Qiu Lili, but the two didn’t know that he was a zombie too.</p> <p>‘Which zombie doesn’t eat humans? But this one saved us…And she can talk?’Kong Qingming’s brain worked relatively faster. He looked at Lin Qiao from head to toe and felt that she was nothing like a zombie as long as she kept the sunglasses on.</p> <p>But, if she wasn’t a zombie, why were her eyes like that?</p> <p>“What are you? Zombie? Human?” He asked.</p> <p>She looked like a human being, but had a zombie’s eyes. She had zombie eyes, but acted like a human! He had never heard about any zombie like this! While asking the question, Kong Qingming made an eye-contact with Lu Tianyi and found that the latter had the same question in his eyes. Then, they turned to look at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked and pointed a finger at them, then at her own head.<br/>\nShe wanted them to try figuring it out by themselves.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi fixed his eyes on Lin Qiao while blinking. Meanwhile, he connected all the guesses he had.</p> <p>According to what he found out before, Lu Tianyu had already died. So, it was indeed reasonable that she might have become a zombie. Her space power and the other unknown power were probably triggered after she became a zombie.</p> <p>However, why did she still have her humanity and consciousness after dying and turning into a zombie? And, she just ate a strawberry. Which zombie would eat strawberries!</p> <p>If she weren’t a zombie, why were her eyes look like that? And where did she get this space?</p> <p>All these puzzles kept spinning in Lu Tianyi’s head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao clearly sensed his complicated feelings, as well as Kong Qingming’s. She wondered how Lu Tianyi would react on finding out that his sister’s body was now occupied by another soul.</p> <p>She felt that she needed to make it clear with him, in case he really saw her as his evil sister and caused her some unnecessary troubles.</p> <p>As they calmed down, Lin Qiao prepared to take out the clipboard to write to tell them that she wasn’t Lu Tianyu. But right at that moment, she sensed a strong vibe from the outside.</p> <p>The look on her face changed as she abruptly stood up and disappeared.</p> <p>The group of people outside was resting on stone stairs. Huang Shou was asking Xie Dong all sorts questions, and the latter was writing the answers down.</p> <p>While he was writing, Lin Qiao suddenly showed up by his side. However, he didn’t see Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming coming out along with her.</p> <p>Without saying a word, Lin Qiao grabbed Xie Dong and Huang Shou, then the three of them disappeared together. In the next moment, she reappeared and brought another two people into her space.</p> <p>She moved very swiftly, appearing to be a little anxious.</p> <p>“Eh? What happened?” The others saw that she suddenly showed up and disappeared without some of their friends. The ones who had entered her space before all knew that she was bringing people back into her space.</p> <p>But, why didn’t she say anything? Why did she move so fast? What was going on?</p> <p>Lin Qiao reacted fast, but her sensations to the outside world weren’t sharp enough just now, because she was in her space. After spending a few seconds to drag Xie Dong and some of the others into her space, she knew that the time wasn’t enough for her to save the remaining five of them.</p> <p>‘Damn!’ When exiting her space again, she darted to the five and threw a kick toward the nearest one.</p> <p>“Ouch! You kick…” Only after he was sent flying to the side did Liu Jing, who suffered the kick, pop his eyes in shock and prepare to ask her why.<br/>\nHowever, before he finished his sentence, he heard a series of thunder.</p> <p>Following the rumbling thunders, an arm-thick bolt of lightning descended from the sky and landed on where the five were sitting.</p> <p>After kicking Liu Jing away, Lin Qiao turned around and kicked the man next to her, and then, she turned again to kick the others. However, after witnessing her kick away two men, the rest quickly moved to avoid being kicked by her.</p> <p>Seeing that, Lin Qiao made a sudden dodge aside as well.</p> <p>As everybody got away, another series of thunder was heard, and more lightning bolts landed where the group of people was sitting. Just like that, four or five lightning bolts blew up the area with a radius of about five meters.</p> <p>The ones who were thrown into Lin Qiao’s space were now looking at their two bosses with confusion. However, they found that their bosses were looking back at them in the same way.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?” Judging by Lin Qiao’s movement, Lu Tianyi sensitively felt that something bad was happening.</p> <p>“I don’t know. She just suddenly brought us here,” the puzzled Huang Shou responded, then glanced at Xie Dong. Xie Dong was with Lin Qiao, so Huang Shou guessed that he might know what was going on.</p> <p>Xie Dong closed his eyes, but then found that he couldn’t sense a thing from Lin Qiao’s space. When he opened his eyes, he saw Huang Shou looking at him, so he shook his head.</p> <p>The others were all confused.</p> <p>On the outside, Lin Qiao turned back right after the dodge, then crossed her arms above her head.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>A giant figure showed up before her, with a palm swinging at her head. It was behind Lin Qiao, but she reacted fast enough to turn her body and defend herself when it attacked. Its claw which was aiming at the back of her head now landed on her crossed arms.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Lin Qiao was sent flying backward, hitting against a wall and creating a hole in it.</p> <p>“Roar!” The giant figure landed on the middle of the road, then uttered a roar toward Lin Qiao, who was now inside the wall.</p>",
  "Chapter 199: Thunder-powered Zombie King": "<p>Before the others could realize what was happening, they heard a loud thud. As they turned to that direction, they saw a newly-created hole in the wall.</p> <p>After that, they heard a zombie roar. When they clearly saw the creature which uttered that roar, they were all stunned.</p> <p>They saw a two-meters tall, strange-looking figure standing there, facing the hole. It was male, extra tall and muscular, even looking like the fictional Hulk. However, Hulk was green, and this creature was blood-red.</p> <p>Its arms were as thick as an adult’s thighs, and its thighs were as thick as utility poles; its entire body was covered in blood. Its head looked relatively normal, but was bald.</p> <p>Meanwhile, bolts of purple lightning had been sizzling across its body.</p> <p>Its eyes which were glowing with a purple light were fixed on the hole created by Lin Qiao on the wall without glancing at the others. However, the ones who saw it now didn’t dare to move.</p> <p>What the hell was that!</p> <p>Liu Jing and the others stared at the big creature with shock. They had never seen such a giant zombie with glowing purple eyes and lightning bolts all over its body before!</p> <p>Only Lin Qiao, who was walking out of the wall, knew that it was a zombie king, at Qiu Lili’s level, and that it had the rare thunder power.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slowly walked out of the wall while, staring straight at the eyes of this zombie king through the sunglasses. The others couldn’t see her eyes, but the zombie king could see those clearly.</p> <p>It watched Lin Qiao walk out as if nothing had happened, and learned that its attack didn’t manage to bring her any harm at all.</p> <p>With discontentment, the thunder zombie king roared again at Lin Qiao.<br/>\n“Roar!”</p> <p>By roaring, it threatened to kill Lin Qiao unless she yielded. The latter received the message but kept walking forward while looking at the zombie king’s purple eyes.</p> <p>She was surrounded by this zombie king’s strong vibe, yet didn’t feel much of a pressure. The pressure she sensed was too slight to be noticed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that level-six zombie kings or queens could no longer suppress her now. After she upgraded, she felt that Qiu Lili’s vibe could no longer give her pressure. No wonder the latter couldn’t tell which level she was at.</p> <p>So now, she didn’t mind the minor pressure from this zombie king at all.</p> <p>She stooped about five meters away from the zombie king, then twisted her neck and stretched her shoulders. After that, she slightly raised her hands and released a stream of black mist.</p> <p>“Urrrrr…” As Lin Qiao refused to yield, the zombie king bared its teeth and growled with a deep voice. The black mist failed to catch the zombie king’s attention when it was just released. But soon, the mist grew thicker and thicker, spreading around Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Finally, the zombie king felt that something wasn’t right. It slightly narrowed its purple eyes, which sparkled with a weird light.</p> <p>The others now came back to their senses, quickly picking up the guns that Lin Qiao provided earlier and pointing them at the zombie king.</p> <p>A series of gunshots were then heard. Liu Jing and the others had taken covers, and were shooting at the zombie king. However, the bullets could hardly hurt the target. It turned its head suddenly and waved an arm toward the five people.</p> <p>With that, a few bolts of lightning fell from the sky along with thunders.</p> <p>“This is bad!” The few people burst in shouts while rolling away.</p> <p>When the zombie king turned its head, Lin Qiao grasped the opportunity and disappeared from where she was. The zombie king turned back to find that she was gone, so it instantly looked around with vigilance.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao had turned herself invisible and hopped onto a tree nearby. Then, she leaped onto the top of the streetlight nearest to the zombie king, and jumped at its head after that.</p> <p>When the zombie king was looking around in surprise, an invisible figure flashed about three meters higher than its head, then Lin Qiao showed her face.</p> <p>Lin Qiao flipped int he air, then swung her two claws at the zombie king’s head one after another.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie king reacted fast as well as it suddenly turned its body and rolled to the side.</p> <p>Puff! Puff!</p> <p>Once it rolled away, a few deep cuts were left on the ground.</p> <p>After the roll, the zombie king stood back up immediately, hunching its back slightly and giving a raging roar toward the few cuts on the ground. After that, it abruptly thrusted forward.</p> <p>On landing on the ground, Lin Qiao saw the zombie king charging at her like a bull. Meanwhile, waves of lightning bolts fell from the sky, coming at her entire body.</p> <p>As the lightning bolts were about to fall on her head, Lin Qiao made a roll to dodge. While doing that, she suddenly thought of Wu Chengyue, and recalled that she got struck by his lightning while trying to kindly send his daughter back to him.</p> <p>She was still unhappy about that!</p> <p>Once Lin Qiao dodged, the lightning bolts fell on the ground and left a series of small dents. At that moment, the zombie king nimbly turned around and pounced on her again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hurriedly made another dodge, then turned invisible.</p> <p>By then, her black mist had approached the zombie king. When pouncing on Lin Qiao, the zombie king suddenly lost its eyesight. It turned out that Lin Qiao was behind the black mist that she had released before to lead the zombie king into it.</p> <p>At the same time, she spared her willpower to control the mist and made it surround the zombie king. Therefore, the latter didn’t only miss its target, but also bumped into the black mist.</p> <p>The black mist penetrated its skin within no time.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie king roared thunderously; perhaps, it had felt some pain.</p> <p>“Roarrr!” While roaring, it struggled to get out of the mist. But soon, it realized that the black mist was sticking to its body. It rushed out of the cloud of mist, but its body was still wrapped in a layer of purely black mist.</p> <p>Maybe because the zombie king’s blood and flesh both contained rich energy, the black mist devoured it very slowly. However, that was enough to make this buffalo-like zombie king bleed.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar!” The zombie king slapped its body with its claws to try and sweep off the black mist on its body. But, its efforts were useless. On the contrary, more black mist wrapped around its hands.</p> <p>Soon enough, only shreds of muscles were left on its hands.</p>",
  "Chapter 200: Thunder vs Black Mist": "<p>Seeing that the weird and powerful zombie was temporarily trapped, the group of human beings felt slightly relieved and began retreating toward a safer place.</p> <p>“What level is that zombie? Why is it so tall and strong? Was it this tall before turning into a zombie?”</p> <p>“I don’t think so. I’ve sensed a very strong energy from its muscles. I guess it became like this after turning into a zombie.”</p> <p>“So which level it’s at? And its eyes are shining with a purple light. I’ve never seen a zombie like this.”</p> <p>“I don’t know. But I can tell it’s much more powerful than the three zombie leaders we saw before. Is this…a level-six, zombie king?”</p> <p>“Zombie king!” Hearing that, the others had their scalps numbed.</p> <p>“Quick, quick, quick! Let’s get away before it recovered!”</p> <p>“What…what about that lady?”</p> <p>“What lady! Didn’t you see that she has disappeared already! Are you dumb? She has a space! If she failed to defeat that zombie, she could simply hide in her space! What can possibly happen to her? It’s dangerous for us to stay here, and we might even hinder her! Go! Let’s go!”</p> <p>While speaking, the five people immediately turned to retreat to a farther area.</p> <p>The thunder zombie king couldn’t pay any attention to them at the moment. It slapped its body to try and get rid of the black mist, but failed. Afterward, it watched its blood and muscles disappear.</p> <p>The zombie immediately released dazzling purple light and lightning bolts from its body which covered its body and soon separated the black mist from it.</p> <p>The black mist and purple lightning collided, quickly producing a wisp of black smoke. The some rose into the sky, then spread out. The zombie king speedily rushed out of the black mist, uttering a strange sound.</p> <p>“Whoo…hum…whooo…hum…”</p> <p>After the black mist was dissipated, the zombie king looked even scarier than before. Earlier on, its body was simply covered in bloodstains, but now, it was badly mutilated. After every step it took, a large amount of sticky, black blood would drip onto the ground, forming a puddle.</p> <p>However, the bleeding barely affected the zombie king as it walked out of the mist, then raised its head to give a howl.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Two figures showed up, darting to the zombie king along with swishing noises and standing before it. At first glance, Lin Qiao recognized that those two were the two zombie leaders that she had scared away earlier.</p> <p>It turned out that these two were the zombie king’s underlings! They were here to help!</p> <p>The two zombie leaders bent toward the zombie king as Lin Qiao sensed the strong fear from them. They were afraid of the zombie king indeed.</p> <p>‘Why so afraid?’</p> <p>Before Lin Qiao figured it out, the zombie king suddenly made a step forward and inserted its claws which were shining with a purple light into the two zombie leaders’ throats.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>With that, the two zombie leaders’ heads were penetrated.</p> <p>After that, the zombie king pulled out its claws, each claw holding a zombie nucleus. The two zombie leaders died immediately, thudding against the ground.</p> <p>Now, Lin Qiao understood why the two zombie leaders were so frightened. They were afraid that the zombie king might kill them directly, but they didn’t dare to fight back. Therefore, without a choice, they let the zombie king take their life and dig out their zombie nuclei.</p> <p>The zombie king directly threw the two zombie nuclei which still had brain matters on them into its mouth, and swallowed. Then, it turned back while breathing loudly.</p> <p>It suddenly raised a hand to point at Lin Qiao’s black mist which hadn’t been dissipated entirely. After that, a series of rumbling thunder was heard, following which, finger-thick bolts of lightning struck on the black mist.</p> <p>The lightning landed on the ground along with thunderous sounds, and erased the black mist.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt suffocated when losing control of the black mist. She understood that the zombie king had dispersed the energy in the black mist, meaning that it would soon collapse.</p> <p>Lin Qiao now felt that level-six zombies were indeed not easy to deal with, as even the black mist wasn’t able to devour it. It was nimbler than her, so sneak attacks wouldn’t work either.</p> <p>How could she fight it them? Should she drag it into her space and let Viney take care of it? She wasn’t sure if Viney could suppress it.</p> <p>Besides, the zombie king was covered in blood and flesh shreds. It might pollute the lake water! Would the lake water remain drinkable if she threw this zombie into the lake?</p> <p>While Lin Qiao was considering how to kill the zombie king, the latter was looking for her. It was angry, because Lin Qiao took away its ordered food. The few zombie leaders which were responsible for delivering the food were scared away by her, and the food escaped. The zombie king had been starved for days. It was expecting the batch of people, as those living human beings would be a full meal. But, to its surprise, some other zombie took them away right in its territory.</p> <p>Moreover, the zombie which took its food was at a lower level than itself. If she were at its level, it might not be so infuriated.</p> <p>How dare a lower level zombie offend it! She was clearly challenging it.</p> <p>So, it had to tear that bold zombie into pieces, then dig out its nucleus.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao was confronting the zombie king, three trucks and two off-road vehicles were coming this way from about ten miles away. At that moment, Wu Yueling was huddling in Wu Chengyue’s arms, sleeping like a kitten with the straw dragonfly clenched tight in her hand.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue held his daughter as he looked outside through the car window. Xiao Yunlong, who sat beside him, was looking at a map. Without raising his head, Xiao Yunlong asked, “Are you sure that the thunder zombie king is in Upper City District? There’re so many zombies in this area. I think you can find tens of zombie leaders here.”</p> <p>Sea City Base people knew that the center of Hangzhou City had a high concentration of zombies. For that reason, independent squads wouldn’t enter that area. If tens of zombie leaders lived in that place, the existence of level-six zombie kings or queens was reasonable.</p> <p>No one would want to offend a zombie king or queen unless they had to. Whether they could kill the zombie king or queen was just one problem; if they failed to kill it, they might suffer the revenge of a zombie tide.</p> <p>Zombie kings and queens were smart, and could hold grudges.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded and responded, “Level-six zombies don’t always exist where you can find many level-five.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong raised his head to glance at him, then at Lingling, and said, “How confident are you? It’s too risky! If you can’t kill it, you know the consequences.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and nodded as he said, “I know. So, I’ll do everything I can to kill it. But, you’ll have to take care of Ling Ling for me.” He surely knew that if he failed to kill the zombie king, he would be hunted by it to the end of the world, and might be needing to face a zombie tide. If that happened, he would be in serious troubles.</p>",
  "Chapter 201: She Has No Time to Bring Them In": "<p>Xiao Yunlong raised a hand to pat the sleeping Wu Yueling gently, then brushed her bangs. “Sure, she’s my goddaughter. But, you have to think it thoroughly before you do it. If you’re not sure that you can kill it, you shouldn’t challenge it. Or, you’ll get us all in trouble.”</p> <p>Wu Yuecheng smiled at him, but didn’t say anything. Meng Yue turned back and looked at Xiao Yunlong as she said, “Alright, stop talking. You know that the three leaders of our base have all reached the same level now. He has to break into the next level as soon as possible. If the other two upgrade first, we’ll end up in a bad situation.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong frowned slightly and fell into silence. Meng Yue was right; if one of the three base leaders entered level-eight, the currently balanced situation would be broken. If Zou Shihui upgraded first, the situation of Wu Chengyue and his people wouldn’t be too bad, but if that man were Yang Chao, they would certainly be pushed down.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t have to take the risk if he wasn’t pushed by the current situation.</p> <p>“Hangzhou used to have a large population,” said Meng Yue, “so I think large amounts of supplies can be found in this city. If we killed the zombie king, we might be able to find tons of supplies. Think about that, we need something to look forward to after all.”</p> <p>The motorcade kept moving forward, toward where Lin Qiao was. Tens of miles would only take them a short while.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao was in an unpleasant situation herself. She had turned invisible, and the zombie king couldn’t find her. So, it went crazy and started attacking indiscriminately. Within the area with a radius of a hundred meters, huge lightning bolts fell from the sky.</p> <p>The lightning bolts struck on the surrounding buildings, trees, and utility poles. The shattered high-tension cables flew all over the sky; the bricks and concrete blocks fell from the buildings.</p> <p>Boom! Boom! Puff! Bang! Bang! Thunderous noises were heard without an end.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had flashed into her space. At the moment, she was standing by the lake with her eyes closed to observe the outside situation. She saw that the zombie king was rampaging, and was still looking for her.</p> <p>‘I’m hiding in my space, so what can you do? Blow whatever you want, do whatever you like. I have more energy than you anyway. You can just suit yourself,’ thought Lin Qiao. She couldn’t go out of the space for now, because once she did, she would suffer a lightning strike. The lightning would still hurt her even when she was invisible.</p> <p>The lightning bolts fell from the sky wave after wave like a rain. Lin Qiao guessed that when she exited her space again, she would only be able to see the flattened buildings and everything else in pieces.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and the others were standing behind her, watching her face the lake with her eyes closed. They didn’t know what she was doing.</p> <p>“Why did she suddenly throw us in? Why didn’t she bring Liu Jing and the others in?”</p> <p>“Yeah? Why only us? Boss, what did you say to her?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi glanced at them and said, “That has nothing to do with you. We’re also curious about why she brought us in here. We hadn’t finished our talking yet. She suddenly went out and threw you guys in.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming were utterly confused by Lin Qiao’s identity, and hadn’t yet processed what they had heard from her. And before their conversation ended, she abruptly went out and brought a few people in.</p> <p>“Did you discover anything out there? Why aren’t Liu Jing and the others in here?” Asked Kong Qingming.</p> <p>Huang Shou shook his head and responded confusedly, “Nothing unusual… We were chatting by the roadside when she suddenly showed up and brought us in without saying anything. And then, she dragged the rest of us in. Liu Jing and the others were left behind. We have no idea why she didn’t bring them.”</p> <p>At that moment, Xie Dong wrote a line on the notebook and showed it to the others—’She has no time to bring them in.’</p> <p>“No time? Why?” Reading that, the others asked bewilderedly.</p> <p>Judging by Lin Qiao’s movement, Xie Dong knew that she must have sensed something before she brought them in. Otherwise, why was even he dragged in here?</p> <p>It should be some kind of danger.</p> <p>Xie Dong only responded to the group of people by shaking his head.<br/>\nAt that moment, Lin Qiao opened her eyes and turned back to look at them, then said slowly, “…King…”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and the others failed to understand her meaning immediately.</p> <p>“King? What king?” asked Kong Qingming. Huang Shou and the others were quite disappointed by Lin Qiao’s dry and hoarse voice. They imagined her voice being pleasant to hear, maybe sexy and cool like a clear spring. But to their surprise, her voice wasn’t only hoarse, but was unpleasant, even deeper than a man’s voice.</p> <p>Unlike them, Xie Dong paused slightly, then looked at Lin Qiao with surprise while writing on the notebook—’Zombie king? Level six?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at him.</p> <p>The others also looked at the notebook out of curiosity. However, only Huang Shou who was right beside Xie Dong read the few words clearly.</p> <p>“Eh? Zombie king? Level six!” He popped his eyes afterward. Then, he immediately raised his head to look at Lin Qiao and the others. Hearing him, the others were stunned as well, face filled with disbelief. They couldn’t believe what they had heard.</p> <p>“Really!”</p> <p>“No way!”</p> <p>“Damn!”</p> <p>“Then Liu Jing and the others…” only Lu Tianyi thought of the five people. Reminded by them, the others all turned to Lin Qiao. She glanced at them, then closed her eyes and found that most of the lightning bolts out there had faded.</p> <p>So, she hurriedly gave Xie Dong a few hand gestures, then disappeared from where she was. Some of Lu Tianyi’s team understood Lin Qiao’s sign language, and some didn’t.</p> <p>Kong Qingming understood her meaning while Huang Shou understood a part of it as well because they had both served in the army. Kong Qingming’s brother used to be a scout, so every time he came home, he would teach him a lot of the military knowledge. The smart Kong Qingming learned quite some military skills from his brother since he was little, and just like his brother, he was also a talented scout. Therefore, he had been responsible for intelligence after losing his family and joining the base.</p> <p>Huang Shou hadn’t finished his first year in the army when the apocalypse happened, so he only understood half of Lin Qiao’s hand gestures. After all, he wasn’t in the special forces.</p> <p>The others were either college students or young workers. So, only Xie Dong and Kong Qingming had fully understood Lin Qiao’s meaning. Huang Shou figured out that Lin Qiao’s gestures were from a certain type of military force, but didn’t know what they meant exactly.</p>",
  "Chapter 202: Hopeless Situation Of The Five": "<p>After Lin Qiao left, Lu Tinanyi immediately turned to Kong Qingming while Huang Shou looked at Xie Dong.</p> <p>“What did she mean? Is she going out to save our friends?” Huang Shou asked Xie Dong anxiously, who glanced at Kong Qingming, as he knew that the latter understood Lin Qiao’s meaning.</p> <p>“She told us to wait here, and she’ll try saving them. But, she’s not sure how many people can she save,” said Kong Qingming.</p> <p>Huang Shou turned to look at Xie Dong. As Xie Dong nodded, he sighed with relief. But soon, Xie Dong found that the way Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming looked at him was a little weird, even though he couldn’t figure out why yet.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming assumed that Xie Dong was aware of the fact that Lin Qiao was a zombie, so, they wondered what made him follow her willingly, and how he had been seeing her.</p> <p>On the outside, Lin Qiao turned herself invisible once she exited the space, then leaped aside and rolled on the ground to dodge the lightning bolts which were about to land on her body.</p> <p>Once she showed up, the zombie king sensed her location. But thankfully, she reacted fast.</p> <p>The moment Lin Qiao stopped moving, a new lightning bolt flashed down right toward her, and she hurriedly rolled again to the side. She knew that the zombie king was attacking randomly, as it didn’t know where exactly she was.</p> <p>After rolling, she tightened her body and sprung up from the ground. Then, she dodged the lightning bolts falling from the sky and tried to dart out of the coverage of the zombie king’s lightning attack.</p> <p>The zombie king’s lightning bolts fell from the sky without a pattern, so Lin Qiao had no choice but to pay attention to them while choosing her way of moving. However, that wasn’t a hard thing for her. With a few turns, she moved to a few meters away. After that, she kept running forward while dodging the lightning bolts falling onto her head.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar! Roar” After a series of savage lightning attacks, the zombie king found that its attack barely had any effect. So, it suddenly roared out loud resonantly.</p> <p>Hearing that roar, Lin Qiao knew that something bad would happen.</p> <p>The zombie king was summoning more zombies. Once those zombies returned, the five people would be in danger. Thinking of that, Lin Qiao immediately darted toward Liu Jing and the others.</p> <p>On the other side, Liu Jing and the others had been fleeing away from the zombie king in panic. However, before they ran far away, they heard the rumbling thunder.</p> <p>Raising their heads to see a wave of dazzling lightning bolts descending from the sky, they were all stunned. Was the zombie king going to kill them all?</p> <p>At that moment, these few people began to curse in their heads. ‘Damn! Why didn’t you give us a heads-up before launching the massive attack!’</p> <p>However, the situation didn’t allow them to complain. Instead, they burst in yells while dashing into a nearby building.</p> <p>“Take cover!”</p> <p>Fortunately, the massive lighting attack only shattered some window glasses and made some small concrete blocks fall from the building. The building itself remained sturdy.</p> <p>The five were hiding on the first floor. For the time being, they were safe from the lightning, as the building wouldn’t fall apart. However, as the five saved themselves from being struck by lightning bolts, they were trapped in the building.</p> <p>Looking at the dazzling lightning and hearing the thunderous noises, one of them said with a dark face, “Where is the lightning come from? These aren’t created by the weird zombie, are they?”</p> <p>Just now, they all saw the purple lightning bolts coiled around the tall zombie king’s body, and guessed that it had thunder power.</p> <p>“I think so! What the hell is that? I don’t think a level-five zombie can be so powerful!”</p> <p>“That…that lady, is she fighting the zombie now? This lightning power is so cool! Damn! Nearly as great as the power of our Chief Purple Thunder!”</p> <p>“Whatever the case might be, we should figure out a way to leave this place. I think we’re still too close to it, and it’s very dangerous!”</p> <p>“But, we can’t get out now. We don’t know how long this lightning attack will last.”</p> <p>The five understood that any attack generated by superpower energies couldn’t last long. So, they planned to wait until the lightning bolts faded and then run out.</p> <p>After a few minutes, the coverage of the lightning bolts shrank, but the five were still threatened by them.</p> <p>“Look, it’s shrinking!” Liu Jing looked out of a shattered window and found that the lightning bolts on one side were disappearing while the ones on the other side were still striking.</p> <p>“We can’t get out! We’re about two meters away from the safe area,” another man came over as he measured the distance with his eyes and said. In order to get to the safe area, they needed to get out of the room and move through the corridor nearby. But by doing that, they would expose themselves to the violent lightning bolts.</p> <p>“Wait!”</p> <p>At that very moment, they heard a long and resonant roar.</p> <p>“What’s that sound? Zombie roar?”</p> <p>“That sounds a little different.”</p> <p>In less than a minute, one of them abruptly pointed at the boundary between the lightning area and the safe area and shouted, “Look! That…”</p> <p>The others turned to find a giant crowd of zombies approaching.</p> <p>“How…Why so many zombies!”</p> <p>“I get it. They’re summoned by the roar we heard just now.”</p> <p>“There…are too many zombies! What should we do? Even if we made it to the safe area, we’d be torn into pieces by these zombies!” Facing the suddenly appeared zombie crowd, the five showed despair on their faces.</p> <p>One of them lowered his head as he leaned against the wall and weakly sat to the ground, his eyes unfocused. “We’re dead,” he said. “We won’t survive this. I thought we’d be going home safe as we were saved from the three level-five zombies, but now…”</p> <p>The others fell into silence.</p> <p>That man was right. If they went out now, they would either be torn apart by the zombie crowd or be struck by lightning. There was no other choice left for them.</p> <p>“Why…why us…” another guy murmured. The others looked at him confusedly. Then, they heard him continue, “Why did she leave us out here…Why didn’t she drag us into her space just now?”</p>",
  "Chapter 203: I Don’t Know You Well": "<p>Hearing that, the others all started to blame the fate as well. Liu Jing opened his mouth, but didn’t say anything. Under such a situation, it was understandable for these people to have negative feelings.</p> <p>But at that time, one of them said, “It’s okay. It’s better than letting the others die. If some people have to die here today, then let it be us. I’m fine with it. If we survive, I’ll take it as I’ve earned an extra life.”</p> <p>“Two…lives…” Suddenly, a hoarse voice joined the conversation.</p> <p>“What two lives? Where can we find two lives?” The five didn’t recognize that voice and responded without thinking. But in three to four seconds, they quickly raised their heads to look at the door, as if they had woken up from a dream with a start.</p> <p>They saw a person standing by the door, but didn’t know when she arrived.</p> <p>She was wearing a military vest, a part of her slim waist exposed. The loose-fitting camouflage trousers and combat boots didn’t manage to hide the beautiful shape of her long and slender legs. A camouflage coat was wrapped around her shoulders; she was also wearing a hat and a pair of sunglasses.</p> <p>She crossed her arms before her chest while looking at the five calmly and blandly.</p> <p>“Sis-sister!” Liu Jing recognized her the first, then rushed at Lin Qiao with excitement and joy. “Sister! You’re here! We thought we were dead this time!” He howled with a crying face.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took a small step aside to dodge him while maintaining a perfect composure.</p> <p>‘I don’t know you well, so I don’t want a passionate hug from you! And why are you crying? You’re a man!’ Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>The others looked at her in shock. The man who was radiating a strong negative emotion just now stood up from the ground. Lin Qiao raised a hand to show them two fingers, then said, “You…owe…me…two…lives…”</p> <p>As she finished talking, the others all realized what had just happened. They felt that they were riding a roller coaster, being thrown up and down from time to time. The few despairing people even wanted to jump onto Lin Qiao and hug her hard, even though one of them had just tried once and failed.</p> <p>They called Lin Qiao sister because they were all young men. The eldest one among them was twenty-five; before the apocalypse, he was just a college student. The others were at high school when the old world ended, and now were only around twenty years old.</p> <p>As the powerful Lin Qiao was able to save them, they were even willing to call her Grandma. They excitedly listened to her words, then finally calmed themselves a little.</p> <p>The oldest one among the five was named Zheng Xiaonian. His name was rather cute, but he was a composed young man. He stared at Lin Qiao and said, “Two lives! I owe you two lives! I’ll follow you from now on! I’ll abandon Captain Lu!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao found his words amusing. She waved a hand to him and said, “Don’t…say…that…now”</p> <p>‘Your boss is in my space right now. Is it really okay for you to openly betray him like that?’ While thinking, she reached out a hand to drag Liu Jing and Zheng Xiaonian, who were the nearest to her, into her space. In the next second, she flashed out and brought the others in.</p> <p>Once in, Liu Jing saw Lu Tianyi and the others and rushed at them while yelling, “Captain!” Lu Tianyi and the others didn’t dodge, just stood still and caught him. Liu Jing was young as well. He matured quite a lot after the apocalypse, but still, he relied on his bosses.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi hugged him and patted his back to comfort him. He knew that the five were just saved from a very dangerous situation, so he understood how they must have felt.</p> <p>He turned to look at Lin Qiao. He was going to say thank you to her, but before that, he saw her walk to the bucket beside the stove.</p> <p>She opened the lid, picked up the water scoop, and handed it to them while saying, “Here…drink…”</p> <p>Xie Dong walked to her side, then turned and looked at the group of people. Huang Shou looked at him, then at Lin Qiao, and said, “Is she inviting us all to drink?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at him, then turned to Lu Tianyi, who hesitated. He and Kong Qingming glanced at each other. They both knew that Lin Qiao was a zombie, so they were worried that the water might not be safe.</p> <p>However, the others didn’t have the same doubts. Seeing the water, they all rushed up. They didn’t think as much as their bosses did. Just now, Huang Shou and a few of the others wanted to directly drink from the lake when they came in, but their bossed stopped them. They thought that drinking from the lake without the permission of its owner was impolite, so they didn’t ask a question but gave up.</p> <p>But now, as the lake owner had invited them to drink, they just ignored their bosses.</p> <p>The few people darted to Lin Qiao as Huang Shou grabbed the water scoop from her hand, got some water from the bucket, and then directly poured into his mouth.</p> <p>“Eh…” Seeing that, Lu Tianyi reached out a hand but didn’t manage to say a word. He watched Huang Shou pour a big half scoopful of water into his mouth, then recalled that he had eaten a mutant strawberry provided by the zombie lady. Nothing happened to him yet, but…</p> <p>He sighed.</p> <p>Huang Shou filled his stomach with water, then handed the scoop to one of the others. Then, he asked Liu Jing, “What happened you just now on the outside? What did you see?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao had told them that the creature out there was a level-six zombie king, but they didn’t believe it. However, they all understood that finding a zombie king in this place was just a normal thing, as lots of level-five zombie leaders were living here.</p> <p>Liu Jing glanced at Lin Qiao, then replied, “One zombie, seems to be at level-six…thunder power. Where we were just now, the area hundred-meters squared was nearly flattened by lightning bolts. We rushed into a building just now, or we would have been burned by now.”</p> <p>Finishing talking, he fixed his eyes on the water in the bucket. Seeing the others drinking happily, he couldn’t help but push Huang Shou away and get closer to the bucket.</p> <p>Hearing him mention a level-six zombie, Huang Zhou gave a start, then looked at Lin Qiao with surprise. He had heard that people called level-six zombies kings and queens. A level-six zombie could be incredibly powerful, such that a level-six superpowered human being would either be killed or disabled by a zombie king or queen unless that human was as powerful as a base leader.</p> <p>That zombie king out there had thunder power. So, exactly how powerful was it?</p> <p>And more importantly, how did the lady save the five from the legendary zombie king?</p> <p>At that point, Zheng Xiaonian walked over and said, “A huge zombie crowd showed up in the area without lightning. We were trapped in the building. If we had gone out, we would have been attacked by the zombie crowd.”</p> <p>He was trying to say that if the mysterious lady didn’t bring them into her space, they might have really died this time.</p>",
  "Chapter 204: Zombies Can Hold A Grudge Too": "<p>Lu Tianyi glanced at Lin Qiao, then asked abruptly, “Are you no match for the level-six zombie out there?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao rolled her eyes. Lu Tianyi didn’t see her expression, but he somehow felt being despised. He thought for a moment, then felt that he had guessed right. ‘If she could defeat the zombie king, she wouldn’t need to hide in here with us. But, she saved all of us, and that’s already amazing.”</p> <p>However, he had another question, “So what should we do now? Stay in your space until it has left?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the group of people who had been waiting for their turn to drink water, then walked to Xie Dong and patted him. He looked at her and saw her point at the area with the kitchenware. Some cups and bowls were placed there.</p> <p>Xie Dong nodded and walked over. He understood Lin Qiao’s meaning: she wanted him to give those people some cups for them to drink water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to that area along with Xie Dong, picked up a stainless steel plate, then turned and crooked a finger toward Lu Tianyi. After that, she walked toward the strawberry field. Maybe because of her space, those strawberry plants were thriving more and more! Those plants even bore a lot of new strawberries, even though the strawberry season had passed.</p> <p>The first batch of strawberries had all been picked long ago, some of which were eaten by the rabbit and the few mice.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over with the plate, then bent over to pick the ripe strawberries and put them in the plate. Meanwhile, she talked to Lu Tianyi, who was two meters away behind her.</p> <p>“It…will…hold…a…grudge…Guard…here…” Lin Qiao talked very slowly, so Lu Tianyi had guessed her meaning even before she finished.</p> <p>Was she trying to say the level-six zombie king would stay in this area? But, why? And, what grudge would it hold?</p> <p>“What grudge? Does it know that we’re all in your space, and that you’re here too so you can’t leave? Can it understand all this?” Lu Tianyi asked confusedly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted to pick a strawberry. Hearing his question, she paused, then put the strawberry in the plate and turned to look at him while saying, “It…is…as…smart…as…you…”</p> <p>The zombie king could even be smarter than Lu Tianyi. Whatever Lu Tianyi could guess out, it could too. Besides, the group of people all disappeared suddenly without showing a sign of leaving, so the zombie king would have figured that Lin Qiao had a space.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi didn’t know what to say. He turned to glance at the others who were about twenty meters away, then turned back and asked with a low voice, “How…did you die?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her head to look at him. She spent a moment reviewing Lu Tianyu’s memory before death, then said, “Knocked…out…Thrown…into…zombie…crowd…”</p> <p>While finishing this one sentence, she had picked quite a few strawberries; soon, about fifteen large strawberries were put in the plate. She stood up and walked toward Xie Dong and the others while carrying the plate while Lu Tianyi pondered over Lin Qiao’s words.</p> <p>‘She was knocked out and thrown into a zombie crowd? How? Did those people hit her from behind or directly turned against her and attacked? The three were all superpowered while she was an ordinary human being. So, they should have been able to put her down effortlessly,’ Lu Tianyi thought. ‘But why knock her out and throw into a zombie crowd instead of killing her?’</p> <p>‘If she weren’t dead but only fainted, she must have woken up because of the pain while being torn and bitten by the zombies. And she woke up to find herself being chewed by a giant group of zombies.’</p> <p>‘How terrible was that!’</p> <p>With these thoughts, Lu Tianyi looked at Lin Qiao’s back with a complicated look. Meanwhile, he wondered how she became a conscious zombie.</p> <p>‘Did she eat any human beings when she just turned into a zombie?’ All sorts of questions lingered in Lu Tianyi’s head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the bucket. The ones who finished drinking had all moved to the side and sat on the ground. She took over the water scoop from a man’s hand, then filled it with water and poured all the strawberries in. After that, she handed the scoop to those people.</p> <p>“Eat…”</p> <p>By that time, the group of people had all discovered that Lin Qiao’s voice and way of talking was a little strange. However, they didn’t ask any questions, but looked at the extra large strawberries in the water scoop with confusion.</p> <p>Was she telling them to eat these mutant strawberries? No way!</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them in the eyes, then nodded to confirm. She abruptly pointed at Lu Tianyi who was slowly walking over, then said, “He…ate…”</p> <p>‘Your boss has eaten one, and he’s fine. What are you afraid of?’</p> <p>Hearing that, the group of people all turned to look at Lu Tianyi with surprise.</p> <p>“Boss, you ate these?”</p> <p>“No way! Boss, why did you eat it?”</p> <p>“Boss, are you sure that these are edible?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi walked over as he silently looked at them, then at Lin Qiao. He wasn’t sure, and he didn’t eat that strawberry voluntarily. He was partially forced to eat it! But at least, he was fine at the time. He couldn’t tell if the strawberry was safe, or the poison was yet to attack.</p> <p>As these people were scared, Lin Qiao didn’t force them to eat, but handed the water scoop to Xie Dong. Then, she shrugged toward those people and turned to sit in the chair nearby.</p> <p>‘Eat these or not. I’m not the one who’s about to be starved to death anyway,’ she thought.</p> <p>The group of people were surprised. They didn’t understand why Lin Qiao offered them some mutant strawberries. But, as they had been starved for two days, they couldn’t help but keep glancing at the plate in Xie Dong’s hands, even though they had all been trying to tell themselves to calm down first.</p> <p>They looked at Lu Tianyi, hoping to hear from him that the strawberries were fine. But in the meanwhile, they worryingly wondered if any changes had happened to his body.</p> <p>Under the gazes of the group of people, Lu Tianyi finally started talking, “I’ve indeed eaten a few. I haven’t sensed any change in my body yet. But, I’m not sure what will happen in an hour, or a day or two.”</p> <p>“According to experiments,” said Kong Qingming, “A human being bitten by a zombie will turn into a zombie in three minutes after death. If this person is weak, he or she will die very soon, and if this person is relatively strong, this process will be longer. I think we all know that.”</p> <p>The others nodded, as what he said was indeed a common sense.</p> <p>Kong QingmingQingming continued, “We don’t know how long it will take for a person to turn into a zombie after he or she eats some mutant plants or animals. But eventually, this person will die and turn into a zombie.”</p> <p>He was trying to say that anyone who ate any mutant plants or animals would all become a zombie in the end, sooner or later. Some mutant plants and animals could kill people in three seconds, but sometimes, that process could last for three days, thirty days, or even three months.</p>",
  "Chapter 205: Don’t Smack Your Lips": "<p>Lin Qiao didn’t plan to spend time explaining, and just left them alone to make the decision. She stood up abruptly and flashed out of the space, as she thought that it was time to leave this place. She wanted very much to kill the zombie king out there. However, it had a strong energy and great power, and her black mist could hardly hurt it.</p> <p>Her claws wouldn’t work either.</p> <p>She was able to sneak away safely though. Perhaps, she should leave the zombie king to Qiu Lili, or the two of them could fight it together.</p> <p>But now, she had to explore the Upper City District, to find out if there was a second zombie king in this place. At the same time, she also needed to check the Lower City District.</p> <p>Lin Qiao exited her space and showed up in the building where she had found Liu Jing and the other few. She looked outside and found that the coverage of the lightning had shrunk further. No more thunders could be heard from outside the building, and by now, the building was surrounded by zombies.</p> <p>She blinked, then quickly turned invisible and ran upstairs. Reaching the second floor, she saw a tall figure rush into the lobby on the first floor from outside.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>While running, Lin Qiao glanced back, thinking that the zombie king really had sharp sensations. She didn’t think that it would dart over here so soon.<br/>\nShe had been in this building for just two seconds, yet the zombie king had shown up already.</p> <p>The zombie king stormed into the building along with a wave of lightning bolts. The lightning coiled on its body buzzed and then exploded, sweeping across the entire lobby.</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>However, the zombie king had no idea that Lin Qiao had run upstairs.</p> <p>The zombie crowd gathered around the building. Looking down, Lin Qiao saw that the area one mile in radius was crowded with ordinary zombies. She had gotten used to flying across roofs, so in her eyes, these ordinary zombies were nothing.</p> <p>She ignored the crowd of roaring zombies and directly leaped onto another building. Then, she looked around and darted out toward one direction.<br/>\nTo find the places with rich storage of supplies, she needed a map of special government departments. That kind of map could only be found in the planning bureau.</p> <p>So, where was the Planning Bureau of Hangzhou City?</p> <p>Thinking about this question, Lin Qiao paused on the roof of a building, looking confusedly at the zombie crowd which was moving toward the location of the zombie king. Later, she took out the two map books she had and began browsing.</p> <p>As she had thought, she couldn’t find it. So, where should she find this Planning Bureau and get some internal information? Thinking that she had been running about without a direction, she felt a little speechless.</p> <p>Silently, she squatted by the edge of the roof, counting the zombies down there.</p> <p>‘Maybe the group of people in my space have the answer? Eh, both my brain and memory aren’t working as well as before ever since I became a zombie.’</p> <p>‘Sigh, my brain is damaged, damaged!’</p> <p>After mourning over her brain for about two seconds, Lin Qiao stood up and glanced at the zombie crowd which was continuously gathering toward the zombie king, then turned and entered her space again.</p> <p>Once in, she saw that the group of people had moved to the furniture area. They were sitting on couches while surrounding a table, and were silently staring at the plateful of washed strawberries.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over and found that those strawberries hadn’t been touched. She got closer and stood beside them while looking at them.</p> <p>As she showed up, the group of people all turned to look at them. She remained silent for a few seconds, then bent over to pick up a strawberry and put in her mouth.</p> <p>The group of people watched her finish the strawberry. After that, Lin Qiao smacked her lips, tasting the faint sour flavor in her mouth. Then, she rubbed her chin and wondered if salt would taste salty in her mouth by now. The strawberry should be sweet, but she only tasted the sourness.</p> <p>The group of people gazed at her without even blinking. Lin Qiao looked them in the eyes for a few seconds, then somehow, she wore the same bewildered look as them. Xie Dong was the only expressionless one. Unlike him, Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming had been eyeing her with surprise.</p> <p>Even though their looks were a little different, the three of them now shared the exact same thought—’You’re a zombie! Why are you eating strawberries! And, don’t smack your lips!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao was pretty close to them, so she had surely sensed their thoughts. Silently, she glanced at Xie Dong and Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>After that, she pointed at the strawberries and asked the others, “Not…eat?”</p> <p>The group of people shook their heads together, but meanwhile, they couldn’t help but swallow their saliva.</p> <p>Before Lin Qiao showed up, they were silently controlling their appetite. But on seeing Lin Qiao eat the strawberry and smack her lips, their appetites were aroused again.</p> <p>Finally, Xie Dong couldn’t bear watching all this. He turned and looked around, then found Lin Qiao’s clipboard on another table. So, he walked over, picked it up and walked back to the group.</p> <p>Then, he took out a color pen and wrote—’Just eat, these are really safe! Earlier on, a little girl ate these for many days, and she’s still fine.’</p> <p>In fact, he was a little not confident while writing the last sentence, because he had never seen the little princess again, and didn’t know how she was doing right now.</p> <p>However, he believed that these strawberries were safe, because Lin Qiao had said so. Besides, she didn’t have a reason to poison these people.</p> <p>As for why she saved them, Xie Dong didn’t understand.</p> <p>Reading Xie Dong’s note, the others hesitated, but Huang Shou was the first to give in. Tortured by hunger, he chose to believe Xie Dong and Lin Qiao. He had survived the zombies, but he felt that he was going to starve to death if he didn’t eat anything now.</p> <p>He sat straight and said, “I…I choose to die without starvation. We can’t get out or find any other food right now. If we get out, we’ll be eaten by zombies. So, I’d rather die comfortably.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao rolled her eyes as she crossed her arms before her chest.</p> <p>‘Who wants you to die? If I wanted you to die, why would I put in so much effort to save you?’</p> <p>Xie Dong too rolled his eyes, then wrote on the clipboard—’Idiot! If she wanted you to die, why would she go through all the troubles to save you?’</p> <p>Huang Shou quickly read the note and paused briefly, then murmured, “You’re right! So, these strawberries are safe?” While speaking, he took in a deep breath and reached out a hand. Before touching the strawberries, he paused slightly, then suddenly grabbed one.</p> <p>He pinched it slightly and felt that it was like normal strawberries, just slightly larger. He looked at the strawberry, then glanced at the others and found that they were all staring at him.</p> <p>Under the gaze of the others, he slowly put the strawberry into his mouth. However, before biting, he suddenly took it out.</p> <p>A bit perturbed, he said to the others, “Why are you looking at me like that? If you want to know how it tastes, you should ask our Boss. Didn’t he eat some before?”</p> <p>While speaking, he pointed at Lu Tianyi, who didn’t know what to say.</p>",
  "Chapter 206: Collision Between Thunder Powers": "<p>The group of people immediately turned their eyes from Huang Shou to Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi puzzled at first, then gave a faint smile and said, “These are delicious, sweet, and refreshing. If you don’t mind that they’re mutant, you can just eat.”</p> <p>At that moment, Huang Shou had already taken a bite of the strawberry and carefully chewed it. He found that it really tasted not bad, so after finishing the first bite quickly, he took another bite.</p> <p>As Huang Shou started eating, the others each took a strawberry and put in their mouths. Seeing that, Lin Qiao walked to Xie Dong and took over the clipboard from his hands, then wrote down a line.</p> <p>‘Does any one of you know which district the Planning Bureau of Hangzhou City is located in?’</p> <p>She first showed it to Xie Dong, but the latter shook his head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed, thinking if only she could still search online with a cellphone or a computer. Without internet, a detailed map, or GPS, what could she do?</p> <p>She turned to face the clipboard to the group of people who were eating strawberries, then knocked it with the pen to make some noise. Hearing the noise, the others instantly turned to her.</p> <p>“Planning Bureau? Why are you going there?”</p> <p>‘Does anyone know?’—Lin Qiao wrote.</p> <p>The group of people shook their heads. None of them were from Hangzhou City, so they didn’t know about the locations of the government departments.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed disappointedly, then threw the clipboard toward Xie Dong.</p> <p>At that point, Kong Qingming who had been staring at her the whole time said, “West Lake District…But, you’ll have to find out the specific location yourself.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned and looked at him. West Lake District? Didn’t they come from that area?</p> <p>“I remember hearing that from a friend,” said Kong Qingming.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rubbed her chin. So, they needed to return to the West Lake District to find the Planning Bureau. She wondered if she could still find the files she needed. Hopefully, those files weren’t damaged.</p> <p>With these thoughts, she turned to Xie Dong and nodded, who understood her meaning and wrote, ‘We’re heading to West Lake District now. By the time we have found what we need, you’ll have recovered. You should wait until your powers are back before leaving.’</p> <p>Lu Tianyi glanced at Lin Qiao. In fact, he still had so many questions to ask her. However, she didn’t give him any time but turned and left. Then, she stood on the roof, looking down at the zombie crowd. She now had no choice but to make another trip to the West Lake District.</p> <p>She knew that Kong Qingming wasn’t lying, because she could sense it.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Chengyue and his people found something strange once they entered the Binjiang District from Qiaoshan District.</p> <p>The surrounding ordinary zombies were all moving toward the Upper City District. And strangely, those zombies all ignored their motorcade. Their vehicles were firmly armed, but they should still have attracted the attention of lots of zombies.</p> <p>However, this time, all those zombies neglected them, only shambling toward the Upper City District.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was going to that area as well.</p> <p>He ordered the motorcade to stop on a road between Binjing District and Upper City Distract, then began heading to the Upper City District alone.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong and Meng Yue stayed in Binjing District, taking care of Wu Yueling while waiting for him to return. Wu Chengyue planned to kill the zombie king in the Upper City District, then come back to lead his people in and collect the supplies.</p> <p>However, after entering the Upper City District, Wu Chengyue had a very strange feeling. He climbed onto a building, then looked down at the surrounding zombie crowd and found them all moving toward one direction.</p> <p>Focusing his sensations toward that direction, Wu Chengyue sensed a faint thunder power, and noticed that the sky in that area was dark. Then, Wu Chengyue realized that it was what he was here for.</p> <p>In the next moment, his tall and slim body flashed across the air and disappeared. When he showed up again, he was less than five-hundred meters away from the zombie king. He restrained his vibe and stood on the edge of a roof while looking down.</p> <p>‘What’s going on?’ He wondered as he saw a massive crowd of zombies, and waves of thunderbolts falling from the sky five-hundred meters away.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar! Roarrrr!” Zombie roars were heard from everywhere.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s handsome face wore a confused look while he moved forward for about two-hundred meters. He was confused because all those ordinary zombies seemed to be summoned, and he couldn’t figure out why the zombie king would suddenly summon so many ordinary zombies.</p> <p>The closer he got, the denser the zombie crowd got, and the lower the zombie roars turned.</p> <p>He had sensed the violent vibe of the zombie king and faintly felt a great pressure. Even as a level-seven superpowered human being, he felt a little oppressed. He was sure that the zombie king was under the falling lightning bolts. However, he didn’t understand why it was so angry.</p> <p>‘I really shouldn’t be here now. I guess the zombie king is pissed off by someone or something.’ While thinking, he continued approaching the zombie king.</p> <p>At the distance of about two hundred meters, he stopped on the roof of a tall building, took out a telescope, and looked at the area with lightning bolts through it.</p> <p>At that moment, he was surprised by what he saw—an over two-meters-tall figure was dashing about on that road. Its body was covered in blood, as if its skin had been peeled off. He saw its dark-purple muscles and the bones on its back.</p> <p>Its head was bloody too, such that Wu Chengyue couldn’t see its face clearly, save for a pair of purple eyes filled with ferocity. Its teeth were bared, and it was roaring ragingly.</p> <p>The zombie king seemed to be in a fury.</p> <p>Whoever offended it now would either be struck into ashes by lightning bolts or torn into pieces by it.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue watched the zombie king bump into buildings like a mad bull. It rushed into a store, then broke out of the window and darted into the building next door; after that, it leaped down from a balcony. It seemed that it was searching for something.</p> <p>Sometimes, it would leap through the roofs.</p> <p>‘Is the zombie king on drugs? Why is it so furious?’ Wu Chengyue thought.</p> <p>As he was observing the zombie king through the telescope, the zombie king suddenly paused. In the next moment, it turned back and looked at him straight in the eyes.</p> <p>‘No! He found me!’</p> <p>Wu Chengyue put down the telescope as he glanced at the zombie king with a serious look, then turned back and fled hurriedly.</p> <p>As he landed on the roof of a building twenty meters away, the first building was flattened by a few thigh-thick lightning bolts, along with a series of rumbling sound.</p>",
  "Chapter 207: Level-six vs Level-seven": "<p>Wu Chengyue only had the time to take one peek before stepping back and swinging an arm down. Following his movement, a thigh-thick purple lightning bolt fell from the sky.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue only brought down one bolt of lightning, but it accurately and suddenly fell toward the head of the zombie king, which was charging at him.</p> <p>The zombie king raised its head to find the lightning bolt coming at its head, so it uttered a raging roar, flipped in the air, then magically moved toward another direction.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>The zombie king landed on a nearby building, its claws leaving deep scratches on the building. Then, it suddenly thrust its legs against the building and pounced on Wu Chengyue again.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>The zombie king was so swift that it darted up behind Wu Chengyue within a moment and swung its claws at him along with a wave of lightning. Following its movement, the lightning bolts released from its arms coiled into a giant claw, striking at him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue swung his arms toward the zombie king while drawing back, and threw a lightning bolt at it. The zombie king didn’t dodge, but let his lightning land on its body as it insisted on attacking him with the lightning claw.</p> <p>A series of thunder was heard as the zombie king brought down a massive wave of thunderbolts that struck out destructively; both Wu Chengyue and the zombie king were in the coverage of this wave of thigh-thick lightning bolts.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s face turned dark. He hurriedly flipped in the air and landed on the zombie crowd, then stepped on zombie heads as he leaped to the side.</p> <p>The ordinary zombies under his feet sensed his vibe and raised their hands to reach at him, but before that, he was already on another spot.</p> <p>He hopped like that into a balcony and quickly hid in that building.</p> <p>The zombie king suffered Wu Chengyue’s lightning bolt, but still, it darted out of the dense smoke while seeming perfectly unharmed.</p> <p>However, its bloody body had turned black.</p> <p>That barely affected the zombie king, only making it uglier.</p> <p>At that time, Wu Chengyue suddenly showed up on the roof of another building and swung both arms. Following his moves, a few thick bolts of lightning descended toward the zombie king.</p> <p>They had the same type of power. Even as a level-seven, Wu Chengyue seemed to be falling into a disadvantage as the zombie king was chasing behind him and attacking endlessly.</p> <p>But in fact, he could always easily dodge the zombie king’s attack.</p> <p>At the moment, a series of lightning bolts fell onto the zombie king one after another. It slightly raised its head to glance at them, then carelessly charged at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>But soon, a lightning bolt slightly turned in the air and continued striking at the zombie king. And following the first lightning bolt, the second and third turned as well.</p> <p>The zombie king which suddenly sensed danger turned back and swung its arms to send out a few lighting claws, colliding against Wu Chengyue’s lightning.</p> <p>Crack! Boom! Rumble!</p> <p>Soon enough, the lightning claws were dissipated by Wu Chengyue’s series of lightning bolts.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue now realized that the zombie king’s attacks were powerful, but were launched randomly without any plan. Fighting this way was highly energy-consuming, and this fighting style was rather easy to deal with.</p> <p>As the zombie king turned back to defend itself from Wu Chengyue’s lightning bolts, he suddenly raised both hands toward it with his fingers crooked and palms facing each other, as if holding the zombie king in his hands.</p> <p>After that, a lightning sphere slowly emerged around the zombie king and wrapped it up.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie king’s lightning claws only affected the first bolt of lightning, but failed to hold off the rest.</p> <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p> <p>After the zombie king suffered the series of lightning bolts, Wu Chengyue’s lightning sphere was done.</p> <p>The series of lightning bolts made the zombie king pause a little. It thought that those lightning bolts of Wu Chengyue were as powerful as the first one, and could scarcely hurt it. But to its surprise, the series of lightning bolts were more powerful than the first one by multiple times.</p> <p>Because of the zombie king’s carelessness, Wu Chengyue’s lightning bolts struck right on its head.</p> <p>Watching the smoky zombie king falling off the building, Wu Chengyue raised both hands once again. Following his move, the lightning sphere shrank and fell along with it.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>The zombie king smashed into the zombie crowd along with the lightning sphere and black smoke, killing a few ordinary zombies.</p> <p>“Roar…Roar…oar…” However, it soon struggled back up, then roared thunderously towards the sky.</p> <p>“Roarrrrrr!” Following its rumbling roars, the zombie crowd was instantly agitated, and burst in roars as well. Next, all of them began rushing toward Wu Chengyue’s building, climbing up.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!” The zombie king struggled and screamed within the lightning sphere while the surrounding ordinary zombies went crazy. They stepped on each other’s shoulders and heads, climbing up as fast as they could.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at those zombies which were climbing up like ants, then turned and disappeared. At that moment, the zombie king suddenly uttered a raging growl.</p> <p>In the next moment, the lightning sphere which had already wrapped around its body was suddenly shattered by it with pure energy, and it sprung out swiftly. This time, it wasn’t darting toward Wu Chengyue, but toward another direction and at a higher speed.</p> <p>Just like that, it disappeared within a blink of an eye.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smilingly narrowed his eyes, then quickly followed it.</p> <p>‘Run? How can that be easy? I’m here for you.’</p> <p>The zombie king was fleeing toward the West Lake District.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao had arrived at West Lake District, and was searching for the maps she needed in all bookstores she could find. She had to at least find a map of West Lake District. Otherwise, she wouldn’t know which way to go even though she had learned that the Planning Bureau was located in this district.</p>",
  "Chapter 208: Get Involved": "<p>Lin Qiao showed up on the roof of a tall building and sat on the edge, her legs swaying in the air. A few people were standing behind her.</p> <p>Xie Dong, Lu Tianyi, Kong Qingming and Huang Shou were all let out of her space.</p> <p>She was reading a map while glancing down at the road signs. The group of people had also been searching for the Planning Bureau on a map.</p> <p>“We’ve searched this area, but didn’t find it,” Kong Qingming crossed the area that they had passed just now. Then, the group of people raised their heads to look at Lin Qiao and asked, “Where do we go next?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back and glanced at them, then reached out a hand to point at the area on the map which was next to the cross and near Lower City District.</p> <p>That was their next destination.</p> <p>“This way? There’s a park.”</p> <p>“What park? There’re quite a few parks along this road.”</p> <p>“Whatever it is, just stay away from it.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back to look at her own map. Some mutant creatures might exist in the West Lake, not to mention the fact that the lake was surrounded by parks.</p> <p>‘Maybe I can find some mutant plants and get Viney a few plant energy nuclei,’ she thought.</p> <p>Right at that moment, she suddenly raised her head and stood up, facing the Upper City District.</p> <p>“What happened?” Seeing that, one of the others asked with surprise.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had her back toward them. She took off her sunglasses and slightly narrowed her eyes as she kept gazing in that direction. Then, she saw two spheres of purple energy moving toward her one after another, at a rather high speed.</p> <p>Then, she opened her eyes and put on the sunglasses.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi, Kong Qingming and Huang Shou had been staring at the lower part of the back of Lin Qiao’s head, and found that the area was bald. The hat covered the top of her head, but not where they were looking.</p> <p>‘Why doesn’t she have hair?’ They wondered.</p> <p>Before noticing that bald area, Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming thought that Lin Qiao’s hair was hiding in her hat. However, after some observation, they found no hair from the edge of Lin Qiao’s hat. If she had covered her hair with the hat, at least some hair would be seen from the edge.</p> <p>But now, they found that Lin Qiao seemed to be bald. Did she cut her hair short? Did she shave the lower part of her head?</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao suddenly turned back and leaped off the handrail. After that, she grabbed Lu Tianyi with a hand and Kong Qingming with the other. Next, the three of them disappeared together.</p> <p>A moment later, Lin Qiao showed up alone.</p> <p>“What happened?” Huang Shou, who was left outside, asked with confusion.</p> <p>“It’s…here…” Lin Qiao glanced back at the Upper City District and said. Then, she grabbed Huang Shou and Xie Dong, bringing them into her space as well.</p> <p>“What’s here?” In the space, Huang Shou asked. The others were looking at Lin Qiao with curiosity as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked up the clipboard and wrote—’The zombie king from Upper City District.’</p> <p>“No way! How did it find out that we’re in the West Lake!” Reading that, the others were all shocked. Lin Qiao continued writing—’I don’t know if it’s here for us. But, it’s coming this way indeed.’</p> <p>She didn’t tell the group of people that apart from the zombie king, another creature was coming toward this area as well.</p> <p>What was that? Its energy was also purple in color, and seemed to be even stronger than the zombie king’s.</p> <p>Moreover, Lin Qiao found the slightly stronger energy a little familiar; she should have had sensed it before.</p> <p>She turned back to glance at the group of people. After she lured them to eat the strawberries, they picked some potatoes and pumpkins, and boiled them with the pot on the stove by the lake.</p> <p>Then, they all stuffed their stomachs.</p> <p>It seemed that they all intended to fill their stomachs even if they had to die. Lin Qiao believed that they were all thinking that way.</p> <p>They were afraid that they might be infected by the virus contained in the strawberry and turn into zombies, but couldn’t beat the hunger and the desire of eating.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and flashed out of the space in the invisible state. Then, she stood on the same spot on the roof and opened her eyes to look in that direction.</p> <p>Soon, she saw a dark and tall figure rushing over.</p> <p>It was the zombie king, but looked not quite the same as before. Earlier on, it was covered in sticky blood with its muscles exposed; but now, its color had become dark-red, and it had the smell of burnt food around it.</p> <p>It didn’t look good; it seemed to be running in haste, focusing on the creature behind it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted on the roof and put her arms around her knees while looking at the approaching zombie king with curiosity, who was followed by a great number of ordinary zombies.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw a few level-five zombies swiftly hop onto the nearby buildings and launch attacks with superpowers, along with a lot of level-four zombies. They were all attacking the powerful being which was chasing behind the zombie king.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had a familiar feeling from this creature, but she just couldn’t pinpoint it.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie king uttered a great roar, following which, the surrounding ordinary zombies immediately crowded toward that man.</p> <p>Yes, Lin Qiao had already sensed that the creature was a man, a very powerful man. She also sensed his familiar power, and the familiar lightning bolts.</p> <p>‘Isn’t that the little one’s father? No wonder I felt familiar when he was still far away. I’ve suffered his lightning, so how can I forget?’ She thought.</p> <p>No wonder the zombie king was running. There was indeed a power difference between a level-seven superpowered human being and a level-six zombie king.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue easily defended himself from the attacks of those level-four and five zombies. He wasn’t slowed down by those lower level zombies at all, and soon caught up with the zombie king.</p> <p>“Roar!” As Wu Chengyue got closer and closer, the zombie king was agitated. Meanwhile, three level-five zombies were following behind the zombie king. As their attacks had failed to harm Wu Chengyue, they suddenly climbed onto a roof and dove down toward him under the orders of the zombie king.</p> <p>Their superpowers didn’t work, so they were prepared to start a close combat against him.</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao watched these zombies quickly hop onto the building and risk their own lives to charge at Wu Chengyue with great interest.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue released a series of lightning balls which each hit a zombie. However, more and more zombies emerged constantly.</p> <p>While leaping onto one roof from another, Wu Chengyue glanced down at the zombie crowd, then carelessly swung an arm toward the zombie king which was hundreds of meters away. With that, a giant bolt of lightning struck right at the zombie king.</p>",
  "Chapter 209: Steal the Monster": "<p>“Roar!” The zombie king which had sensed the danger suddenly turned and charged at where Lin Qiao was.</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Chengyue’s lightning bolt struck down and left a hole in a two-story building. Lin Qiao looked at the hole on the roof, which was about a meter in radius, guessing that the zombie king’s lightning could strike off a corner of the building at most.</p> <p>However, seeing the zombie king rushing at her, she lost her interest in staying where she was and keep watching the fight.</p> <p>She turned and jumped off, then suddenly thrust her feet against the building and sent herself up to the roof of another building. In less than five seconds after Lin Qiao left the first building, the zombie king hopped on it, and soon leaped toward another direction.</p> <p>Soon after that, a lightning ball fell on the roof.</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>‘So close,’ Lin Qiao sighed on another roof.</p> <p>The zombie king seemed to be infuriated as it turned and reached its arms toward Wu Chengyue. Following a series of rumbling thunder, the sky darkened, and then a faint wave of lightning bolts fell toward the latter’s head.</p> <p>Seeing that, Wu Chengyue had no choice but to stop moving. He stood on a utility pole as he raised his head to look at the lightning bolts falling from the sky, then raised both hands and created a web of lightning himself.</p> <p>Just as he finished, the wave of lightning bolts fell on the web. Waves of thunderous noise could be heard from the sky while energies collided against each other, stirring the air and generating a strong gust of wind. Sands and stones were sent into the sky, along with the surrounding ordinary zombies.</p> <p>Both Wu Chengyue and the zombie king had thunder power, yet Wu Chengyue couldn’t absorb the zombie king’s lightning, because the energy contained in those lightning bolts was controlled by the latter. The zombie king’s energy was violent, and was unable to merge with his lightning.</p> <p>If the zombie king’s lightning struck his body, some serious damage would be caused for sure.</p> <p>Superpowered creatures could only absorb energies through energy nuclei, but not by any other means. Even the creatures with the same type of power couldn’t absorb each other’s energy directly. The energy nuclei in question included crystal nuclei, zombie nuclei, and the nuclei of mutant animals and plants.</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue stopped moving, the zombie king turned and fled toward West Lake. Lin Qiao quietly followed behind the zombie king to see where it was heading to. Judging by the look of Wu Chengyue, he didn’t seem ready to let the zombie king go.</p> <p>How could he ever give up on the zombie nucleus of the level-six zombie thunder-powered king?</p> <p>‘That man doesn’t look silly,’ thought Lin Qiao. And as she had reckoned, after creating the lightning web, Wu Chengyue immediately turned into a shred of shadow and darted at the zombie king.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, he was even faster than Lin Qiao.</p> <p>He was at about ten meters away from Lin Qiao, following behind the zombie king side by side with her. However, only she could see him, but he hadn’t sensed her at all.</p> <p>All three of them were swift. They didn’t feel anything special, but if anyone saw them at the moment, they would see nothing but three blurry figures fleeting toward West Lake, without being able to tell if they were zombies or humans, male or female.</p> <p>Seeing more and more trees, Wu Chengyue suddenly had a hunch, then hurriedly waved a hand and threw out another lightning web toward the zombie king.</p> <p>The zombie king surely wouldn’t let itself be covered by the lightning web, so it turned and dodged.</p> <p>And like that, another battle between the man and the zombie started.</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently hopped onto a signal tower nearby and crossed her arms as she continued watching the fight. Both Wu Chengyue and the zombie king were powerful beings. Wherever they swept across, all the buildings and plants were shredded by lightning bolts.</p> <p>Lin Qiao followed the two of them and watched them fight for two whole days.</p> <p>The zombie king seemed to fall in a disadvantage, yet its body had a high strike-resistance, and it always reacted quickly. No matter what kind of attack Wu Chengyue launched, it could always manage to dodge. It had suffered once, so the smart zombie king wouldn’t let Wu Chengyue’s seemingly weak lightning bolts fall on itself again.</p> <p>By following them, Lin Qiao was affected by their powers from time to time. However, she managed to dodge timely every time.</p> <p>Anyway, she followed them so closely with a good reason. If she sneakily showed up and stole the harvest when Wu Chengyue had almost disabled the zombie king…</p> <p>‘That man will be so angry! Hah!’ She thought.</p> <p>‘What level will Viney step into if I give it a level-six zombie nucleus? Will it be able to fix my body further? Or upgrade itself? Even if I don’t need the energy, I can use it for upgrading Xie Dong and Junjun.’ She thought.</p> <p>With these thoughts, Lin Qiao had been following the two and waiting to collect the zombie nucleus. Meanwhile, Wu Chengyue had no idea that an invisible creature had her eyes on the zombie nucleus that he had been making efforts for.</p> <p>The zombie king too wasn’t aware of the fact that apart from this powerful human being before its eyes, the zombie that he had scared off earlier was staring at it covetously as well.</p> <p>“Roar!” Some of the zombie king’s muscles were burned by the lightning and fell from its body. Its muscles were filled with energy as well. So, as more and more of its muscles fell off under Wu Chengyue’s attacks, the zombie king became less nimble than before.</p> <p>Its head was still attached to its neck, but an arm of it had been lost, and a hole was left on its waist.</p> <p>It had been running toward the park beside West Lake. If it didn’t know that this area was full of mutant animals and plants, and if it wasn’t smart enough to use those mutant creatures to stall Wu Chengyue for a few times, it would have been killed long ago.</p> <p>At the moment, Wu Chengyue didn’t look good either. Many wounds were left on his body, and even his handsome face had a few tiny scratches on it.</p> <p>He gasped quickly for air, standing on a sculpture in the park. About ten meters before him, the zombie king was crawling forward on all fours.</p> <p>‘Roar…’ The zombie king weakly moved forward while growing. At that moment, another wave of rumbling thunder was heard. These days, thunder had been echoing across this area, even scaring off quite some animals.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue swung his arm and brought down a giant bolt of lightning that violently landed on the zombie king’s body, pressing it to the ground and disabling it from moving.</p> <p>At that same time, a puff of black smoke rose.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t dare to get close to the zombie king right now, as he wasn’t sure if it had died or not. However, even though he didn’t move, the air was stirred abruptly. After that, the zombie king’s head was suddenly cut off by some unknown creature, and then disappeared within a blink!</p> <p>The zombie king’s head disappeared right before his eyes!</p>",
  "Chapter 210: Give It To Me If You Don’t Want It": "<p>The stunned Wu Chengyue stared at the headless zombie king and blinked.</p> <p>Its head was gone!</p> <p>He blinked again.</p> <p>The head was still gone!</p> <p>He raised a hand to rub his eyes, closed his eyes and pressed the root of his nose, then opened them again.</p> <p>The head was still not there!</p> <p>He darted to the zombie king and kicked its skeleton-like body, then squatted beside its neck and reached out to touch its neatly cut neck. However, seeing the dark sticky blood slowly flowing on the ground, he took back his hand.</p> <p>“Damn!” Usually, Wu Chengyue was a nice and smiling man, but now, he couldn’t help but curse with a dark face.</p> <p>He had spent two whole days to hunt the zombie king, but when it was at its last breath, someone else took its life and harvested the treasure. Anyone would be pissed off under this kind of situation!</p> <p>And, most importantly, the one who took his treasure was invisible! He didn’t even see her face!</p> <p>He didn’t even know who she was!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stood up, took a few deep breaths to try to ease his anger.</p> <p>‘Breathe! Breathe!’ He told himself, ‘Breathe…Breathe my a*s! Damn!’</p> <p>If there was a table before him, it would have been sent into the sky.</p> <p>‘Who the hell is it! I’ll find it and kill it!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao hid so well that even Wu Chengyue, a level-seven superpowered human being, sensed nothing!</p> <p>‘It has space power,’ thought Wu Chengyue. Just now, he saw a figure flash next to the zombie’s head, and in the next moment, the zombie head disappeared.</p> <p>The creature moved extremely fast, yet he still saw a figure.</p> <p>‘It showed up and disappeared again immediately, meaning it definitely has a space.’</p> <p>‘Who on earth is it? It must be at level-six or seven,’ he thought. Superpowered creatures at or below level-five could never hide from him.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Qiao carried the zombie head, flashed into her space. She didn’t look at the others, but stood by the lake with her eyes closed to observe Wu Chengyue’s reaction. Soon, she curved her lips in a smile.</p> <p>As she had spent two days out there, the other all turned to her with surprise and curiosity when she suddenly showed up. Then, they noticed the black thing carried in her hand.</p> <p>As they looked closer at that thing, they realized what it was.</p> <p>“Oh my, that’s a zombie head, isn’t it?”</p> <p>“Eh? Why does it look a little familiar?”</p> <p>“Damn! Isn’t that the zombie king’s head?”</p> <p>At last, Liu Jing recognized the zombie head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened her eyes and smilingly glanced at them, then raised the zombie head and suddenly inserted two fingers into it.</p> <p>Puff! Her fingers poked into the zombie head like steel blades.</p> <p>Then, she stirred her fingers in the zombie’s brain and pulled them out. A litchi-sized purple nucleus was held between her two fingers, glowing with a dazzling purple light.</p> <p>The nucleus was still stained by some sticky and brown matter.</p> <p>Lin Qiao threw the zombie king’s head on the ground, then walked to the bucket and fetched some water with the scoop to throw the nucleus into it.</p> <p>Plop!</p> <p>As the nucleus fell into the water, the dirty matter immediately melted.</p> <p>The group of human beings didn’t notice that a long vine had crawled out of the water, quietly reaching to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>When the zombie king was disabled from moving by Wu Chengyue, Lin Qiao had sensed that its vibe was gone for good, which meant it was already dead. That was why she dove down immediately, cut off its head, and brought it into her space.</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue didn’t approach the zombie king immediately, she understood that he wasn’t sure if it were really dead or not. So, she made the move before him.</p> <p>If she didn’t, she would never have a better opportunity.</p> <p>The washed level-six zombie nucleus was shining with a bright purple light, appearing extremely captivating. The group of people had rarely seen a zombie nucleus in this color, so they all fixed their eyes on it while quietly coming closer to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“The light, so beautiful. How dazzling it will be if it’s under the sunlight?’</p> <p>“Is this what a level-six zombie nucleus look like? I think I’ve heard about it. The colors of level-six zombie nuclei are related to the energies it contains. I think purple is the color of thunder power.”</p> <p>When they expected Lin Qiao to absorb the zombie nucleus, they saw her pour the dirty water on the ground, then drop the scoop and walk to the lakeside before throwing it into the lake.</p> <p>“What!”</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>“Damn! What’s wrong? Sister, you can give it to me if you don’t want it! Why did you throw it into the lake!”</p> <p>The group of people were all dumbfounded. They just couldn’t understand why Lin Qiao threw the nucleus into the lake instead of absorbing it. Lu Tianyi ran to her side and stared at the faint ripples created by the zombie nucleus with disbelief.</p> <p>Then, he turned to look at Lin Qiao as if she was psycho while yelling, “Are you okay? Isn’t that a level-six zombie nucleus! Even if it’s just a level-five one, it’s still extremely precious! If you don’t want it, why didn’t you give it to us to exchange for supplies!”</p> <p>The others were all stunned. Kong Qingming raised a hand to cover his forehead.</p> <p>He didn’t understand what happened to Lu Tianyu the zombie, and began to wonder if her brain had been damaged when she turned into a zombie.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shrugged toward them with a blank face.</p> <p>Who said she didn’t want it? Giving it to Viney was as same as giving it to herself.</p> <p>Unlike the others, Xie Dong looked at the group of people with interest. He knew what existed in the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back to look at the group of people and found that they still looked dirty. There was a lake, yet they didn’t go into the water to clean themselves. At the very most, they cooked with the water in the bucket.</p> <p>‘Well…as people say, men don’t care about these things…’ she thought. She walked to the lake nearby, picked the clipboard, and wrote—’You should fetch some water with the bucket to clean yourselves. Don’t you know that you stink?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed that these people’ body conditions had turned better than before because they had drunk the lake water. However, she didn’t know if they were aware of that yet.</p> <p>Perhaps, they only knew that their powers were coming back, but hadn’t noticed that they now felt much more comfortable than before.</p> <p>Reading Lin Qiao’s handwriting, the group of people all showed embarrassed looks.</p> <p>“Sister, we wanted to bath in the lake, but Xie Dong said that the lake isn’t safe, and didn’t allow us,’ said Huang Zhou.</p> <p>‘Who said to go down into the lake? I just told you that you can fetch some water from the lake and shower’—wrote Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Eh…That’s right…Why didn’t we think of that?” Huang Shou asked aloud. While speaking, he abruptly turned to look at the others.</p> <p>At that moment, Lu Tianyi said, “Who dares to do that without your permission? What if you suddenly showed up while we were showering? Will you be responsible for us and marry us all?”</p>",
  "Chapter 211: Another one?": "<p>Lin Qiao glanced at Lu Tianyi with surprise. She didn’t think that he would flirt with her!</p> <p>She didn’t believe that they were so close to each other. How could he make a joke like that?</p> <p>Besides, she didn’t mind marrying all of them. The problem was—were they brave enough to marry a zombie?</p> <p>Kong Qingming coughed slightly and said, “This is your space, so I guess whatever we do in this place, you’ll know, right?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked up the clipboard, then nodded and wrote—’Are you afraid that I might see your bodies?’</p> <p>She now understood that this group of people were getting a little bored in her space, as they had stuffed their stomachs.</p> <p>Reading Lin Qiao’s note, Kong Qingming smiled. Seeing his handsome face wearing that evil smile, most ordinary women would lose themselves.<br/>\nWith that slightly wicked smile, he said, “We’re men, and you’re a woman. Of course, we don’t mind that. That won’t hurt us anyway.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao wrote with an expressionlessly—’Go shower then. Take off all your clothes and wash them as well.’</p> <p>Lu Tianyi felt that something wasn’t right, so he asked abruptly, “Wait a minute! Isn’t the zombie king dead? We can go out now, can’t we? And, what have you done these days out there?”</p> <p>Judging by her tone of speaking, he felt that she would keep them in this place.</p> <p>His question made Lin Qiao feel a little embarrassed. She couldn’t tell them that she just stole their Chief’s treasure, could she? If she let them out now, Wu Chengyue would definitely sense them, and soon after that, he would find them and ask the questions.</p> <p>If that happened, she would be exposed, wouldn’t she?</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then made up a story—’There’s another zombie king out there.’</p> <p>“What! Another one! Wasn’t this the only one?” Hearing that, the group of people immediately wore bitter faces.</p> <p>No way! Another one! The first one had nearly killed them, and now there was another one!</p> <p>Liu Jing blinked and asked, “Perhaps, the two zombie kings were fighting and you suddenly showed up when the thunder-powered one was killed…Sister, you didn’t steal this zombie head, did you?</p> <p>Hearing that, the others immediately looked at Lin Qiao with a different expression. If that were true, they would be eaten alive by the other zombie king once they went out.</p> <p>Lin Qiao paused briefly, then quietly glanced at Liu Jing, admiring his imagination. What he imagined was almost the same as the truth, but with a different character.</p> <p>The one she stole from wasn’t a zombie, but what would happen to these people wouldn’t be any better if they left the space now.</p> <p>She raised a hand to give Liu Jing a thumbs-up.</p> <p>The others cried in one voice, “No! You just challenged a zombie king, so how can you offend another one right after that?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently turned her head. But soon, she carelessly shrugged and wrote—’What am I afraid of? If I want to leave, no one will know.’</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was out there, but didn’t she leave without making the slightest noise?</p> <p>…</p> <p>Meanwhile on the outside, Wu Chengyue sat on a branch of a tall tree with his eyes closed, waiting quietly. He believed that the thief would definitely show up again. Even though he didn’t see Lin Qiao’s face, he caught her vibe which was released within one moment, and had memorized it!</p> <p>He sharpened his sensations as much as possible. Once she showed up within the area five miles in radius around him, he would be able to sense her instantly.</p> <p>However, he didn’t know that Xiao Yunlong and the others who were waiting for him in Binjiang District were now in trouble.</p> <p>A figure was approaching them; it wasn’t tall, only about five feet, and quite skinny.</p> <p>It looked like a fourteen-year-old girl with short hair. Even though it still looked like a human being, its movements were abnormal.</p> <p>Half of her face was thickly covered in small scales, and so were her claws and bared feet.</p> <p>Her eyes were faint green, with erect pupils within.</p> <p>Those eyes were similar to the eyes of snakes, but not exactly the same. Dense black circles were under those eyes, looking like the eyes of pandas.</p> <p>She was in a clean school uniform. Her upper body was wearing a white shirt, and lower body was covered with a knee-length black skirt. Her exposed lower legs looked smooth, and the scales on her knees were sparkling faintly.</p> <p>A long tail reached out of her skirt, wagging along with her leaping movements.</p> <p>She wasn’t wearing any shoes. She couldn’t even if she wanted, because her toes were crooked and with sharp, hook-shaped nails. Any shoes would be torn by those nails.</p> <p>Despite her scary and weird look, her green eyes were filled with confusion and dullness, nothing else.</p> <p>Abruptly, she paused on a tree on the roadside, put one hand on the tree, and sniffed around. After that, the confusion and dullness in her eyes were replaced by curiosity and interest.</p> <p>She smiled as she happily leaped off the tree and began running on the road. She had sensed some nice aromas, and recognized it as the scent of human beings. The aromas told her that some human beings were nearby.</p> <p>Among those scents, she sensed two different kinds of natural and refreshing aromas which made her feel so comfortable! She liked those especially!</p> <p>The closer she got, the brighter her eyes shone.</p> <p>Not far away from her, Xiao Yunlong and his people were resting in an abandoned residential area. They had cleaned off the zombies inside one building and found some relatively clean rooms to rest in.</p> <p>At the moment, there was nothing for them to worry about, as all the zombies in the building had been killed, and the door on the first floor was closed. The ordinary zombies around the building didn’t know how to open the door, left only slapping and pushing it.</p> <p>A few soldiers were guarding by the stairs behind the door. The corridor of the second floor was guarded by two squad leaders and about ten soldiers, and so was the third floor.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong was carrying Wu Yueling in a relatively tidy room he and Meng Yue had found. After his soldiers quickly cleaned the room, they walked in.</p> <p>He felt rather magical, as Wu Yueling was actually willing to be carried by him! Did she finally admit that he was her godfather?</p> <p>He was quite delighted these days, so he spent lots of time playing with her.</p> <p>“Just let me take a look! Don’t be so stingy! It’s just a grass dragonfly. Let your godfather see it. Your godfather will certainly make you a better one.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong sat in a chair, watching Wu Yueling hide the little toy behind her body and pop her big eyes as she stared at him alertly.</p> <p>Meng Yue, who sat beside Xiao Yunlong, was working hard with a few green grasses. He tried but couldn’t make the same kind of grass dragonfly. A while later, she lost her interest and threw the grasses at Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>“You try…take your time. I have failed…”</p>",
  "Chapter 212: Mutant Zombie": "<p>Before Meng Yue finished talking, her entire body froze. Next, she suddenly sprung up to shield Wu Yueling behind, staring at the door alertly.</p> <p>Seeing her movement, Xiao Yunlong stood up immediately, also looking at the closed door. He knew that Meng Yue must have sensed something behind that door.</p> <p>“What happened?”</p> <p>Meng Yue didn’t answer his question, just fixing her eyes on the door. At that moment, they heard the door handle turn and both took a step backward, keeping Wu Yueling behind them.</p> <p>Wu Yueling seemed to be affected by the two of them, quickly putting the grass dragonfly into her pocket.</p> <p>Click! The door was unlocked, then slowly pushed open. In the next instant, a relatively short figure was seen standing at the door. As the door opened, the young female zombie stuck her head in to look Meng Yue and Xiao Yunlong curiously with her green eyes.</p> <p>‘What? Only two?’</p> <p>She looked around with confusion. She had sensed the scents of three people, but why did she only see two?</p> <p>Seeing the obvious black circles under those green eyes, Meng Yue and Xiao Yunlong immediately began moving. Xiao Yunlong stepped forward and reached out both hands. Following his move, all metal objects in the room fell apart, forming a metal web and blocking the entire door.</p> <p>Meng Yue reacted swiftly as well. She turned back and bent over to scoop Wu Yueling up, then jumped out of the window behind her.</p> <p>As Wu Yueling was picked up, the weird young female zombie discovered her immediately. She stared straight at the little girl when Meng Yue darted out through the window.</p> <p>Suddenly, the young female zombie was agitated. It attempted to rush into the room, but instead of that, she bumped into Xiao Yunlong’s metal web.</p> <p>She leaned against the metal web and reached a hand into the room through it, fingers clenched toward the window. But soon, she pulled out the hand and confusedly looked at the metal web which blocked her way.</p> <p>She clenched the metal web and shook it, but it didn’t move at all.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong slowly stepped backward while staring at the young female zombie nervously but curiously. Judging by the black circles under her eyes, she was clearly a zombie. Seeing her eyes, Xiao Yunlong felt that she was powerful and very hard to deal with. Her vibe was incredibly strong, even stronger than his.</p> <p>She was a rarely seen mutant zombie! Half of her face was covered with strange scales, her eyes were green and her pupils were erect, like the pupils of snakes.</p> <p>Her claws weren’t the same as the claws of normal zombies. The hands of normal zombies still looked like human hands, but with long and sharp nails. However, this snake-eyed zombie’s claws which had clasped the metal web looked nothing like human hands, more like beast claws.</p> <p>The young female zombie tried to shake the metal web which blocked the door, but failed. After that, she took a step backward and slightly raised her claws, suddenly slapping the metal web.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Just like that, a hole was left on the sturdy metal web. She raised her claws again to continue slapping the metal web, seeming to be rather anxious as her eyes turned toward the window from time to time.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Meng Yue directly leaped from the fourth floor. After landing, she turned back to find that Xiao Yunlong had jumped off as well.</p> <p>“Take Ling Ling away! I’ll handle it…” Xiao Yunlong turned around to look at the window once he landed on the ground, then raised both hands. Along with his move, the surrounding metal window frames all fell off and gathered around the window on the fourth floor to block it.</p> <p>Meng Yue didn’t waste any time talking to him and just carried Wu Yueling as she turned to run toward the yard before the building. She wanted to get to the car which was parked by the yard as quickly as possible, so she could drive and leave.</p> <p>She wasn’t capable of running far with her feet.</p> <p>As she rushed to the car with Wu Yueling, she heard a thunderous boom from behind. She turned back to look at the building and found that the soldiers guarding outside were all gone. She guessed that the strange zombie had killed them all.</p> <p>She only took a quick glance at the building while quickly opening the car door. Then, she put Wu Yueling on the front seat and ran to the driver’s seat. Next, she started the car and pressed on the accelerator; the car neatly moved backward, then turned and drove toward the outside.</p> <p>At that moment, Xiao Yunlong suddenly rushed out and hopped onto the car roof. Both him and Meng Yue were experienced enough to realize that the weird zombie was at level-six at least. So, they understood that they were no match for it.</p> <p>Right now, their most important job was to protect Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Just now, when confronting the zombie, both Xiao Yunlong and Meng Yue had sensed that it was interested in Wu Yueling, and not in themselves.</p> <p>Soon after Meng Yue started the car, a figure flashed onto the roof of the building which they stayed in earlier, then leaped toward them. Xiao Yunlong got down on one knee and patted the car roof near the driver’s seat, then slightly bent over to say to Meng Yue, “Speed up, it’s here!”</p> <p>Meng Yue had just buckled Wu Yueling up with one hand. She glanced at the rear-view mirror, then pressed harder on the accelerator.</p> <p>‘Bad luck. How can this thing show up here? Is this Wu Chengyue’s target?’ She wondered.</p> <p>‘But, it isn’t using any thunder power.’</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>Many vehicles were abandoned on the road. The driving wasn’t smooth, but thankfully, Meng Yue’s driving skill was not bad, which allowed her to keep driving forward.</p> <p>The young female zombie in school uniforms was moving much more easily than the car was. She simply leaped across car roofs, utility poles, or trees, and quickly caught up with the car.</p> <p>Fortunately, all the vehicles on the road were made of metal, perfectly providing accessories for Xiao Yunlong’s metal power. He turned back and raised both hands toward the speedily approaching zombie. Following his move, the vehicles in the surroundings all floated up, drifting toward the zombie.</p> <p>Next, Xiao Yunlong swung both arms forward and violently threw tens of cars toward the young female zombie.</p> <p>As the vehicles on the road were all lifted by Xiao Yunlong with his superpower, Meng Yue’s driving speed rose by three times. The young female zombie nimbly dodged the cars flying at her, then leaped onto the taller streetlights or utility poles nearby, with her one-meter-long tail wagging behind her body.</p>",
  "Chapter 213: Ling Ling Is Taken Away": "<p>It was now that Xiao Yunlong noticed that she had a tail, and felt quite interested.</p> <p>‘Can zombies grow tails? This creature has mutated in a strange way,’ he thought. But soon, he had no time to think about that, as the zombie had nearly caught up with him.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong fixed his eyes on her, his forehead covered in sweat drops. The vehicles on the road were lifted and thrown at the zombie one after another, generating a series of thunderous noises.</p> <p>Right at that moment, the young female zombie disappeared suddenly.</p> <p>“Eh?” Xiao Yunlong looked around alertly. ‘It’s gone…Where did it go?’</p> <p>Hearing the noise, Meng Yue abruptly stopped the car. She confusedly glanced at the rear-view mirror, then found that the zombie was gone. The road was blocked by many abandoned vehicles, so she shouted out loud, “Xiao Yunlong, open the road!”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong reached a hand backward without turning around. Following his move, the abandoned vehicles before his car were pushed to the side.</p> <p>The car had been driven miles away from the residential area, yet many ordinary zombies were attracted by the noises they made and showed up.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong stayed on the car roof for a while, but still didn’t see the zombie. He surely didn’t think that it had left. Instead, he understood that the strange young female zombie was certainly preparing for some kind of sneak attack.</p> <p>While he was thinking, a figure suddenly darted out of an alley before their car, accurately stopped before their car which was still moving forward, and raised both arms to stop it.</p> <p>Meng Yue didn’t even see how the zombie showed up. Before she could slam on the brakes, the zombie had already raised her arms toward the car.</p> <p>The car was driving at a hundred and twenty kilometers an hour. An ordinary human being would be sent to about ten meters away by it. However, the one standing before the car wasn’t a human being.</p> <p>Bang! Before Meng Yue could react, the world in her eyes began spinning.</p> <p>When Xiao Yunlong realized what had happened, both he and the car had flown away. However, he reacted fast enough to flip in the air, land on the ground, and make a roll.</p> <p>Hearing the boom, the look on his face changed drastically.</p> <p>The car had landed loudly on the ground.</p> <p>“Meng Yue! Ling Ling!” Xiao Yunlong shouted out loud, standing up and rushing toward the car in panic.</p> <p>“Ling Ling! Meng Yue! Meng Yue!” He darted to the car and shouted toward a window. The car lied on the ground upside-down, and so was Meng Yue.</p> <p>“Em…” Meng Yue moaned in the driver’s seat. Her body was covered in wounds, and her head was bleeding. Her brows were knitted, eyes closed tightly. Hearing Xiao Yunlong’s voice, she made a little reaction.</p> <p>“Meng Yue! How do you feel! Meng Yue! Ling Ling…Where’s Ling Ling? Why isn’t Ling Ling here?” Looking through the car window and seeing Meng Yue’s head covered in blood, Xiao Yunlong was startled, and then found that the front seat was empty.</p> <p>Wu Yueling had disappeared.</p> <p>With his whole body soaked in cold sweat, Xiao Yunlong got Meng Yue out of the car and found that she wasn’t injured severely, having just fainted. What made him feel despairing was that Wu Yueling disappeared, and so did the zombie.</p> <p>Without a doubt, Wu Yueling was taken away by the zombie.</p> <p>What should he do? Where should he find the level-five zombie now? Meng Yue was injured, and she needed someone to take care of her.</p> <p>Ling Ling was taken away by a level-six zombie, a zombie queen. Higher level zombies loved to eat the hearts of children and women the most! Wu Yueling was taken away by the zombie, and the chance for her to survive barely existed.</p> <p>How should he explain to Wu Chengyue? Even if he found the zombie queen now, how should he take Ling Ling back from her? Not to mention the fact that he didn’t even know where the zombie had gone. How should he find Ling Ling?</p> <p>With no other choice, he needed to wait for Meng Yue to wake up and sense Ling Ling’s location. He lifted her expressionlessly and walked toward the clearing nearby.</p> <p>Bang! As he got a few meters away, the car exploded. A dense puff of smoke rose after a burst of red fire.</p> <p>On the other side, the zombie carried Wu Yueling, swiftly running toward West Lake. After a short while of running, she stopped on the roof of a building.</p> <p>The young female zombie carefully put the fainted Wu Yueling on the ground and let her lean against the wall.</p> <p>She remembered nothing, nothing at all. But still, she understood that she couldn’t eat human beings. After becoming like this, she had been traveling around. She liked travel instead of staying in one place.</p> <p>She didn’t know a lot. She had no idea what zombies were, but did know what humans were. She was also aware of the fact that she wasn’t a human being anymore.</p> <p>Who was she? That, she didn’t remember.</p> <p>She liked the scent of living human beings, because they smelled nice. She really wanted to take a bite of a living human being, so she wouldn’t feel so hungry. However, she clearly knew that she couldn’t eat human beings. She didn’t know why, but a voice in her head had been telling her that.</p> <p>She never liked to be alone, and wanted a company. However, all human beings were afraid of her. They would either attack her or run away at the sight of her.</p> <p>And those walking dead people weren’t the same as living human beings. They smelled awful, and they were ugly and dirty. Hence, she didn’t like getting close to them.</p> <p>Their limbs were broken, yet they could still walk; some of them had holes in their stomachs, but they could still move.</p> <p>Instinctively, she didn’t like them.</p> <p>So, she traveled alone. In fact, she liked to stay around human bases and observe human beings. She really wanted to go inside and be with them.<br/>\nHowever, she knew that all those people were afraid of her. But, why? Why were they afraid of her? She never hurt anyone.</p> <p>The young female zombie squatted before Wu Yueling and put her arms around her crooked knees, looking at Wu Yueling’s little face with confusion.</p> <p>‘A kid, so little, so cute!’ She had traveled out here for long, but this was the first time for her to see such a little kid. She observed Wu Yueling, curiously reached out her hand to try and touch the latter’s face. However, before touching Wu Yueling, she suddenly paused.</p> <p>Glancing at her sharp claws, she silently took her hand back. She knew that they might be poisonous.</p>",
  "Chapter 214: She Didn’t Deny": "<p>She often saw living human beings being bitten or scratched by those walking dead. Those human beings would die, then become walking corpses themselves and wander in the world.</p> <p>She didn’t know if she would turn the others into zombies too, but she felt that she was almost the same as those walking dead.</p> <p>But now, she had company! She wanted to keep Wu Yueling, and she believed that she would take good care of her.</p> <p>She didn’t think whether the child’s family would worry, neither considered what she should feed her with. She felt that the things which were edible for herself were also edible for the child.</p> <p>She was so happy now because she didn’t need to go everywhere alone anymore. Before, she was only able to hide in the places that human beings couldn’t find, and curiously watch them. But now, with the child, she wouldn’t be bored to the point where she had nothing to do but count the ants by the road.</p> <p>While observing Wu Yueling, the look on her face changed slightly. Then, she glanced at the sky and carefully scooped Wu Yueling as she turned and left.</p> <p>It was going to rain. She knew that the rain would be so, so cold. So, she carried Wu Yueling while moving toward West Lake.</p> <p>The West Lake area was her temporary territory. She hoped that the giant creature from Upper City District wouldn’t go to her place while she wasn’t there.</p> <p>However, she had no idea that the child’s father was in that area now.</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao saw a vine draw back into the lake after she threw the zombie nucleus into the water, and smiled.</p> <p>‘So impatient!’ She thought. The vine showed up silently because it sensed the energy contained in the zombie nucleus. Anyway, only she noticed the vine coming out of the lake.</p> <p>A couple of minutes after the zombie nucleus was thrown into the water, Lin Qiao sensed the change of the energy in the lake. The underwater energy waves hadn’t yet reached up to the lake surface, but she clearly sensed them. She realized that two streams of energies were merging into one.</p> <p>One of the two was the energy of the lake, which she was familiar with. It used to be gentle, but not anymore. Meanwhile, the other stream of energy was violent, belonging to the zombie king.</p> <p>Perhaps, Viney’s energy was agitated by the zombie king’s violent energy.</p> <p>The two streams of power swirled in the lake: one was devouring the other, and the other was fighting back. Some of the others had sensed the energy waved down in the lake, but not as clearly as Lin Qiao had.</p> <p>With confusion, Lu Tianyi walked to her side and asked, “Is there…something in your lake?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him, then at Kong Qingming, who followed behind him. ‘These two boys are quite sensitive. They both sensed the energies, even though their powers have only restored by about thirty percent,’ she thought.</p> <p>Xie Dong walked over silently as well, looking at the lake. The dangerous feeling that he got from the lake was getting stronger and stronger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming again. She didn’t nod, but handed Xie Dong the clipboard and said, “I…go…out, you…”</p> <p>While speaking, she pointed at their clothes, then at the bucket.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming glanced at each other and understood her meaning. After that, Lin Qiao closed her eyes and disappeared from the lakeside.</p> <p>Then, Lu Tianyi asked Xie Dong, “I have one question…”</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at him as the former smiled in a strange way and said, “Did Lu Tianyu lose her hair?”</p> <p>“Hehe…” Kong Qingming couldn’t help but laugh.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi threw a glance at him, then turned back to Xie Dong. Both of them had noticed that a while ago. However, as Lin Qiao wore the hat and sunglasses all the time, they thought that she might feel embarrassed if they asked her the question.</p> <p>Nevertheless, they were really curious! Picturing the bald Lu Tianyu, sometimes with her old face with thick makeup, sometimes without makeup, and sometimes with zombie eyes, Lu Tianyi felt like both crying and laughing.</p> <p>He tried to imagine the expression that she must have had on finding herself bald. He believed that she must have cursed the world with the worst language she knew.</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at them and remained silent for seven or eight seconds, then nodded. He was a little surprised while looking at Lu Tianyi, as he found that the latter seemed to care a lot about Lin Qiao…no, about Lu Tianyu. Lu Tianyi had yet to find out that Lu Tianyu the zombie had a different soul now.</p> <p>‘Is this handsome man in secret love with Lu Tianyu?’ Xie Dong wondered, ‘That woman has a secret suitor? That’s a surprise.’</p> <p>‘Do you care about her?’—Xie Dong wrote on the clipboard.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi paused for a second, then dropped his eyelids and gave a helpless smile as he responded, “You noticed that?”</p> <p>Xie Dong speechlessly rolled his eyes. Kong Qingming did the same thing, then said, “I didn’t want to say this, but you’ve been paying attention to her the whole time. Haven’t you felt that she has changed a lot? To be honest, I have even started to think if you’re wrong.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi paused again, his eyes fixed on the lake surface.</p> <p>Of course, he had felt that. How could he not? He felt the difference since the day he met her. He started doubting himself long ago, but the problem was that she had admitted, hadn’t she?</p> <p>She didn’t deny that she was Lu Tianyu.</p> <p>“I know, but she didn’t deny.”</p> <p>Kong Qingming remained silent for a while, then said, “Whatever! I think no one but us can recognize her at the moment.” While speaking, he turned to look at the others. Xie Dong glanced at them and didn’t join their conversation, walking to the daily supply area instead and finding a few buckets.</p> <p>Because of the lake, Lin Qiao had collected quite some buckets of different sizes for future use. Before she left the hotel, she had filled all the large buckets in the hotel with the lake water for Lin Feng and his people to use. She had left about thirty bucketfuls of water in the hotel.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After exiting her space, Lin Qiao calmly glanced at Wu Chengyue who was sitting on the tree without sensing anything. Giving a proud smile, she turned and left.</p> <p>It was a little unkind for her to seize his zombie nucleus, but she did that to take her revenge for striking her with a lightning bolt due to no reason. She hadn’t forgotten that! Even though she took the little one away, didn’t she give her back to him at last? And she served as a nanny for so many days!</p> <p>She saw the zombie nucleus as her payment for taking care of his child.</p>",
  "Chapter 215: Indescribable Connection": "<p>Wu Chengyue had no idea that Lin Qiao had left, so he just kept waiting there. Meanwhile, Lin Qiao found a building and climbed onto the roof to observe the sky. She found that the moisture in the air had become heavier, and the dark clouds in the sky were getting denser and denser.</p> <p>It was going to rain.</p> <p>That would be her first rain after the apocalypse. From Lu Tianyu’s memories, she learned that once the rain started, the temperature would drop drastically.</p> <p>However, she was only afraid of the heat, and not the coldness.</p> <p>As she prepared to leap off the building and continue looking for the Planning Bureau, she paused suddenly and looked around with confusion.<br/>\nThen, she closed her eyes and sharpened her sensations as much as possible.</p> <p>She caught a strange feeling. It wasn’t like the feeling she had from Lu Tianyi, but was similar to the feeling that Xie Dong gave her earlier on.</p> <p>To be honest, she was yet to figure out what exactly the weird connection between her and Xie Dong was. Lu Tianyi was Lu Tianyu’s brother, so the two of them were probably connected by bloodline. However, Xie Dong and she weren’t related at all.</p> <p>She closed her eyes to carefully sense the strange feeling, then sensed a strong vibe which belonged to a zombie.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and showed a bitter look as she couldn’t help but complain in her head—’Damn! Why are there so many zombie kings and queens? Who said that zombie kings and queens are extremely rare? This is my second month in this post-apocalyptic world, yet I had already met two of them…And now, the third one has shown up!”</p> <p>She automatically tried to turn away from that direction, but that strange feeling was also coming from that place, and she did care about that feeling.</p> <p>It was Xie Dong the last time, so who was it this time? Whoever it was, that person was with a level-six zombie. The zombie’s vibe was unfamiliar, meaning that she didn’t know that zombie.</p> <p>So, why was that person with a level-six zombie?</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that not every zombie king or queen was as nice and kind as Qiu Lili. Normally, level-six zombies would be like that thunder-powered one.</p> <p>That person was with a level-six zombie, so, was he or she captured and kept as preserved food?</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood on the roof and frowned, then sighed silently. If she didn’t have that strange feeling, she wouldn’t try finding that level-six zombie. But now, the feeling had occurred, and if she didn’t figure it out, she would feel uneasy.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then leaped off the building and moved toward the zombie king.</p> <p>She was invisible, so she could scarcely be harmed. Therefore, she decided to go and take a look. If it weren’t too late, she would save that person, and if it were too late…she needed to at least figure out what exactly was going on, who exactly that person was, and what the strange connection between that person and herself was.</p> <p>With these thoughts, Lin Qiao moved faster and faster.</p> <p>The sky was covered by dark clouds. These were natural dark clouds, not the ones created by the zombie king. At the same time, the wind grew stronger and stronger, roaring thunderously.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t sense the dropping temperature, but Wu Chengyue could. He opened his eyes to look at the sky. Even though he was still protected by his energy, he didn’t want to be soaked by the rain.</p> <p>Since it was going to rain, he couldn’t stay in the park.</p> <p>He stood up from the branch and jumped off the tree, turning to walk toward the nearby buildings.</p> <p>On the other side, Xiao Yunlong guarded by Meng Yue’s side, anxiously pacing like a trapped bear.</p> <p>He wanted to find Wu Yueling as soon as possible, but he didn’t know where to go. If he took the wrong direction, he would go further away from her and the level-six zombie. Even if he found Ling Ling and the zombie right now, he wouldn’t be able to take her back. However, he needed to know where she was at least.</p> <p>Even if the zombie killed the little Ling Ling and ate her heart, he would need to bring her body back!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was too far away from then, so he couldn’t inform him about what had happened.</p> <p>What should he do? He really didn’t know what to do!</p> <p>Meng Yue was injured and unconscious. The longer she slept, the further away would Wu Yueling and the zombie get.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong’s eyes turned red as he scratched his scalp again.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her speed toward the level-six zombie. When she was only a few miles away from it, she suddenly paused on top of a signal tower.<br/>\nShe raised her nose to sniff at the air, then her face showed both surprise and hesitation.</p> <p>That scent…That scent belonged to…</p> <p>‘The little one!’</p> <p>Once she confirmed that the scent belonged to the little one who was parted from her for over twenty days, she couldn’t help but get mad.</p> <p>How could that man bring the kid to such a dangerous place!</p> <p>Without hesitation, she sprung up from the signal tower and darted at the level-six zombie at an even higher speed.</p> <p>‘Please do not be too late!’</p> <p>Miles away before her, in a tens of stories high building by a street, all the zombies had been evicted. A powerful level-six zombie was standing on the roof, so which ordinary zombie dared to linger there?</p> <p>In a large suite on the top floor, the scaled young female zombie put Wu Yueling on the bed. The bed was large, with pillows and blankets on it. However, everything was covered in a thick layer of dust. It seemed that no one lived here before the apocalypse.</p> <p>The young female zombie didn’t clean the bed, but directly put Wu Yueling into the blanket. Then, she squatted by the bed, her head resting on her palms. She looked at the few wounds on Wu Yueling’s little face, which had stopped bleeding.</p> <p>While looking at Wu Yueling, the young female zombie had also been sniffing at her.</p> <p>‘She smells so good! So comfortable!’</p> <p>Abruptly, she reached out a hand, crooked her finger, and touched the blood on Wu Yueling’s wounds. Then, she took her hand back while gazing at the sticky blood.</p> <p>It smelled really nice and sweet.</p> <p>At that moment, the young female zombie cherishingly looked at Wu Yueling as if she were a sweet candy.</p> <p>She wanted to eat the little thing, but she couldn’t bear to.</p> <p>Lin Qiao soon arrived, looked into the window of this large suite. She saw a young female zombie in clean high-school uniform squatting by the bedside, looking at Wu Yueling who was lying on the bed, seeming to be delighted.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was unconscious, but her life-force stayed strong. It seemed that she hadn’t suffered serious harm.</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao noticed the young female zombie’s slightly wagging tail.</p> <p>‘Damn! What kind of zombie is this?’</p> <p>When Lin Qiao was thinking with curiosity, the young female zombie suddenly turned to look at the window, as if she had sensed something.</p> <p>It was at that moment Lin Qiao found that half of the young female zombie’s face was covered in scales!</p>",
  "Chapter 216 - Where Was The Child From": "<p>The young female zombie confusedly looked at the window with her big eyes that had thick black circles under them. She didn’t see anything, so she turned back and kept looking at Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao quietly got into the room through the window, which thankfully wasn’t closed.</p> <p>‘What type of power does this green-eyed zombie have?’ Lin Qiao looked at this zombie curiously, feeling that it was quite strange. Her vibe was strong indeed, but she didn’t show any sign of attacking. Instead, her strong vibe was natural and peaceful. More importantly, Lin Qiao didn’t detect any scent of blood from this zombie, or ferocity or hostility which normal high-level zombies would have.</p> <p>The zombie was looking at Wu Yueling in a strange way, like a child looking at a toy. It seemed like she had just attained a new and interesting toy.</p> <p>‘What’s happening? She doesn’t seem about to eat Wu Yueling,’ Lin Qiao thought as sneakily got close to Wu Yueling and observed her. She found that the child was still adorable, but with a few new wounds on her face.<br/>\n‘How did she get hurt?’</p> <p>The wounds had just stopped bleeding. It seemed that the child was injured not long ago.</p> <p>At that moment, the young female zombie looked around the room, her face filled with confusion. Then, she stood up and looked around again.</p> <p>Somehow, she felt that something had gotten into this room</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her with surprise. This zombie was so sensitive that she even sensed the invisible Lin Qiao.</p> <p>But soon, Lin Qiao turned away from her, pressed a hand on Wu Yueling’s forehead, and said a word in her head.</p> <p>‘In.’</p> <p>After that, she and Wu Yueling entered her space together. Once the two disappeared, the young female zombie suddenly turned back her head. At that moment, Wu Yueling was gone.</p> <p>She blinked, then realized that Wu Yueling was truly gone. Even the nice aroma of hers had disappeared.</p> <p>“Roar?” The young female zombie popped her green eyes. Her erect pupils shrank into a pair of thin lines as she stared at the empty bed.</p> <p>On entering her space, Lin Qiao hurriedly caught the little one who fell from the air. Then, she closed her eyes to observe the young female zombie’s reaction.</p> <p>The zombie stood by the bedside stunned, gazing where Wu Yueling had been lying just now. Then, she slowly approached the bed and reached out a hand to touch the pillow.</p> <p>“Er…..errrrr…whooo…” Suddenly, the zombie curved her lips downward, twisted her face, and began crying. Her crying voice was very weird, yet her sadness was strong.</p> <p>‘Eh? What on earth is happening?’</p> <p>Before Lin Qiao realized what had happened, she saw the young female zombie turn and sit onto the bed, then burst in tears while waving her arms and kicking her legs.</p> <p>“Whaaaaa…”</p> <p>‘Why is she acting like a child whose toy is stolen?’ Lin Qiao thought. This young female zombie’s reaction quickly reminded Lin Qiao of Qiu Lili, and made her feel a little speechless.</p> <p>‘Why is this zombie like Qiu Lili so much? They aren’t sisters, are they? They look at the same age,’ she thought.</p> <p>‘No way. Did I run into the second Qiu Lili?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao lowered her head to glance at the little one who was lying in her arms, then thought with surprise. Then, she decided to put the little one on the bed and fetch some water for her to drink. However, once she turned around, she saw a group of naked men crowding together, staring at her with indescribable looks…</p> <p>Lin Qiao was speechless again.</p> <p>In fact, they weren’t entirely naked. At least, they were all wearing underpants.</p> <p>“Sis-sister! Didn’t you say that you won’t come in for a while!” Liu Jing said to her embarrassedly. He covered his chest with one hand and crotch area with the other, legs squeezed together and eyes widened.</p> <p>Xie Dong stood aside as he couldn’t help but snort with laughter, hurriedly covering his mouth with a hand. Lin Qiao speechlessly glanced at him, then calmly walked to the bed.</p> <p>Huang Shou kicked Liu Jing while saying, “Are you a girl? Why did you make this pose?”</p> <p>The others didn’t react so dramatically, only watching Lin Qiao with a strange look.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi stared at the little one in Lin Qiao’s arms and elbowed Kong Qingming as he said with a low voice, “Is that our little princess?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming had also widened his eyes. After watching Lin Qiao walk to the bed, he nodded and responded, “Yes, I’m not blind.”</p> <p>Then, they glanced at each other.</p> <p>So, what happened?</p> <p>“Can I ask who’s she carrying? Where is that kid from?” Huang Shou moved to the two and asked.</p> <p>“If we’re right, that’s Ling Ling, the little princess of our base,” said Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>Hearing that, Huang Shou popped his eyes in shock and said with disbelief, “What? Ling Ling? How can that little princess be in here? And, why did the lady bring her in? Chief Wu and Deputy Chief Xiao will be driven crazy!”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi knitted her brows and shook his head. He didn’t know what had happened either.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao walked away, the group of people relaxed a little and continued cleaning themselves with wetted clothes. But from time to time, they had still been glancing at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After putting Wu Yueling on the bed, Lin Qiao immediately found a cup, walking to the lake and filling it with lake water. After that, she quickly walked back to the bed, slightly lifted Wu Yueling’s head, and poured the water into her mouth.</p> <p>Wu Yueling seemed to be thirsty. Feeling the water pouring into her mouth, she automatically swallowed it.</p> <p>The energy contained in the water had grown over ten times stronger than before, which was absorbed by the little one quickly. Lin Qiao found a hidden energy inside the little one’s body. As she drank the water, the hidden power was activated.</p> <p>She also found that the hidden power had been slowly healing the child’s injuries and nourishing her body. Once Wu Yueling swallowed the water, the healing speed was boosted by a couple of times.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised a hand to touch the tiniest wound on the little one’s forehead, then found that it had scabbed within just a couple of seconds. She gently scratched it, then the scab fell off.</p> <p>After that, she carefully touched the wound. No scar was left, and the new skin was thin, pink and sensitive.</p> <p>She took back her hand, put the cup on a cabin by the bed, then walked back to the bedside and sat down as she closed her eyes to continue observing the zombie outside.</p>",
  "Chapter 217: Save The Little One": "<p>The young female zombie had stopped crying, crooking her knees and putting her arms around them. She buried her face between her knees, looking very sad.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt quite strange. She opened her eyes to look at the little one, finding no other injuries on her body save for the few scratches on her face.</p> <p>So strange! The zombie didn’t seem to want to hurt the little one. But, why was the little one with her? Why did the zombie react like a treasure of hers was stolen when Lin Qiao took the little one away?</p> <p>She reacted like an innocent kid!</p> <p>Besides, Lin Qiao hadn’t detected any evil intention from that young zombie. Even though the little one was stolen from her, she didn’t get mad, but was crying.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought of one possibility.</p> <p>Before, she didn’t think that zombies could have humanity. However, she was forced to believe that after meeting Xie Dong, Junjun and Qiu Lili.</p> <p>‘The zombie out there might be in the same condition as Qiu Lili used to be,’ she thought.</p> <p>She sat on the bed silently while thinking, at which moment, the little one opened her eyes. Lin Qiao immediately sensed that, so she turned and looked into the little one’s confused large eyes.</p> <p>The little one stared at her for a second, then the confusion in her eyes turned into fear. The child widely opened her eyes and flinched as she sat up hurriedly and then moved backward as fast as possible.</p> <p>Seeing her reaction, Lin Qiao gave a start. But then, she hurriedly pressed a hand on the child’s shoulder, worried that the kid might fall off the bed.</p> <p>Sensing the child’s panic and helplessness, Lin Qiao understood that the kid didn’t recognize her. That was reasonable though. After all, she was now wearing a hat and a pair of sunglasses, and the scars on her face had disappeared.</p> <p>Being pressed by her, the little one froze, then began quivering. She still remembered how the car turned upside down, so, she was feeling awfully uncomfortable right now.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put a hand on her feet, and found that her entire body was tightened and still trembling. The extreme fear she had was sent into Lin Qiao’s hand from her feet.</p> <p>The little one didn’t cry, but buried her head deeper into her knees. She acted as same as when Lin Qiao saved her the first time. The kid was almost having a mental breakdown.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t dare to make any other move. After confirming that the kid wouldn’t try getting off the bed, Lin Qiao slowly took her hand away. She wanted to pat the kid’s head, but was worried that the kid might be frightened.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then recalled that grey rabbit. So, she stood up instantly and turned to run toward the grass woods by the strawberry field.</p> <p>The group of people quickly showered themselves and put their pants back on. However, their upper bodies were still bared, as they had all used their tops as towels, and those shirts were still wet.</p> <p>After the shower, the group of dirty men now looked clean and refreshed.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao suddenly run toward the strawberry field, seemingly looking for something, Lu Tianyi and the others walked toward Wu Yueling. After walking to the bedside, they finally confirmed that the kid was indeed the little princess from their base.</p> <p>Among all three base leaders, only Wu Yuecheng had a daughter. Therefore, Wu Yueling became the little princes of Sea City Base.</p> <p>“She’s really our little princess, but how is she…” Lu Tianyi carefully looked at Wu Yueling, his eyes filled with puzzles. He then raised his head and glanced at Lin Qiao, finding that the latter was searching for something among grasses.</p> <p>“What is she doing?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming looked at Lin Qiao, then thought for a while and said, “I think she’s looking for the rabbit. Didn’t we see a grey rabbit earlier?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi was still confused. He turned to look at Kong Qingming and asked, “Rabbit? Why is she looking for the rabbit?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming shrugged and said, “How am I supposed to know? I just made a guess.”</p> <p>Xie Dong walked over. He knew that Lin Qiao was looking for the rabbit because the little princess knew it. He also understood that the little one was certainly unable to recognize Lin Qiao at the moment, as her appearance had changed drastically.</p> <p>He looked at Wu Yueling, wondering what had frightened the kid, and what had happened to her outside.</p> <p>Soon, Lin Qiao returned with the grey rabbit, making Lu Tianyi glance at Kong Qingming with surprise.</p> <p>Kong Qingming had guessed right; Lin Qiao was really looking for the rabbit.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the bed with the rabbit, finding the group of people standing by the bed, looking at her with curiosity. Xie Dong and Lin Qiao glanced at each other. The two of them understood each other while all the others were utterly confused.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over. This time, she didn’t sit on the bed, but gently put the little rabbit on the bed, then took two steps backward.</p> <p>The rabbit was able to recognize people! At first, it rolled its body into a fluffy ball on the bed. Then, its nose twitched slightly; after sniffing, it itched its way toward Wu Yueling.</p> <p>“Eh? Why didn’t it run? Why is it approaching the girl?” Huang Shou asked with a low voice on seeing the rabbit moving toward Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and the others glanced at Lin Qiao; none of them had an answer. Earlier on when they saw the rabbit, it ran into the grasses and disappeared within a blink, which meant it was still afraid of people. But now, it was getting closer to the little princes. That was strange.</p> <p>Wasn’t it afraid of the little princess? Was it because the little princess was a kid?</p> <p>Seeing the little rabbit getting near to Wu Yueling, Lin Qiao sighed with relief.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the group of people didn’t try approaching. They all understood that by getting closer, they would frighten the kid even more. The child was already in such an intense terror, so they didn’t dare to stimulate her again, or she might actually faint.</p> <p>The little grey rabbit hopped toward the little one. It couldn’t sense her emotions, but it liked her vibe. So, it gently put its head against the little one’s ankle.</p> <p>The little one gave a start and trembled again when she felt a fluffy thing touch her ankle. The rabbit rubbed its head slightly against her ankle, making her slightly itchy.</p> <p>But still, she didn’t dare to move, and kept her body tightened.</p> <p>Without receiving her response, the little rabbit hopped onto her feet and rested there.</p> <p>The group of people didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>Seeing that, Lin Qiao stopped worrying. She went to the strawberry field and picked a few ripe strawberries, washing them and coming back to the bed.</p> <p>A while later, the little one slowly calmed down. She was distracted by the thing on her feet, so she was less frightened now. She slowly raised half of her head to look at the thing on her feet with one eye. As a result, she saw a grey furry ball covering her feet.</p> <p>‘Eh? This fluffy ball looks familiar!’</p> <p>Suddenly, Wu Yueling forgot how scared she was, and started to observe the fluffy ball on her feet.</p>",
  "Chapter 218: The Little One Wakes Up": "<p>Wu Yueling’s attention was attracted by the grey ball of fur. She slowly raised her other eyes to look at the furry ball and soon found that it was moving, and had a pair of long ears.</p> <p>‘It looks like a rabbit. Where is this rabbit from? It’s familiar…’ she thought. She wanted to touch the rabbit, but she sharply sensed that some people were gazing at her. So, she didn’t dare to move, quickly burying her face back between her knees.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the group of people and tilted her head slightly to signal for them to step back. Only Kong Qingming saw her move while the others were all looking at Wu Yueling, so he stared at her with a questioning look.</p> <p>“Back…” Lin Qiao said one word with a low voice. Kong Qingming looked at her, then turned to Lu Tianyi and the others, and back to her again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at him, after which, Kong Qingming touched Lu Tianyi’s uncovered arm. The other turned to look at him, his eyes carrying questions.</p> <p>Kong Qingming glanced at the little one, then said, “Step back and give her some space.” While speaking, he moved back for two meters.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi glanced at the little one, then turned and left, dragging the others away as well. Meanwhile, Lin Qiao didn’t move, just crossing her arms and silently feeling the changes in the little one’s emotions.</p> <p>The little one sensed that some people around her had left. So, she quietly raised her head to look around and found a weird-looking person wearing a hat and sunglasses.</p> <p>That person was at a distance away, so she wasn’t nervous, even though she did care about that person’s presence.</p> <p>At that moment, the rabbit moved on her feet. It raised its head to stare at her. Seeing it, Wu Yueling was immediately cheered up. She happily unwrapped her knees and slowly picked the rabbit up.</p> <p>‘It’s really that rabbit!’</p> <p>After confirming that the rabbit was really her friend, Wu Yueling suddenly relaxed, then raised her head to look around. The grassland and the lake were both the same as before. Some furniture pieces were new, including beds, couches and tables. Where did all those come from?</p> <p>‘Where is that ugly zombie sister?’ She wondered.</p> <p>After recognizing the space, she instantly turned to search for Lin Qiao. She ignored Lin Qiao who was wearing a hat and sunglasses, but tried to look for the zombie with scarred face and unbrushed hair.</p> <p>‘Eh? Where is the zombie sister?’</p> <p>She held the little rabbit and looked around. But instead of the zombie sister, she found a group of strange men who were baring their upper bodies.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that the kid was looking for her. So, she slightly raised a hand, waved at the child, and said, “Ling…”</p> <p>Wu Yueling turned to look at her confusedly. Lin Qiao was holding a few strawberries with her other hand. She quietly walked to the bed, then squatted before Wu Yueling and raised her head to look at the kid.</p> <p>“Eat…strawberries…” she said and handed the kid those strawberries. Meanwhile, she glanced at the others and found that they were about ten meters away. Confirming that, she pulled her sunglasses slightly down and let Wu Yueling see her dark eyes.</p> <p>The other human beings might be scared by her eyes, but not Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Wu Yueling widened her eyes as she stared at Lin Qiao’s eyes, surprised and confused at the same time. Without knowing how to react, she gazed straight at the other.</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled and pushed the sunglasses upward, then reached the strawberries further toward Wu Yueling while saying, “I’m…here…”</p> <p>Wu Yueling still didn’t know how to react. She frowned slightly as she looked at Lin Qiao while struggling. She wanted to say to Lin Qiao, ‘You’re not her. You don’t have long hair, or ugly scars, or…’</p> <p>With that thought, Wu Yueling abruptly turned her eyes to Lin Qiao’s chest. She remembered that the zombie sister had a flat chest! But, this big-breasted sister had the same kind of dark eyes as the zombie sister.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that the kid didn’t believe her, and understood why. It was indeed a little difficult for Wu Yueling to recognize her now.</p> <p>What could she do? ‘Kids are really the most difficult creatures in the world,’ she thought.</p> <p>Suddenly, she saw something in Wu Yueling’s pocket that looked familiar. She looked closer and recognized it as the grass dragonfly that she made for Wu Yueling. Moreover, it was still green.<br/>\n‘Shouldn’t it have dried out long ago?’</p> <p>Spotting the grass dragonfly, Lin Qiao had an idea. She stood up and walked to the grass, then squatted and picked up a few grass leaves. After doing that, she came back to the bed.</p> <p>This time, she sat down on the end of the bed while facing Wu Yueling, then began making another grass dragonfly.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao’s movements, Wu Yueling popped her eyes in shock. She stared straight at the former, watching her weave the grass leaves into a dragonfly. Then, she lowered her head and took her treasured old grass dragonfly out of her pocket.</p> <p>She looked at her own dragonfly, then at Lin Qiao’s. Soon, she wore a bewildered look.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put the new dragonfly by her side, then closed her eyes to see the outside world.</p> <p>The young female zombie had left the suite.</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened her eyes and glanced at Wu Yueling. She just couldn’t understand why the little one was with that zombie.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the young female zombie was angry at the moment. She rushed into a zombie crowd with a strong intention of killing, smashing the heads of those zombies with her claws.</p> <p>Within a blink, the area around her was covered by the bodies of dead zombies; the heads of all of these zombies had been crushed.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Xiao Yunlong was squatting by Meng Yue’s side, waiting for her to wake up. The latter was lying on a double couch moved her eyelids slightly, then slowly opened her eyes.</p> <p>“Eh…” She tried to move, but then the pain that came from her entire body made her moan. Xiao Yunlong immediately raised his head and looked at her while exclaiming with surprise, “Meng Yue! You’re awake!”</p> <p>Meng Yue knitted her brows and tried to sit up. Seeing this, Xiao Yunlong hurriedly helped her. After sitting up, she looked around and asked, “Ling Ling…Where’s Ling Ling? Why didn’t I see Ling Ling?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong remained silent for a while, then said with a bitter face, “Ling Ling was…taken away by the zombie queen.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Meng Yue immediately widened her eyes. She grabbed Xiao Yunlong’s arm and yelled, “You…How could you let it take Ling Ling away! Why did you let it take Ling Ling away? Eh-hem-hem-hem…”</p> <p>However, before she finished talking, she felt suffocated, then couldn’t help but cough.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong gently rubbed her back and said with concern, “Calm down! Try sensing Ling Ling’s location. Let’s see if we can find her.” He understood that since a long while had passed, there was not much hope for Ling Ling to survive. However, he had to do something, because the guilty feeling had been torturing him.</p> <p>‘Why didn’t the zombie kill us and eat our hearts? At least we wouldn’t need to suffer this torment then!’</p> <p>‘If Ling Ling is gone…’</p>",
  "Chapter 219: Revenge At Least": "<p>Meng Yue stared at Xiao Yunlong and suddenly fell in silence. Seeing that, the latter said to her, “What’s wrong? Just try to feel her!” His voice brought Meng Yue back to her senses, and she instantly closed her eyes to sense carefully.</p> <p>One second, two seconds, three seconds…One minute, two minutes…Five minutes later, Meng Yue opened her eyes and asked, “How long have I slept for?”</p> <p>Seeing the look on her face, Xiao Yunlong had a bad feeling. He had prepared himself mentally before, but Meng Yue’s expression still made him feel despairing.</p> <p>Meng Yue’s reaction meant that she didn’t feel the seed inside Ling Ling’s body.</p> <p>If Ling Ling were dead, the seed would be dead as well.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong lowered his head and took his hands away from Meng Yue, then squatted and buried his face into his palms.</p> <p>“Three hours…”</p> <p>Meng Yue widened her eyes. Then, those eyes turned red, and tears gushed out.</p> <p>“What should we do now? Should we try finding Ling Ling?” Xiao Yunlong raised his head and asked. Meng Yue looked at him and responded, “Find her? Where? I can’t sense anything of hers now…”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong closed his eyes. A few seconds later, he opened those eyes and said with determination, “Let’s go find Chief. At least…we should let him know about this…It’s all our fault. We failed to keep Ling Ling safe. Even if he kills me…”</p> <p>Meng Yue suddenly burst in laughter, “Hah…Kill you? What’ll change even if he killed both of us…hehe…”</p> <p>She was laughing, but her face wore no expression, and was covered in tears.</p> <p>Meng Yue wasn’t just thinking about Wu Chengyue’s feelings. She was awfully sad too, as she had been treating Ling Ling as her own daughter. She was taking care of Ling Ling the whole time because she hoped that Wu Chengyue would accept her one day. But now, it was over. Wu Yueling was taken away from her and Xiao Yunlong by a zombie.</p> <p>How should she face Wu Chengyue now? Poor Ling Ling, she was so little! Meng Yue believed that Ling Ling had died because of her and Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong took a deep breath, then said, “Whatever will happen, we should tell him. Then we’ll find that zombie together. At least…we need to take revenge.”</p> <p>Meng Yue paused for a second, then raised her head to look at him. He was right! Even if Wu Chengyue decided to kill them both, they would accept that as a result. However, no matter what would happen, they needed to take revenge.</p> <p>After making the decision, the two of them immediately left to find Wu Chengyue. Meng Yue was injured, so the tall and sturdy Xiao Yunlong carried her on his back.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Following a series of thunder, the cold raindrops fell from the sky. On the other side, Wu Chengyue was standing on the balcony of a penthouse near West Lake. In the post-apocalyptic era, people could find lots of empty, abandoned buildings.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gazed at the dark, rainy sky, which seemed to be crying sadly for someone. The rainwater fell on the ground, roofs, and leaves, washing off the dust in the post-apocalyptic world.</p> <p>Seeing the rain, Wu Chengyue suddenly had a weird feeling, which wasn’t so good. That feeling made him feel a little suffocated. He wondered if the weather was making him feel depressed.</p> <p>Thinking of the one who stole his zombie nucleus, Wu Chengyue wore a dark face, his whole body radiating a cold vibe. If anyone was standing by his side, that person would know that even the rain was warmer than him.</p> <p>He was really mad. How dare anyone steal from him! So bold!</p> <p>He raised his head to look at the sky again. He forcibly eased the anger in his heart and calmed himself down. Then, he realized that he shouldn’t keep staying in this place. So, he decided to go back to his daughter first, then send some people here to search this area.</p> <p>He was worried about his daughter.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong as a level-six superpowered man was protecting Ling Ling. However, if there were another level-six zombie in the city, Ling Ling would still be in danger, because Xiao Yunlong was no match for a level-six zombie.</p> <p>Looking at the rain which was growing heavier and heavier, Wu Chengyue decided to return once it abated a little. He had memorized the vibe of the one who had stolen his zombie nucleus, and he would definitely send his people to search for that creature. Perhaps, they would see each other in the future.</p> <p>By then, he would find out who exactly that bold creature was.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At the moment, Wu Yueling, who was staying in Lin Qiao’s space, was less frightened than before. She stayed alert, but the fluffy rabbit in her arms made her feel much better.</p> <p>She had finished the strawberries served by Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Wu Yueling recognized Xie Dong, but not Ling Qiao. After all, her dad had told her that many powerful zombies had black eyes.</p> <p>She wasn’t sure if the one who treated her with strawberries were a person or a zombie. She looked exactly like a person from the base, not as ugly and disgusting as any of those scary zombies out there.</p> <p>And…this good-looking zombie knew how to make grass dragonfly as well…And, Wu Yueling hadn’t found her zombie sister yet.</p> <p>‘Where did she go?’ she wondered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ignored all the puzzles in the little one’s head. As long as the kid stopped being nervous and scared, she didn’t care if the latter recognized her or not.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was now considering about how to send the kid back to her father. She had stolen the father’s treasure not long ago, and now, she was going to pay him back with such a big favor. What a coincidence!</p> <p>But this time, she didn’t need to meet him face to face to give him his daughter back, because she had helpers!</p> <p>Glancing at Lu Tianyi and the others, Lin Qiao decided to send Wu Yueling to her father along with these people. As their leader, Wu Chengyue should bring them back to the base. In that case, Lin Qiao didn’t need to send these people all the way back to the base.</p> <p>She also wondered if Wu Chengyue knew that his daughter was in danger, as he was hunting monsters just now. She wondered how he would react if he found out that his daughter was taken away by a level-six zombie.</p> <p>With these thoughts, she slowly stood up and walked to Xie Dong. Then, she took over the clipboard and waved at Lu Tianyi and the others.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi, Kong Qingming and the others walked to her with confusion.</p> <p>“What? What’s the plan?” Lu Tianyi walked over, then turned back to glance at the little one.</p> <p>He was surprised as the child was no longer frightened. That was such a quick emotional change! Didn’t people say that autistic children were sensitive to their environment? In a strange place, autistic children would feel insecure and highly nervous.</p> <p>But now, the little princess looked rather calm. She reacted the way she was supposed to once she was awake, but now she had calmed down. Why? Was it because of the rabbit? Did the rabbit divert her attention?</p> <p>Or, did this space have some kind of power to comfort children?</p> <p>Lu Tianyi wasn’t the only one who had these questions, as the others too had been making all sorts of guesses.</p>",
  "Chapter 220: A Wave Of Coldness": "<p>‘This kid’s Dad is out there. Do me a favor, send her to her Dad’—Lin Qiao wrote. Lu Tianyi and the others glanced at each other, their eyes showing a surprised look, “Chief Wu is outside? Is his army here too?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head, looking at them as she said, “I…didn’t…see…”</p> <p>She couldn’t tell them that Wu Chengyue was hunting the thunder-powered zombie king alone. She had already stolen the zombie nucleus, so if she told them that, they would figure out what had exactly happened.</p> <p>If these people accidentally let Wu Chengyue know that it was her who had stolen his zombie nucleus…she would surely suffer!</p> <p>Kong Qingming abruptly turned to Lin Qiao in a weird way and said, “Since her father is out there, you can directly send her out, can’t you?” He looked at Lin Qiao and felt that as long as she kept her sunglasses on, no one would find out what she really was.</p> <p>“What I’m more curious about is how did the kid meet you?” Lu Tianyi asked curiously.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wrote—’She was captured by the other level-six zombie.’</p> <p>She didn’t write down the whole story, but the group of people had figured it out.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt like laughing at this point. Earlier on, she had made up another level-six zombie, but just now, one really showed up.</p> <p>“Eh? You mean the one you met earlier?”</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at Lin Qiao with surprise. He didn’t think that there was really another zombie.</p> <p>“Damn! Can zombie kings and queens be seen everywhere now?” Huang Shou popped his eyes and said. Kong Qingming rested his chin on a palm, looking at Lin Qiao as he said, “So you stole the kid from that level-six zombie? You do like stealing from level-six zombies.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi nodded and said, “We can send the kid to Chief. But, I think we should wait until our clothes dry.” While speaking, he turned to the others, who had their upper bodies bared. The others didn’t notice it before, but being reminded by Lu Tianyi, they instantly felt cold.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quickly glanced at them, then carefully observed their bodies.</p> <p>‘Well, not bad. Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming are both tall and fit, with wide shoulders, slim waists, and round butts…’</p> <p>‘Em, their bodies should feel nice. Young people do have nice bodies!’</p> <p>Being gazed by Lin Qiao suddenly, the group of people felt even colder. After taking a few quick glances, Lin Qiao stopped looking at them and wrote—’It’s raining out there, so it should be cold. I’ll try finding some clean clothes for you.’</p> <p>As she turned around and prepared to leave, someone pulled her trousers.<br/>\nShe paused and lowered her head to find that the little one, who was holding the grey rabbit, was standing by her side.</p> <p>“Eh?” When did the little one get off bed? Why did she pull her trousers? Did she recognize her?</p> <p>Wu Yueling was holding the rabbit with one hand, Lin Qiao’s trousers with the other, and looking at the latter confusedly. She still didn’t recognize Lin Qiao. However, she sensitively caught the familiar feeling that the latter gave her.</p> <p>There were strangers in the space, so Wu Yueling quickly ran to Lin Qiao’s side, as she felt safer around the latter.</p> <p>The others all looked at Wu Yueling with curiosity. Lu Tianyi came over, squatting before her. With a smile, he said to Wu Yueling, “Ling Ling, do you remember me? We’ve met each other before.”</p> <p>Once Lu Tianyu approached, Wu Yueling stepped back, hiding behind Lin Qiao. Hearing Lu Tianyi call her nickname, she tilted her head to look at him with one eye.</p> <p>Later on, Kong Qingming came over as well, and Huang Shou followed behind him. As more and more people got close to her, Wu Yueling hid behind Lin Qiao again, without even showing half of her eye.</p> <p>Her dad had told her to stay away from shirtless people!</p> <p>Seeing her reaction, Lu Tianyi turned to Kong Qingming and Huang Shou, complaining, “There too many of us. She’ll be frightened. And, can you topless people stop walking around in front of the little girl?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming turned to look at him and asked, “Are you wearing any top?”</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao waved at them to signal them to leave while saying, “Go…”</p> <p>Then, she took Wu Yueling’s hand and brought her to the furniture area, putting her on a couch. After that, she squatted and said to her, “Your…Dad…is…outside…I’ll…let…them…”</p> <p>She paused briefly as she pointed at Lu Tianyi and the others, then continued, “…take…you…to…him…”</p> <p>Hearing that her Dad was outside, Wu Yueling’s eyes glowed immediately. She happily looked at Lin Qiao, hoping that she could bring her to her father sooner.</p> <p>“It’s…raining…outside…You’ll…see…your…father…when…the…rain…has…stopped…” Lin Qiao continued. She talked very slowly, but Wu Yueling patiently waited for her to finish.</p> <p>Hearing the word ‘rain’, Wu Yueling was suddenly depressed. She took her hand away from Lin Qiao’s trousers, then began petting the rabbit. Sensing that the child was feeling low, Lin Qiao got a little curious. However, she didn’t ask any question, and said, “Don’t…be…afraid.”</p> <p>While speaking, she reached a hand toward Wu Yueling’s head. As the kid didn’t show any repulsion, she put the hand on her head. No one noticed that a vine was quietly reaching out of the water, toward the little one.</p> <p>Lin Qiao considered if she should go out to find clothes for this group of men. They might catch a cold if she made them wear wet clothes, but letting this group of shirtless men walk about in front of the kid was inappropriate.</p> <p>However, if she left, the little one might get nervous again. The kid needed someone to rely on.</p> <p>She turned to look at the others and suddenly saw the stove by the lakeside, as well as the pile of dry wood next to it.</p> <p>Earlier on, Lin Qiao brought that dry wood in from the outside, so that Junjun could cook for Tongtong. As coal and natural gas didn’t exist, so firewood was the only choice.</p> <p>There was plenty of firewood near the stove.</p> <p>‘Yeah, they can start a fire to warm themselves and dry their clothes!’ She thought. With that idea, she suddenly whistled toward Xie Dong, which caught the attention of all.</p> <p>Ignoring the others, Lin Qiao waved at Xie Dong and signaled him to come over. In response, he promptly walked toward her and looked at her without knowing what she wanted.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took over the clipboard and wrote—’See, there’s some firewood. Build a fire to dry their clothes. I won’t go out to look for clothes.’</p> <p>Xie Dong turned back and found the pile of firewood which had been ignored by them the whole time. In fact, if they started a fire, those clothes would soon be dried.</p> <p>He nodded and turned to walk to that direction while waving at Huang Shou.\n</p>",
  "Chapter 221: Two Little Friends": "<p>As the group of people prepared to dry their clothes with fire, Lin Qiao turned back to the little one. Abruptly, something quietly coiled around her hand, so she lowered her head to find that it was a vine. The other end of the vine was still in the lake.</p> <p>‘Mama! I remember her!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the vine, feeling a little surprised. Wu Yueling had also seen the vine coiled around Lin Qiao’s hand. She didn’t know what it was, but she noticed that the latter looked calm.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to Wu Yueling and surprisingly found that the little one wasn’t frightened, only curiously looking at the vine as if she was wondering where it was from and how it had coiled around Lin Qiao’s hand.</p> <p>At that moment, Viney suddenly uncoiled itself from Lin Qiao’s hand and dropped to the ground, then quickly reaching to Wu Yueling. Seeing the vine suddenly move toward her, Wu Yueling was startled. She hurriedly flinched and stepped backward.</p> <p>The sensitive Viney felt that the little one was frightened, so, it paused and turned to Lin Qiao without knowing what to do. Lin Qiao looked at Viney and the little one with surprise, wondering if Viney was trying to be friends with the little one.</p> <p>As Viney stopped moving, the little one relaxed a little bit. She looked at Lin Qiao, then curiously observed Viney. In fact, she wasn’t frightened by Viney because she often saw Meng Yue’s little grasses moving around, and played with them. She wouldn’t repel moving plants, but as she didn’t know Viney before, she was still a little scared of it.</p> <p>Sensing the almost similar feelings that Viney and the little one were having, Lin Qiao smiled.</p> <p>“Its…name…is…Viney…Don’t…be…scared…” she said to the little one. Then, she grasped the vine and put it before the little one’s face.</p> <p>The vine coiled around Lin Qiao’s palm, then raised its head. She then turned her palm up and let Viney stand on it.</p> <p>After watching Lin Qiao’s move, the little one looked at the two leaves on the tip of the vine, then turned to Lin Qiao with hesitation. After that, she looked at the vine again.</p> <p>“Here…It’s…adorable…” Lin Qiao said to her patiently, “It…can…talk…”</p> <p>‘Eh? Talk? Really?’ Wu Yueling widened her eyes, showing a surprised look. Seeing that, Lin Qiao smilingly nodded.</p> <p>On the other side, Lu Tianyi and the others were all curiously watching Lin Qiao and the little girl. They knew that the little princess was afraid of strangers, so they didn’t approach her. From their angle of view, they weren’t able to see Viney, so they thought that Lin Qiao was saying something to the little princess, but had no idea that she was actually trying to introduce Viney to Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Three among the group had fire power. Their powers had only restored by thirty percent, so they weren’t able to launch attacks at the moment. However, starting a fire was still something they could do.</p> <p>They put some firewood together and started a large bonfire. Then, they surrounded the fire and raised their clothes to dry.</p> <p>“So weird! Little Princess isn’t afraid of that lady. Why?” Huang Shou turned his cloth over, then glanced at Lin Qiao and said curiously. The others all turned to look at Lin Qiao and the little girl. Indeed, the two of them seemed to be getting along pretty well.</p> <p>“Maybe because that lady is a good person?” Said Liu Jing.</p> <p>“Are we all bad guys?” The others rolled their eyes and one of them retorted.</p> <p>“Eh-hem…hehe, we’re not bad guys, but we’re weird guys…Because we’re topless!”</p> <p>None of the others responded this time.</p> <p>On the other side, the little one’s big eyes were filled with curiosity and disbelief.</p> <p>“I…didn’t…lie, You…try…” Lin Qiao looked at her and said. While speaking, she gently pulled up the little one’s hand which was on the rabbit’s back, then raised her forefinger to touch Viney’s head.</p> <p>‘Ahyaya! Little one! Little one!’</p> <p>The little one immediately pulled her finger back, then popped her eyes and stared at Lin Qiao in shock.</p> <p>“Am…I…right?” Lin Qiao smiled and nodded. The little one nodded with doubt. She wasn’t sure if what she heard just now was real. At that moment, Viney was wriggling in Lin Qiao’s palm, as if it was happy.</p> <p>‘Mama! Mama! Her look is interesting! I want to play with her!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Viney, then tried to talk to the little one, “Again?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling’s curiosity was aroused. She looked at Lin Qiao, and the latter nodded at her. This time, Lin Qiao didn’t need to do anything, as the little girl slowly reached a hand toward Viney, then touched it with hesitation.</p> <p>‘Little one, don’t be afraid…I won’t bite you…’</p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at Lin Qiao, as she wasn’t sure if Viney was talking to her.</p> <p>‘Yes, yes…Little Ling Ling is little one…the little one is Ling Ling…’</p> <p>‘Eh? Do you know what am I thinking?’</p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at Viney with surprise, then said a few words in her head. After that, she saw Viney wagging the two tiny leaves on its head proudly.</p> <p>‘I do, I do…How should I talk to you if I don’t?’</p> <p>‘Why can you read my mind? What are you?’ Wu Yueling thought.</p> <p>‘I am what I am! I am Viney…Call me Viney…Call me Viney…’</p> <p>Sensing their conversation, Lin Qiao found that the two little things had started to get along, and felt delighted as well.</p> <p>She pulled Viney away from her hand, then put it by Wu Yueling’s side. After that, she pinched Viney’s head and said to it silently, ‘I need to go out to locate the little one’s father. You play with her.’</p> <p>Viney flapped its leaves and responded with, ‘Yes, Mama! I’ll take care of her!’</p> <p>Maybe because Viney was a plant, Lin Qiao sensed a unique tone of talking while receiving its message, as if it was talking like a sweet little girl.</p> <p>“You…play…here…I’ll…go…see…where…your…Dad…is…” Lin Qiao said to Wu Yueling. At that moment, Viney suddenly added, ‘Mama, Mama, I can fix your body now! I have plenty of energy!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded. She glanced at the group of people who were surrounding the bonfire, then nodded again and responded silently, ‘Good, I’ll go down the lake after those people have left.’</p> <p>‘I’ll be expecting you!’ Viney replied.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up to observe Wu Yueling’s reaction. She found that the kid was only looking at her, but didn’t reach out her hand to try and grab her. Perhaps, she wanted to see her father as soon as possible.</p>",
  "Chapter 222: Acid Rain": "<p>Lin Qiao turned to glance at the others, then took a step backward and disappeared.</p> <p>“Eh? That lady went out. Where did she go? Is she going to find Chief Wu?” Huang Shou raised his head to find that Lin Qiao had disappeared, so he asked. The others glanced at that area too, then turned back while one of them responded carelessly, “Perhaps…Huang Shou, add some firewood. The fire is too small.”</p> <p>“Sure!”</p> <p>Zheng Xiaonian sighed abruptly and said, “If we have some sweet potatoes or cassavas, we could roast them in the live charcoals. It’d be delicious!”</p> <p>The others rolled their eyes and said, “Even if we did have some, you wouldn’t dare to eat them!” The virus was everywhere, so no one dared to eat anything that hadn’t been purified in a base.</p> <p>“But, didn’t we all eat those mutant strawberries?” Said Huang Shou, “It’s strange though! We’re really fine…It has been two days.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi nodded and said, “Don’t worry! Those strawberries should be safe, since two days have passed and nothing has happened to us. Besides, she has no reason to give us poisonous food. And you see, she gave some strawberries to Little Princess too, didn’t she?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming looked at him and replied, “Have you forgotten what kind of a person she used to be?”</p> <p>Once he said that, the others immediately fell into silence. Lu Tianyu and Xie Dong both had their faces darkened a little, while Huang Shou and the others wore a confused look.</p> <p>“Eh? Boss, what do you mean…Do you know her?”</p> <p>Seeing Lu Tianyi’s sullen face, Kong Qingming understood that the former didn’t want to hear that. However, he believed that he still needed to remind Lu Tianyi about that. Lu Tianyu had changed a lot, but based on what she had done before, Lu Tianyi should keep vigilance against her.</p> <p>“What happened?” Sensing the atmosphere which had changed because of Kong Qingming’s words, the others were more confused.</p> <p>What was wrong? Was there something going on between their boss and that lady? But, they didn’t know that lady before, so how could she suddenly be in some kind of relationship with their boss?</p> <p>However, if that lady knew their boss, it would explain why she saved them!</p> <p>These people thought that Lin Qiao was just a nice person who happened to be passing by and saved them conveniently. But now, they started to make other guesses.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi blinked and said, “We’ve already eaten those strawberries anyway, so what is the worst thing that can happen? I choose to believe her. You should have noticed that she is completely different from what she used to be. If she didn’t admit, would you recognize her as that woman?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming silently looked at him for a while, then turned to gaze at his shirt. Lu Tianyi was right! Right now, they had no choice but to believe her. What else could they do? She provided them with food and water, not to mention the fact that she had saved them.</p> <p>At that point, Huang Shou suddenly pointed at a pile of potatoes and said, “Look, aren’t those potatoes? Let’s roast some potatoes!” While speaking, he stood up, ran to the pile of potatoes. Soon, he returned back, carrying some of them.</p> <p>“Sadly, we don’t have ketchup!” said Zheng Xiaonian.</p> <p>The others spent three seconds staring at him silently, and then, they said to Huang Shou in one voice, “Huang Shou, put the potatoes down in the fire.”</p> <p>“Sure!” Huang Shou grinned and responded.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At the moment, Ling Qiao had no idea that Kong Qingming and Lu Tianyi were both in low spirits for a while because of her. She was standing by a window in a corridor, looking at the rain.</p> <p>Sensing the sour air coming from the outside, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but sneeze. Then, she rubbed her nose and looked at the sky. The weather in the post-apocalyptic world was awful. When the sun came out, it would be so hot, about forty or fifty degrees, even sixty at times; people would feel like burning under the sunlight. However, during night-time, it would be terribly cold.</p> <p>The rainwater was acidic, which was why Lin Qiao sensed a sourness.</p> <p>Lin Qiao crossed her arms before her chest. At the moment, she wasn’t able to sense the scent of others, as the rainwater had washed all scents away and brought a sour smell which badly affected her nose.</p> <p>She wasn’t sure if Wu Chengyue was still in the same old spot or not. If he had left, she might not be able to find him. However, his army should be nearby. If she failed to locate him, she would go find his soldiers.</p> <p>As for Wu Chengyue’s soldiers, both Meng Yue and Xiao Yunlong thought that they had all been killed by the zombie queen. What they didn’t know was that not long after they left to chase the zombie queen, all the soldiers who had fallen to the ground woke up.</p> <p>The squad leaders woke up before the others. After all, they were all level-five superpowered men, and their bodies recovered quicker than the others.</p> <p>As they opened their eyes to find themselves lying on the ground defenselessly, they hurriedly sat up. Then, they saw that the others were all lying on the ground, and they didn’t know if they were still alive.</p> <p>They panicked as they struggled up from the ground to check the others. But then, they found that those people were merely fainted, with absolutely no wounds on their bodies.</p> <p>They shook those people and easily woke them up. After the last man was woken up, the group of soldiers checked each other up and found that they were just knocked out.</p> <p>No one knew what had happened.</p> <p>When they rushed up to their Deputy Chief’s room, they found the room empty, with traces left by a battle.</p> <p>What on earth had happened? They didn’t know. They only knew that someone had hit them on the back of their heads and knocked them out. They felt that because after waking up, they could still feel a dull pain from the back of their heads. However, they had no idea who had attacked them.</p> <p>There were about a thousand of them. However, the attacker knocked them all out without making any noise. That was scary!</p> <p>But soon, they started feeling lucky, because no zombies came here while they were unconscious. Otherwise, they would have all been eaten, wouldn’t they?</p> <p>But, why did no zombies come here? That was really weird! Before they fainted, they had seen quite some zombies nearby.</p> <p>Before, they would shoot any zombies that tried to approach, but as they had all fainted, no one was there shooting zombies. For that reason, there should be more and more zombies.</p> <p>About ten squad leaders gathered in Xiao Yunlong’s room, discussing.</p> <p>“What should we do now? We don’t know where did Chief Leader and Great Captain go. It seems that they were forced to leave in a haste.”</p> <p>“We can’t evacuate without an order. We don’t know where Deputy Chief is, so I think we should send some people to report to Chief.”</p> <p>“But, Chief is inside the zombie city. We might encounter zombie leaders there.”</p> <p>“We have to go. We’ll bring more people with us. Not only Deputy Chief and Great Captain have disappeared, but Ling Ling has disappeared as well! She’ll be fine if she’s with Deputy Chief, but what if she’s in danger? Anyhow, we need to inform Chief about what happened.”</p> <p>“There’s no better way.”</p> <p>As a result, five level-five squad leaders led tens of soldiers toward the city.</p>",
  "Chapter 223: Send You Out": "<p>The rain lasted for two hours while Lin Qiao stayed in her space and watched the group of people roasting potatoes and talking to the little one.</p> <p>The little seemed to have believed that Lin Qiao was her zombie sister. However, she still didn’t understand why the zombie sister looked different now.</p> <p>As the little one curiously stared at Lin Qiao’s face, the latter patiently explained to her, “My face is fixed.”</p> <p>Hearing that, the little one nodded dubiously.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi, who had already put on the dried shirt, found a bowl and put two perfectly roasted potatoes in the bowl before walking to Lin Qiao and standing by her side. While peeling a potato, he looked at Lin Qiao and asked, “How do you know that these mutant potatoes and pumpkins are edible? Aren’t you afraid that we might all become zombies?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her head to glance at him, but remained silent. Seeing Lu Tianyi getting closer, the little one automatically moved toward Lin Qiao and hid behind her, only exposing a little foot.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi glanced at her, then asked another question, “What will you do after we leave? You’re here to find the Planning Bureau. Is there anything you need?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him and nodded.</p> <p>She wanted to find all sorts of files about the resources in this city, so she would know where all the supplies were stored. She understood that those storages might have been emptied by the people who used to work in the Planning Bureau. However, under the urgent situation during the apocalyptic era, there must be some storages left untouched.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi blinked, showing an indescribable emotion. “Will you…go back to the base? Or, where will you settle down?” He asked. He understood that her current condition wouldn’t allow her to go back to the base. He asked the first question without thinking, and what he really wanted was the answer to the second question.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed his thoughts as she looked at him from head to toe with surprise. During the past few days, she had honestly felt that Lu Tianyi cared about her. She understood that the one he really cared about was Lu Tianyu, and she didn’t quite understand why. The relationship between Lu Tianyi and Lu Tianyu should be awful, so why would he care about her?</p> <p>Judging by Lu Tianyu’s attitude toward him, Lin Qiao didn’t think that the latter would actually care about her, and she just couldn’t figure out why. Since she met him, he hadn’t shown any repulsion toward her.</p> <p>She crossed her arms before her chest as she kept staring at Lu Tianyi and thinking. While reviewing Lu Tianyu’s memories and recalling the moments every time Lu Tianyu saw Lu Tianyi, she finally started to understand.</p> <p>At first, their relationship was awful indeed. When seeing each other for the first time in the base, they only glanced at each other, then pretended not to know each other and walked away.</p> <p>When Lu Tianyi was bullied by other people in the base, Lu Tianyu only looked on without offering any help.</p> <p>Later on, they would both try avoiding each other every time they met. However, the sensitive Lin Qiao discovered the changes in the look in Lu Tianyi’s eyes which happened at that time.</p> <p>His eyes were still filled with hatred and anger, but were also added with some anticipation.</p> <p>What was he looking forward to?</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him in the eyes.</p> <p>Earlier on, Lin Qiao looked at Lu Tianyi from head to toe and made him feel a little uncomfortable. Now, she stared at him right in the eyes, making him even more confused.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised a hand to pull the sunglasses slightly down and exposed her dark eyes. After gazing at Lu Tianyi for three seconds, she put the sunglasses back up.</p> <p>“What? What’s wrong?” Lu Tianyi couldn’t help but ask.</p> <p>“You…care…about?” Lin Qiao said. ‘You care about me? I think we weren’t so close before, were we?’</p> <p>Lu Tianyi looked at her and responded with, “You have changed, didn’t you?”</p> <p>‘Em…If I tell you that I’m not your evil sister, will you want to kill me?’ Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>At that moment, the little one stuck her head out from behind Lin Qiao, looked at Lu Tianyi, who gently smiled at her. Seeing that, the little girl flinched immediately.</p> <p>Lin Qiao closed her eyes to observe the outside the world. Finding that the rain had stopped, she turned to say to the little one, “I…go…out…find…your…Dad…You…wait…here…”</p> <p>After saying that, she looked at the kid, waiting for her response. The little girl looked at her for a few seconds with a pair of sparkling eyes, then nodded. After that, she carried the rabbit and sat on the couch.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then turned to Lu Tianyi and said, “Send…you…out…” While speaking, she tilted her head toward the group of people, signaling for Lu Tianyi to tell them to get ready to leave.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi turned back and walked toward the group of people, then said to them, “Get ready, we’re leaving this place.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao followed him over. As he finished talking, she pressed a hand on his shoulder, then both of them disappeared while the group of people hurriedly stood up.</p> <p>The next second, Lin Qiao showed up again, then brought two people out.</p> <p>After flashing in and out of her space for six or seven times, Lin Qiao finally got the whole group of people out.</p> <p>She sighed while complaining silently about how troublesome this was. If only she could send people in and out without touching them…</p> <p>The group of people showed up on the roof of a three-story building. The roof was wet; the rain had just stopped, so there was a lot of moisture in the air.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood on the edge of the roof and carefully sniffed the air. Before she could locate Wu Chengyue, a series of thunder was heard from the sky. Before the group of people could react, a bolt of thunder descended toward the roof.</p> <p>Sizzling! Boom!</p> <p>“Damn!” Lin Qiao reacted fast and leaped toward the roof of another building while the others all rolled to the side on the ground.</p> <p>“I was going to leave, but you showed up so soon. Thankfully, I didn’t go far, or you’d escape!” A bland voice was heard.</p> <p>The people who had fallen to the floor because of the lightning bolt all turned to the source of the voice, then saw a smiling handsome man who was looking at the other roof.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was on that roof.</p> <p>“Chief!”</p> <p>“Chief!”</p> <p>Seeing their Chief, the group of people were quite surprised, though they didn’t understand why their Chief tried to attack them with a lightning bolt.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming were doing better than the others. They didn’t react as fast as Lin Qiao did, but were still nimble enough to dodge the lightning. Anyhow, they were level-five superpowers men.</p> <p>However, they both looked as confused as their teammates. They completely had no idea about what had just happened. Why on earth did Chief attack them?</p> <p>On seeing that Wu Chengyue was smilingly staring at Lin Qiao, they turned to that direction too. Then, they found that Lin Qiao had turned around, seeming to be preparing to run.</p> <p>‘Something happened earlier between them!’ the group of people concluded immediately.</p>",
  "Chapter 224: Being Attacked Once She Shows Up": "<p>Hearing Wu Chengyue’s voice, Lin Qiao glanced back at him, then disappeared. Next second, Wu Chengyue showed up in where she was standing, with an even bigger smile. Meanwhile, the group of people sensed the fierce coldness radiating in the area three meters around their Chief.</p> <p>At the moment, Lin Qiao was cursing inside her head.</p> <p>‘Damn! Why did that man show up so quickly? How on earth did he find out my location!’</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao enter the space, the little one thought that she was going to bring her out. So, the kid quickly ran to her and held her hand. Lin Qiao looked at the little one and couldn’t help but feel helpless.</p> <p>Before, she felt a little guilty for stealing Wu Chengyue’s zombie nucleus. But to her surprise, she got a chance to pay him back so soon, because she had saved his daughter from a zombie queen, and was going to return the child to him perfectly unharmed. For this reason, she thought that he should forgive her for stealing the zombie nucleus.</p> <p>Just now, she suffered a lightning attack from him, but she intended to take revenge for that the next time!</p> <p>Looking at the scarily smiling Wu Chengyue, the group of people were a little frightened. They didn’t know why their Chief attacked them…But now, they had somehow figured that their Chief was actually targeting that nice lady!</p> <p>Lu Tianyi wanted to figure out what exactly was happening now, so he hurriedly stood up and said to Wu Chengyue, “Chief Wu…can we quit fighting and talk instead? What…is happening here?”</p> <p>Hearing him, Wu Chengyue, who was standing on the other roof, turned back and glanced at the group of people. After that, he slowly walked over, stepped on the guardrail on the edge of the roof, and leaped onto this building, quietly landing before the group.</p> <p>He rested both hands in his pocket and smiled at Lu Tianyi as he asked, “Is he with you? Do you know who he is?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi looked at him with surprise and responded, “Eh? Don’t you know who she is?”</p> <p>He thought that Wu Chengyue knew that the lady was Lu Tianyu, and that he attacked her for what she did to him before. But to his surprise, Wu Chengyue asked him who she was. It turned out that the latter didn’t recognize her.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue maintained that smile and continued, “If I knew, I wouldn’t be wasting time talking to you.”</p> <p>Facing Wu Chengyue’s smiling face, Lu Tianyi’s fine hairs all stood straight up. “Then…how did she offend you?” He asked. He decided to figure the whole thing out before mentioning the little princess.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s slender eyes curved a little in that scary smile. He looked at Lu Tianyi while saying, “Aren’t you with him? Didn’t you notice that he has obtained a zombie nucleus a couple of days ago?”</p> <p>At that point, the others had all moved closer, looking at Wu Chengyue curiously. Hearing Wu Chengyue mention a zombie nucleus, they immediately thought of the nucleus which was thrown into the lake by that lady.</p> <p>Kong Qingming crossed his arms before his chest as he looked at Wu Chengyue and asked confusedly, “Eh? How do you know about it?”</p> <p>Then, the group of people heard Wu Chengyue’s meaningful laughter, “Hehe, of course I know about it, because I killed that thunder-powered zombie king! When I killed it, someone showed up suddenly and stole the zombie’s head!”</p> <p>“…Eh?” Lu Tianyi and the others couldn’t believe what they had heard. Kong Qingming turned to Lu Tianyi and asked, “Didn’t she say that there was another level-six zombie? Why Chief Wu?”</p> <p>“How am I supposed to know?” Lu Tianyi looked back at him and responded.</p> <p>Huang Shou turned to Zheng Xiaonian and said, “Ah, so the zombie nucleus belonged to Chief Wu! But, why did she tell us that there was another zombie?”</p> <p>Zheng Xiaonian shrugged and replied, “How am I supposed to know?”</p> <p>The smile on Wu Chengyue’s face now turned even weirder as he said, “Ah, so she described me as another zombie king? Alright, it’s fine, I don’t mind. But, which one of you can tell me about her identity and background? Eh?”</p> <p>Even though he was speaking with a faint smile, he had taken one hand out of his pocket, palm facing the sky with a sphere of sizzling lightning on it.</p> <p>He slowly walked to Lu Tianyi and the others while continuing, “Perhaps, you know how to make her show up. I won’t do anything to you if you help me. However, if she keeps hiding while you say nothing, I’ll be having no choice but to think of you as her friends and take care of you!”</p> <p>“No, no, no, no…Chief! Calm down! We can talk! I think there’s some misunderstanding…” The group of people was scared by the lightning in his hand as Kong Qingming hurriedly waved both hands and talked.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled again, and this time, that smile of his had completely turned cold. “Hehe, misunderstanding?” He said, “You spent two days hunting a high-level zombie, but before you harvested the zombie nucleus, some thief stole it. You tell me, what kind of misunderstanding is this?”</p> <p>“Ah…that…that…” Kong Qingming looked at him embarrassedly. He turned to look at Lu Tianyi, thinking that the lady really liked doing suicidal things!</p> <p>Lu Tianyi was wearing an embarrassed look as well. ‘Damn! Is this the zombie king you talked about? He’s even more horrible than a zombie king! Damn! If you’ve stolen from him, don’t let him find you! Now you have thrown us out and hidden back in the space, leaving us to face our Chief’s fury! That’s unfair!’ He cursed inside.</p> <p>Sizzle…The lightning sphere in Wu Chengyue’s hand grew larger, seeing which, Lu Tianyi and the others simultaneously took a step backward.<br/>\nThey didn’t want to tell him about Lin Qiao because she had saved them and provided them with food and water. They couldn’t be ungrateful, could they?</p> <p>However…an infuriated base leader could be terrifying! Especially Chief Wu, who was always smiling and nice-looking.</p> <p>Right at that moment, Liu Jing abruptly started talking, “No…Chief, I mean, how can you still worry about the zombie nucleus? I want to know if you had left Ling Ling nearby?”</p> <p>Ling Ling?</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Chengyue frowned slightly and asked, “How do you know?”</p> <p>Ling Ling was in Binjiang District with Xiao Yunlong and Meng Yue, and that area was indeed nearby. Wu Chengyue looked at Liu Jing while wondering if this group of people had met Xiao Yunlong and Meng Yue.</p> <p>‘Why is he mentioning Ling Ling now? What does he mean?’ He wondered.</p> <p>Before Liu Jing and the others answered his question, a door on the roof of a nearby building was opened. Then, Xiao Yunlong came out of the door, with the fainted Meng Yue carried on his back.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue, Lu Tianyi and all the others instantly turned to them seeing that Meng Yue’s body was covered in blood. She lied on Xiao Yunlong’s shoulder, her head dropped. Xiao Yunlong’s head was slightly lowered as well, as he wasn’t looking at the group of people.</p> <p>The group of people was stunned.</p> <p>‘Damn, what now?’</p>",
  "Chapter 225: Are You Lying": "<p>Seeing the two, Wu Chengyue stopped talking to Lu Tianyi and the others, but hopped onto that roof and darted to Xiao Yunlong and Meng Yue.</p> <p>“Yunlong! Meng Yue! What happened to you!” Wu Chengyue came up to them and asked with a serious look; the smile on his face was gone.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong slightly raised his head, but didn’t look at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue continued asking in an anxious tone, “Why are you here! Where’s Ling Ling? How could you leave? What if high-level zombies attacked the army?”</p> <p>On the other side, Lu Tianyi and the others glanced at each other without knowing what was happening. After that, they all leaped onto this building, but kept a distance away from Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Judging by the look of Deputy Chief Xiao, something had definitely happened. No wonder the little princess was saved by that lady. If she didn’t save the kid, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and the others had nearly figured out the whole story, yet Wu Yueling didn’t know a thing yet. However, at the moment, he panicked a little. Seeing the looks of Xiao Yunlong and Meng Yue, he surely knew that something bad had happened. Most importantly, his daughter wasn’t with them!</p> <p>“Xiao Yunlong, talk! Where’s Ling Ling? And what happened to Meng Yue?” Wu Chengyue stared straight at Xiao Yunlong, then glanced at Meng Yue.</p> <p>“I’m sorry!” Xiao Yunlong quickly glanced at him, then apologized to him with a bitter face and a dry voice.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s pupils shrank as a bad feeling rose in his heart. With disbelief, he shook his head and said, “No…I don’t want your apology! Why did you apologize! Ling Ling…Where’s Ling Ling? Where’s Ling Ling!”</p> <p>Suddenly, he growled out loud. However, Xiao Yunlong responded with the same three words.</p> <p>“I’m sorry…I’m sorry…”</p> <p>Seeing that Wu Chengyue’s energy had started seeping out of his body, Lu Tianyi and the others understood that he was about to lose control of himself.</p> <p>“Wait! Chief! Calm down! Calm down! Ling Ling is…” Lu Tianyi hurriedly shouted out. Xiao Yunlong’s attitude confirmed Wu Chengyue’s guess. If Ling Ling was fine, Xiao Yunlong wouldn’t apologize to him! Besides, the latter didn’t dare to look at him in the eyes.</p> <p>At the moment, his face was already a little twisted. His good-looking slender eyes were now wide open, and a few veins had bulged from his forehead.</p> <p>Hearing Lu Tianyi’s words, he turned back to glared at Lu Tianyi and said with a deep voice, “Calm down? Do you know that I left Ling Ling to him before I came here? But now, he’s not with Ling Ling! Do you understand what kind of danger Ling Ling might face without the protection of his or mine? But now, he’s here with Meng Yue. Where’s my Ling Ling then!”</p> <p>“Here! Your Ling Ling is right here!” Looking at Wu Chengyue’s red eyes, the group of people hurriedly answered his question in one voice.</p> <p>“Yes, Ling Ling is fine! Please calm down!” Said Kong Qingming carefully. If Chief Wu lost control of himself in this place, this group of people would suffer like hell!</p> <p>Normally, Chief Wu was nice and smiling, but when it came to his precious little girl, this nice man would become like a violent terrorist! Not to mention the fact that he was a level-seven superpowered man…Once he lost control of his power, his body might explode!</p> <p>“What did you say?” Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong said in one voice as they turned to Kong Qingming simultaneously. Wu Chengyue paused briefly, and before he said anything, Xiao Yunlong said, “That’s impossible! How can Ling Ling be here? That zombie queen couldn’t possibly bring her here!”</p> <p>His words confirmed Wu Chengyue’s guess.</p> <p>Hearing Xiao Yunlong’s words, Wu Chengyue suddenly turned back as he stared at him and asked, “What? What zombie queen? Why is Ling Ling with a zombie queen?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong glanced at Wu Chengyue, then dropped his head before the latter’s twisted face while murmuring, “I’m sorry…It’s my fault. I failed to protect Ling Ling. I let a weird zombie queen take her away! I’m sorry…sorry…”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s pupils suddenly shrank again. He took a step backward as he replied with disbelief, “That can’t happen…How can there be another level-six zombie…You lied…You lied, didn’t you? Xiao Yunlong, did you lie to me!”</p> <p>At the moment, Xiao Yunlong had already bent his tall and sturdy body. He didn’t say anything, but stood there quietly. Seeing the furious look on Wu Chengyue’s face, Lu Tianyi and the others were getting anxious as well.<br/>\n“Chief! Ling Ling is fine! She was with us just now! Please calm down!” Lu Tianyi shouted.</p> <p>“Sister! Stop hiding! Please come out!” Liu Jing yelled at the sky.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue wasn’t paying attention to Lu Tianyi’s words. Xiao Yunlong was still immersed in the scene of the car crash that Meng Yue and Ling Ling suffered, so he couldn’t listen to anyone at the moment either.</p> <p>However, Liu Jing’s shout attracted Wu Chengyue’s attention, making him turn around and look at Lu Tianyi confusedly.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi took a small step forward and said, “Please calm down and listen to me. Ling Ling is fine. We were with her just now. She was brought here by a zombie queen, that’s true. However, before the zombie did anything to her, she was saved by something else. So, please calm down.”</p> <p>“What?” Wu Chengyue glared at him with disbelief.</p> <p>“He’s right,” Kong Qingming hurriedly added, “It’s that one who disappeared just now. You’ve seen that she has a space. Ling Ling is in her space right now. So, please calm down, so she can bring Ling Ling out.”</p> <p>At that point, Xiao Yunlong made some reaction as well. Also with a confused look, he turned to look at Kong Qingming.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao heard their conversation and felt that it was about time. She hopped onto the roof of another building, then showed her face, standing on the guardrail on the edge of the roof.</p> <p>Once she showed up, the group of people immediately turned to her. At the sight of her, Wu Chengyue automatically attempted to attack.</p> <p>However, Lu Tianyi’s words made him stop.</p> <p>“Wait! Chief, you better stay here. Otherwise, she’ll turn and enter her space right away.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue paused and shouted anxiously at Lin Qiao, “Where’s Ling Ling? Do you have her?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao rolled her eyes, even though her eyes were covered by the sunglasses.</p> <p>‘What does he mean by ‘do I have her’? It’s not like I kidnapped her. Don’t make me sound like a bad person!’ She thought.</p>",
  "Chapter 226: Ling Ling Is Out": "<p>Lin Qiao glanced at Wu Chengyue and felt that he was really worried about his daughter. So, she flashed into her space.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao disappeared without warning, Wu Chengyue’s face darkened immediately, turning back to glare at Lu Tianyi and the others abruptly.<br/>\nSeeing this, the targets of his stare were instantly frightened, all carefully taking a step backward.</p> <p>However, before Wu Chengyue could make any move, Lin Qiao showed up again, with the little one carried in her arms. The kid was still holding the grey rabbit.</p> <p>The group of people sighed in relief on turning to find that Lin Qiao had shown up with Wu Yueling. Finally, they didn’t need to suffer the pressure from their Chief.</p> <p>At the moment, Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong both popped their eyes. The former moved immediately, darting at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao reacted a little quicker than he did. Once he moved, she moved as well. They both flashed across the air and moved to new spots within a second.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stood where Lin Qiao was while the latter moved to the side with the little one.</p> <p>“Stop! Give Ling Ling back to me!” Wu Chengyue growled frowningly. He was enraged, as he didn’t think that Lin Qiao would run. As he finished speaking, he saw Lin Qiao shaking her head at him.</p> <p>“You! What do you want!” Wu Chengyue narrowed his eyes and stared at Lin Qiao with a dark face.</p> <p>He realized that she was a female mostly because of her huge breasts. She was wearing a hat and a sunglasses, so he could only see her nose, lips, and chin.</p> <p>Earlier, this woman stole his level-six zombie nucleus, and now, she kidnapped his daughter! What on earth did she want!</p> <p>Seeing that Lin Qiao didn’t intend to give Ling Ling back, Wu Chengyue was infuriated. His handsome face twisted with rage as he stared at her with a pair of icy-cold eyes. Meanwhile, a purple lightning sphere emerged in his hands.</p> <p>Lin Qiao frowned as well, wondering why this man was so bad-tempered. He was a base leader, yet he couldn’t even stay calm. Every time she saw him, he tried to start a fight. She wasn’t even sure if he was really a leader.</p> <p>Seeing Ling Ling, Xiao Yunlong hurriedly put Meng Yue down by the stairs, let her lean against the wall. After that, he flashed to the other side of Lin Qiao, seeming about to fight her together with Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Seeing that, Lu Tianyi and the others understood that something bad was about to happen.</p> <p>“Wait a moment!” Lu Tianyi hurriedly stepped up and shouted, “Can we please talk? Chief, before we have figured out what’s really going on, I don’t think this is appropriate!”</p> <p>“Yeah,” Kong Qingming added, “This lady has indeed saved Ling Ling. If it weren’t for her, Ling Ling would still be with that level-six zombie. Shouldn’t we thank her?”</p> <p>Hearing him, Xiao Yunlong hesitated. He glanced at Wu Chengyue, then opened his mouth and tried to say something. But at that time, Wu Chengyue responded coldly, “If she didn’t steal my zombie nucleus, I’d thank her sincerely.”</p> <p>“Stealing from you is her fault,” said Kong Qingming, “But she saved your daughter. So somehow, she has made it up to you. Just forgive her, shall we?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue wasn’t trying to hold onto that zombie nucleus. However, he couldn’t forgive Lin Qiao for stealing from him! If she didn’t have Ling Ling, he would have sent a series of lightning bolts down to her.</p> <p>But still, he wouldn’t mix these two events. If she truly saved Ling Ling, he would thank her. However, she stole from him, and for that, she needed to pay.</p> <p>“I’ll accept any of her requirements if she gives Ling Ling to me now. But, she stole from me, and that’s another thing,” he said coldly.</p> <p>“Chengyue, wait,” said Xiao Yunlong, “I think he’s right. You need to calm down now. Earlier on, Ling Ling…was really taken away by a weird level-six zombie. I don’t know why that zombie didn’t hurt Ling Ling, but thankfully, she was saved timely. About that, this lady here has helped us.”</p> <p>‘Thank God! Thank God!’ Xiao Yunlong kept saying to himself. He thought that he would spend the rest of his life with a sense of guilt because he had failed to protect his Goddaughter. But unexpectedly, Ling Ling was saved!</p> <p>Anyhow, this mysterious woman had really helped them.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue only gave him a cold glance, but stayed silent.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao sighed, then squatted and put Wu Yueling down. After that, she pointed at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Wu Yueling understood that Lin Qiao wanted her to go to her Dad, but before leaving, she pulled her cloth. Lin Qiao thought that the kid was reluctant to part with her, but to her surprise, she sensed a thought when holding her little hand.</p> <p>‘Can I come back to play with Viney…’</p> <p>‘So, it’s not because of me? It’s because of Viney! It seems that the two of them are getting along well,’ she thought.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, come to Daddy!” The little girl’s reaction made Wu Chengyue’s heart twitch. For some reason, he suddenly felt that his daughter was about to be taken away from him forever. Hearing his voice, Wu Yueling dropped Lin Qiao’s hand and turned to walk to Wu Chengyue while turning back from time to time.</p> <p>Same as the last time, the rabbit jumped off from her arms and glanced at Wu Yueling, then hopped to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>As the little rabbit left, the little one was immediately a little lost.</p> <p>She stopped after making two steps toward her Dad. Wu Chengyue got a little anxious, and in the next second, he flashed to his daughter’s side and scooped her up.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an arm-thick bolt of lightning descended from the sky, striking at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>‘Damn!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao cursed in her head while nimbly made a backflip to dodge. At that moment, Wu Chengyue had already brought Ling Ling to Xiao Yunlong. All of the others, including Xiao Yunlong, were looking at Wu Chengyue with a stunned look.</p> <p>‘What? Why did you attack without warning? It’s really…eh, unkind for you to attack the person who has helped you with thunderbolts!’</p> <p>However, those people then realized that it was also unkind for Lin Qiao to steal his zombie nucleus.</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue prepared to check Ling Ling up, he unexpectedly saw that his daughter was staring at him angrily with a pair of tearful eyes.</p> <p>‘…Why did you hit Zombie Sister! You hit Zombie Sister again!’</p> <p>Wu Chengyue couldn’t read his daughter’s mind, but still, he understood that his daughter was upset because he attacked that strange woman.</p> <p>‘Why is she on her side now? How has she been brainwashing my daughter these few days!’ He thought.</p>",
  "Chapter 227: ‘Make Friends’ With Her": "<p>Lin Qiao was infuriated!</p> <p>‘Damn! How dare you give me a sneak attack while taking your daughter? Can’t you engage in a decent fight with me? Do you think you can attack anyone you want only because you’re at a high-level?’</p> <p>‘Alright, I’ve stolen your zombie nucleus, but that’s because you attacked me last time! Do you wanna fight? Don’t use your power if you dare! Can you fight me barehand?’</p> <p>Abruptly, she crooked a finger toward Lu Tianyi and signaled for him to come over. Lu Tianyi was looking at her, and seeing her crook her finger, he walked toward her with curiosity. Once he got close to her, he saw that she had taken out the clipboard and written down a line on it.</p> <p>‘Tell him to fight me barehand if he dares!’</p> <p>Finishing writing, she raised the clipboard toward Lu Tianyi and saw the latter wearing a strange look.</p> <p>Barehand?</p> <p>Lu Tianyi glanced at Lin Qiao with surprise, then turned to Wu Chengyue. After that, he turned back to Lin Qiao and asked, “Are you sure?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao directly kicked his lower leg.</p> <p>‘Of course!’</p> <p>“Don’t you know that he used to be a fighter? What, are you trying to get beaten?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her foot again to kick him.</p> <p>‘Wasn’t I a fighter as well? Hm…But Lu Tianyi didn’t know how to fight…’</p> <p>As she raised a foot again, Lu Tianyi moved to the side, then turned to shout at Wu Chengyue, “Chief! She said if you want to fight her, she’ll accept your challenge. But, neither of you can use your powers. You have to fight barehand!”</p> <p>Finishing that, he quickly turned back to Lin Qiao and asked, “Am I right?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao only glanced at him without nodding or shaking her head. After that, she threw the clipboard back into her space, and then rested both hands in her pocket as she slightly raised her chin toward Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was a little unhappy because her daughter had joined a stranger’s side just after a couple of days. His daughter was an autistic kid; she wouldn’t even talk to the people she knew. But now, she was helping someone that she met a couple of days ago. That gave Wu Chengyue a sour feeling.</p> <p>He rubbed his daughter’s head. After confirming that the little girl was perfectly unharmed, he turned and gave Lin Qiao a faint smile, then stood up.</p> <p>“Alright. Don’t hide in your space. I won’t use my power. You’re bold enough to steal my zombie nucleus, but you’re afraid of my lightning…Hehe…”</p> <p>At that point, Wu Yueling suddenly put her arms around Wu Chengyue’s thigh and raised her head to look at him, her brows knitted. It seemed that she didn’t want her father to go.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue lowered his head. He found that his daughter was quite active today, but why did she always help the enemy?</p> <p>He rubbed Wu Yueling’s head, then said, “Good girl, let Daddy go. Daddy won’t kill her. Daddy is trying to make friends with her!”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Yueling relaxed a little, but still looked at her father with confusion.</p> <p>Why did he need to fight her to make friends with her?</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong walked over and squatted behind Wu Yueling, holding her hand as he said, “You kids don’t understand. That’s how adults make friends. Here, come to your godfather. We can watch them, and we also need to look after Sister Yue.”</p> <p>While speaking, he scooped Wu Yueling up, then walked toward the stairs. By the door, he abruptly turned to say to Lin Qiao, “Thank you for saving Ling Ling. I owe you one. If you need any help, find me in my base. I’ll do whatever I can to help.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him, then politely nodded to respond. After that, Xiao Yunlong glanced at Wu Chengyue, then walked into that door.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue understood why Xiao Yunlong gave him that glance. The latter didn’t want him to hurt Lin Qiao. Even though she had stolen his zombie nucleus, she had also saved his daughter, hadn’t she?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was surely aware of that. If this strange lady didn’t save Ling Ling, would he remain calm and talk to her? If she didn’t save Ling Ling’s life, he would have given her a series of violent lightning bolts!</p> <p>Lu Tianyi gave Lin Qiao a glance with concern. He felt that she was trying to get herself hurt, and didn’t understand why she did that.</p> <p>However, he didn’t say anything, but took a step forward and said, “Eh, so the rest of us can be the judges! Are you ready?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over, standing on one side of the roof and leaving the other side to Wu Chengyue. The latter was wearing a smile again as he slowly walked over and stood three meters away from Lin Qiao.</p> <p>The others all popped their eyes and showed an excited look. They didn’t expect things to become like this, and now, they had a show to watch!</p> <p>The group of people just wished that they had some snacks to eat while watching the fight. Since they didn’t have any chairs, they decided to find a place to sit down!</p> <p>Because of the rain, the roof was wet. So, the group of people crowded to the stairs, then sat down side by side.</p> <p>“Will that lady be okay? Chief has mastered all sorts of combat skills!” Liu Jing glanced at Lin Qiao with worry and said. Zheng Xiao Nian shook his head and responded, “I don’t know! We don’t know her well enough!”</p> <p>“Eh, just watch!” Huang Shou said, “We’ll know when they start. I hope our Chief can show some mercy. After all, we should all be polite and gentle to girls!”</p> <p>Girl?</p> <p>The others looked at Lin Qiao, not knowing what to say.</p> <p>“Eh-hem,” Liu Jing said with a low voice. “Look at her! Which part of her looks like a woman? Well, she may look more like a girl if she takes off the shirt wrapped on her shoulder.”</p> <p>Kong Qingming joined the conversation, “What do you think she’ll look like if she took off her hat? Will her hair be shorter than that of men?”</p> <p>“…It seems like that,” said one of the others. “I don’t see any hair on the edge of her hat. Has she shaved that area?”</p> <p>Picturing Lin Qiao with that strange haircut, the group of people all showed a weird look.</p> <p>‘Sister, can’t you make yourself look more like a woman?’</p> <p>Xie Dong stood aside, looking at those people speechlessly. ‘Oi, I don’t think we should talk about her hairstyle right now,’ he thought.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stood in front of Lin Qiao as he looked at her and said, “I don’t know why haven’t you said anything yet, but shouldn’t you at least introduce yourself?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao rolled her eyes.</p> <p>‘Why do you talk so much? Do you wanna fight or not?’ She thought. Instead of saying anything, she took two steps forward and then parted her legs for about a meter, hands raised to her chest level and curled into fists. Then, she slightly turned her body, her eyes fixed on Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao had made the preparatory posture, Wu Chengyue stopped talking and made the same posture.</p> <p>Seeing that, the group of people was stunned.</p> <p>“Whoa! That lady knows how to fight!”</p>",
  "Chapter 228: The Hat Falling Off Means Defeat": "<p>Anyone with some knowledge regarding combat skills would be able to figure out if a person knew how to fight or not based on that person’s posture.</p> <p>Judging by Lin Qiao’s posture, the group of people knew that she was a fighter.</p> <p>“Wow! She has a chance!” They got excited, staring at Lin Qiao and Wu Yueling with anticipation. Lu Tianyi looked at Lin Qiao with surprise as she made the posture, but didn’t forget to take a few more steps backward.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t respond to Wu Chengyue with any words, but he didn’t care. Instead, he smiled and said, “I am really sorry! Normally, I won’t fight a woman. However, since you want to do this, I’ll do it with you. Since this is more like a competition, the one who makes the other’s hat fall off wins.”</p> <p>While speaking, he pulled out the training cap which was tied around his waist and put it on.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly stared at him, without making any response. They both remained silent for a few seconds while facing each other. Wu Chengyue didn’t make a move, neither did Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Even though they didn’t move, the others had all become nervous.</p> <p>Their hats were in the same style. Wu Chengyue’s hat was in camouflage color, while Lin Qiao’s was black.</p> <p>The one who made the other’s hat fall would be the winner!</p> <p>Both of them were preparing for attacking and defending at the same time, so neither of them launched the first strike. However, the longer they remained motionless, the more nervous the others got.</p> <p>“Come on…fight, fight…” suddenly, someone said with a low voice, and the others immediately turned to that man.</p> <p>“Eh…I was getting a little anxious!” After saying what he was thinking out loud, that man regretted it a little bit. Now, as the others were all eyeing him, he couldn’t help but explain with a low voice.</p> <p>Hearing that, the others turned back to Lin Qiao and Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>At that very moment, Lin Qiao moved, lunging and throwing a kick toward Wu Chengyue. Her movements were swift and powerful, such that her long leg even created a slight swishing noise while swinging across the air.</p> <p>Thud! Once Lin Qiao moved, Wu Chengyue moved as well. Lin Qiao was fast, but so was he.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao sent out the kick, Wu Chengyue made a step forward, turned his body, and raised a leg to kick the back of her lower leg. Meanwhile, he easily defended himself against Lin Qiao’s kick. In the next moment, while holding off Lin Qiao’s leg, he thrust his own leg to kick Lin her chest.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hurriedly pulled her leg back and turned her body. Meanwhile, she crossed her arms to defend against Wu Chengyue’s leg, and next, she pounced straight at Wu Chengyue’s face.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was over six feet tall, and had long legs. However, he was nimble enough. As Lin Qiao launched the punch, he raised an arm to shield his face while making a punch as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao fended herself against his fist. When Wu Chengyue pulled back his foot, she suddenly leaped up and kicked at his stomach.</p> <p>Within a short while, they had each made a series of attacks, yet neither of them managed to hurt each other, as none of their attacks worked. While defending themselves, they were also about to find chances to launch new attacks.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Lin Qiao didn’t feel anything particular, but the others were all dazzled, because both of them were way too fast!</p> <p>Within a blink, they had switched to quite a few new spots.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao grasped an opportunity to clasp Wu Chengyue’s fist which was coming at her, then pull him backward. Meanwhile, she lifted her thigh to knee his lower abdomen.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue dropped his eyes while shouting ‘Not good’ inside his head. Hurriedly, he bent slightly and turned his body. However, as Lin Qiao violently twisted his wrist, his body was pressed down to the ground.</p> <p>‘Damn! This woman is even stronger than a man!’ He couldn’t help but curse inside his head.</p> <p>After the knee attack failed, Lin Qiao grasped his arm with both hands and dragged him downward, then elbowed his face.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue quickly raised another hand to protect himself. At the same time, he put a foot against Lin Qiao’s foot, then pulled his arm hard to try and throw her away.</p> <p>If Lin Qiao were an ordinary human being, she might have flown out. Instead of that, she clenched Wu Chengyue’s hand and nimbly turned her body in the air, then agilely wrapped a leg around his neck. After that, she added another leg and brought his upper body down to the ground.</p> <p>Thud! Both of them fell on the concrete floor.</p> <p>“Ouch…That hurts!” The group of people were shocked by how they fell to the ground.</p> <p>“Em…” Wu Chengyue let out a muffled moan. As he realized what had happened, he found that his upper body was under Lin Qiao’s control, and that his hat was gone. His hand grabbed by her had been pulled upward, and she wasn’t loosening her grip at all. Her legs were crossed around his neck, tightly clamping his upper body.</p> <p>Then, something even worse happened. Lin Qiao suddenly pulled his arm backward, seeming about to break that arm.</p> <p>“Ah! F**k!” Wu Chengyue couldn’t help but give a howl. His face blushed because of the pain, and his veins bulged from his forehead. His blood surged up to his head, making him even stop thinking.</p> <p>He clenched his teeth so tight that even his masseter muscles swelled. However, he still clenched his fist without screaming out loud or kicking his legs to struggle. Instead, he suddenly fixed his eyes on Lin Qiao’s thigh which was right under his neck, then opened his mouth wide and made a large bite.</p> <p>“Roar!” Lin Qiao was going to let him go. She had taken off his hat, so she was already the winner. However, before she could make a move, her sensitive and tender thigh was suddenly bitten by Wu Chengyue. Being stimulated by the weird sting, Lin Qiao raised her head and gave a roar.</p> <p>As she raised her head, she unwittingly pulled Wu Chengyue’s arm further backward, which made Wu Chengyue suffer a huger pain!</p> <p>Feeling the pain, Wu Chengyue didn’t relax his bite, but bit even harder. And then, Lin Qiao suffered a greater pain.</p> <p>“F**K!” Lin Qiao who always talked slowly, couldn’t help but curse as well.</p> <p>At that point, the others had all burst into laughter.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s arm was about to be broken by Lin Qiao, while she was suffering from Wu Chengyue’s bite. What on earth were they doing? Couldn’t they engage in a decent fight?</p> <p>‘Chief, you have lost already! Why did you bite the lady’s thigh!’</p>",
  "Chapter 229: Someone Bit A Zombie": "<p>Lin Qiao didn’t know that she could sense pain again, and the pain seemed to be even more obvious than it should be. Was that an illusion? Or, were that man’s teeth too sharp?</p> <p>Lin Qiao was so unhappy right now. Her inner thigh was bitten by a man. She wanted to accuse that man of indecent assault!</p> <p>Except for the piercing pain, she had also sensed an itchy feeling from the area of her thigh which that man was still biting.</p> <p>‘Damn! Damn! Damn!’ She cursed inside while hurriedly letting go of that man’s arm.</p> <p>“Let…go…” she clenched her teeth and uncrossed her legs, then sat up to grip his neck.</p> <p>“Em…” As his arm was set free, Wu Chengyue relaxed his bite, then dragged Lin Qiao’s hand away from his neck and quickly stood up.</p> <p>“Pah!” While spitting saliva, he rubbed his arm which was nearly broken by Lin Qiao while she stared at him, rubbing her thigh. The others all laughed because of the weird posture that Lin Qiao and Wu Chengyue ended the fight with. None of them realized that the roar that Lin Qiao had let out because of the pain was not quite the same as the roars of healthy human beings.</p> <p>At first, it seemed to be a battle between two professionals, but unexpectedly, Wu Chengyue soon fell into Lin Qiao’s control. As a man, he might have greater strength than she did, but she was much nimbler than him.</p> <p>So at last, Lin Qiao quietly and skillfully suppressed Wu Chengyue. That was nothing abnormal, in fact; but to everyone’s surprise, the pretty decent fight suddenly turned into a wrestle between kids.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue, the strong man, bit his opponent! If it were Lin Qiao, who was a female, who made the bite, the group of people might be less shocked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up; her clothes had become a little messy because of the fight. The shirt wrapped around her shoulder had turned back, and her shirt had rolled up a little bit.</p> <p>She rubbed the tooth print on her thigh, then pointed at Wu Chengyue and said through gritted teeth, “You…bit…me!”</p> <p>She couldn’t even believe it! What the hell! As a zombie, she didn’t try to bite anyone! On the contrary, that man bit her! Thankfully, he didn’t bite through her skin and drank her blood. Otherwise, he might have become a zombie!</p> <p>However, that wasn’t what she was worried about. ‘Damn! I’m a zombie! I’m a zombie! Why on earth am I bitten by someone!’</p> <p>At the moment, Wu Chengyue finally realized what he had done. He blushed instantly, then made a fist with his unharmed hand and put it near his mouth as he coughed slightly. After that, he turned his face away.</p> <p>‘Damn! It’s so shameful! Why did I bite her! I’m not a dog! It’s so awkward now!’</p> <p>A series of laughter was suddenly heard. The group of people who were trying to keep themselves from laughing out loud all burst into laughter on hearing what Lin Qiao said.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi recovered from the shock, then also made a fist and put it near his mouth like Wu Chengyue did, and said, “Eh-hem, Chief, you lost! Your hat has fallen off.” While speaking, he pointed at the hat which was lying next to Lin Qiao’s feet.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned back and walked toward the stairs while responding, “I lost. I’ll forgive her for stealing my zombie nucleus.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at his back, thinking that maybe she should rush up and bite his neck right now. Seeing the look on her face, Lu Tianyi suddenly figured out what she was thinking. So, he hurriedly ran up to her and picked up his Chief’s hat.</p> <p>“Haha, in fact, you’ve made him suffer enough pain by trying to break his arm. Don’t get mad! But, when did you become so good at fighting? Did you…” He wanted to ask Lin Qiao if she learned how to fight after becoming a zombie.</p> <p>Li Qiao glanced at him. Her speed and reactions were indeed improved a lot after she became a zombie, but all her moves were created by herself back in the army.</p> <p>Her strength, speed, reaction had all improved drastically, but still, Wu Chengyue managed to engage in quite a long fight against her. That was already impressive! However, why did he bite her? Did he bite her because he couldn’t defeat her? Was he a dog?</p> <p>And, was he leaving? Wasn’t he even going to apologize for biting her?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue might have sensed Lin Qiao’s thought, as he stopped abruptly, then slightly turned his head and said to Lin Qiao with a low voice, “Em, just now…I’m sorry! And…Thank you for saving Ling Ling.”</p> <p>Having finished with that, he continued walking toward Xiao Yunlong and Wu Yueling while the others all stood up and followed him.</p> <p>“Chief, can we follow you?” Kong Qingming walked toward the stairs and said to Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>“Sure,” Wu Chengyue responded with a smile. Then, he turned to Xiao Yunlong and asked, “How’s Meng Yue? Is she injured badly? We need to send her back to the base if she’s not doing good.”</p> <p>“She has been starved for two days,” said Xiao Yunlong, “She fainted because she’s physically down. Her injuries aren’t so bad, but she has lost quite some blood.”</p> <p>Hearing the conversation between Wu Chengyue and Kong Qingming, Lu Tianyi knew that he should be leaving. But before that, he had another question for Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Where can I find you? Will you stay in the East?”</p> <p>Hearing him, Lin Qiao stopped staring at Wu Chengyue angrily, but turned to him and responded, “We’ll…meet…if…fate…says…so”</p> <p>She didn’t tell him that she might stay in this area, and that she would be with Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi continued staring at her. He waited for a few seconds, but she never said another word. After that, he sighed, turned and walked to Wu Chengyue and the others. But before leaving, the others all turned to Lin Qiao and one of them shouted, “Sister, are you going back to the base with us?”</p> <p>“Have you forgotten that she still has something to do? She stayed here because of us,” said Kong Qingming to those people.</p> <p>“Eh? Ah!” The group of people had nearly forgotten about that.</p> <p>“Sister, what’s your name? We don’t know your name yet!” Shouted Zheng Xiaonian.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming both turned to Lin Qiao with a weird look.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong also turned to Lin Qiao with curiosity. They wanted to know how Lin Qiao would introduce herself, and if they had heard her name before.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at them and said one word, “Lin…”</p> <p>Her voice was rather low, so Zheng Xiaonian and the others didn’t hear her clearly.</p> <p>“Eh? What did sister say just now? Did you hear it?”</p> <p>“Not quite clearly…”</p> <p>“She said ‘Lin’,” said Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>“Lin?”</p>",
  "Chapter 230: Another Invisible Zombie": "<p>Lu Tianyi, who stood near Lin Qiao, glanced at her with surprise, then guessed that she changed her name because people now believed that Lu Tianyu had died. After glancing at her once more, he turned back to follow the others.</p> <p>Xie Dong walked to Lin Qiao with the grey rabbit, then threw it at her.<br/>\nShe caught the rabbit and threw it into her space. Then, she walked to the guardrail and sat on it, turning around and putting both feet outside the building.</p> <p>While rubbing her thigh which was bitten by Wu Chengyue, she still felt shocked.</p> <p>‘Damn, isn’t it too weird for a man to bite someone else? And, as a zombie, I can actually feel pain! Is that because Viney has fixed my body?’</p> <p>She was now able to utter sounds and feel pain. And, her body seemed to be more sensitive than that of healthy human beings! Why? She was a zombie, so why on earth could she feel pain? Someone bit her, and that made her suffer like hell! So, if she ever got hurt during fights, she might die because of pain!</p> <p>She suddenly felt that being able to feel nothing was better than now!</p> <p>Xie Dong stood beside her as he took out the small notebook and wrote—’You seemed to be in pain just now!’</p> <p>Finishing writing, he showed Lin Qiao the question.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to read the note, then took off her sunglasses and wiped them with her shirt. Meanwhile, she replied, “Very…painful…”</p> <p>‘Seem? It hurts like hell!’ She thought.</p> <p>She wiped off the dust on the sunglasses, then prepared to put it back on. But suddenly, she paused and turned her head, her sharp eyes fixed on the other side of the roof.</p> <p>Xie Dong turned to that direction as well but saw nothing. He turned back to Lin Qiao with confusion, as he didn’t know what she had seen.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stared at that area, then flipped back and jumped off the guardrail. She faced that area coldly and said two words, “Come…out!”</p> <p>Xie Dong wasn’t able to see it, but unlike him, Lin Qiao quickly closed her eyes and detected a green sphere of energy in that area, remaining motionless.</p> <p>She blinked before putting on the sunglasses, and within that moment, she saw the green energy out of the corners of her eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s reaction made Xie Dong alert as both of them quietly looked at that area. Xie Dong was still searching for the target, yet Lin Qiao had her eyes fixed on it.</p> <p>Soon, the owner of the green energy showed her face, maybe because she had realized that Lin Qiao had discovered her.</p> <p>A young female zombie who had half a face covered in scales slowly showed up. She angrily stared at Lin Qiao, then suddenly bared her teeth and roared out loud.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n‘It’s you! You stole my little sister!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Xie Dong were both surprised a little. The young female zombie was a conscious zombie queen.<br/>\n‘When did Wu Yueling become your little sister?’ Lin Qiao thought, ‘She has a father! You stole her from her family, so how dare you accuse me of stealing your little sister?’</p> <p>“She…has…family…’ Lin Qiao said to the young female zombie. She wanted to tell her that it was wrong for her to steal the child, because the child’s family would worry about her.</p> <p>The young female zombie was puzzled at first, then continued staring at Lin Qiao with anger.</p> <p>“Roarrrrr!”<br/>\n‘But she’s adorable. I like her very much.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her brows, looking at the young female zombie with confusion. She felt that the zombie was a little silly. Ling Ling was adorable indeed, but she didn’t belong to the zombie. The zombie was free to adore her, but shouldn’t steal her.</p> <p>“You…can…like…her, but…can’t…kidnap…her…” She explained to the young fame zombie patiently. Hearing that, the zombie snorted, then continued roaring.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n‘I like her! Why can’t I kidnap her? I’m bored alone, so I want her to play with me! I didn’t hurt her! You all think that I’ll hurt her!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded. She believed the zombie because when she found the little one with this zombie, the other acted very carefully, as if Ling Ling was her cherished toy. But…</p> <p>“Because…you…don’t…look…like…a…good…person, and, you…are…a…zombie…” Lin Qiao pointed at her own face and said to the young female zombie.</p> <p>Hearing that, the zombie immediately disagreed and burst in screams.</p> <p>“Roar! Roarrrrr!”<br/>\n‘I don’t know what a zombie is! I know that I’m ugly, but I don’t know why I became so ugly! I always looked like this! I don’t even remember who I am…I don’t care…I want my little sister! I want her!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little speechless, as she felt that the young female zombie was acting like a little kid who was crying for candy. She turned to make eye-contact with Xie Dong.</p> <p>At that moment, the young female zombie suddenly wore a different look as she stared at her with a dark and icy-cold face while uttering a deep growl.</p> <p>“Roarrrrrr…”<br/>\n‘I don’t care. I want you to take me to my little sister, or I’ll bite you to death!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t understand why the zombie abruptly began to threaten her.</p> <p>“Why…don’t…you…go…yourself?” Asked Lin Qiao.</p> <p>The young female zombie crossed her arms before her chest, then curved her lips downward as she snorted and replied, “Hem…Roar…oar…”<br/>\n‘Because it seems that they won’t kill you. If I go, the man who fought you will definitely kill me.’</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao immediately figured out that the young female zombie was afraid of level-seven superpowered human beings. As a zombie queen, her instincts might have been telling her to stay away from level-seven human beings. However, she was able to turn herself invisible, so she should be able to sneakily approach Wu Yueling.</p> <p>“I…am…busy…” Lin Qiao spread her hands and said. She didn’t have the time to care about this strange young female zombie! The zombie was able to turn herself invisible, but so was she! In the worst case, she could just hide in her space. She wasn’t afraid of the young female zombie even though she wasn’t able to defeat her in a face-to-face battle.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s worse, the young female zombie was infuriated right away. She glared at Lin Qiao, bared her teeth, and gave another roar.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n‘Aren’t you afraid that I might beat you!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned around, grabbed Xie Dong, then flashed into her space.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao turned around, the young female zombie moved as well. She lunged at her as fast as a bolt of lightning, but when she darted to where she was, the two were both gone.</p> <p>She paused a little, then looked around in a panic. Then, she realized that Lin Qiao had disappeared from this place. The young female zombie screamed, unwilling to give up.</p> <p>“Roar!”<br/>\n‘I’ll find you!’</p>",
  "Chapter 231: Stingy Man": "<p>After entering her space, Lin Qiao let go of Xie Dong, then closed her eyes, turned herself invisible, and went outside. Hearing the young female zombie’s unhappy and unruly roars, she only gave a faint smile. Then, she turned around and leaped off the building to leave.</p> <p>She needed to accomplish her task. Lu Tianyi, his people, and the little one had disrupted her plans multiple times, so she hadn’t gotten the time to look for the information about supply storages.</p> <p>On the other side, Lu Tianyi asked Xiao Yunlong while moving forward with his team, “How did you run into that zombie queen? What power does it have?”</p> <p>The others also curiously turned to Xiao Yunlong who was carrying Meng Yue. They all wanted to know how he let the zombie take away the little princess.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong replied, “It came to us, and even Meng Yue didn’t sense it. By the time we discovered it, it was already at our door. We jumped out of the window, but it was swift and traceless. We drove the car, but before we could go far, it turned our car upside down. Meng Yue and Ling Ling were in the car. When I got there, Ling Ling had disappeared.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, he lowered his head, seeming to be a little upset.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue carried his daughter as he rubbed her back. He sensed that the energy inside her daughter’s body seemed to be reaching a breakthrough. He wondered if his daughter’s power was going to be triggered.</p> <p>He turned to look at Lu Tianyi and the others, then asked, “That…with that woman…How did you meet Ling Ling and that zombie queen? And you were brave enough to take Ling Ling back from it…How did you do that?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming both smiled. “Not us, it was her alone,” Lu Tianyi said. Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong looked at them with surprise, waiting for their explanation.</p> <p>“She has a space,” said Kong Qingming, “We were in somewhere else half a month ago. We were caught by a group of level-five zombies, and were driven to Upper City District. She showed up suddenly and saved all of us. Afterward, we rested in her space. We don’t know what happened before she brought Ling Ling in the space.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong glanced at each other, then turned to look at Ling Ling. Wu Chengyue sighed in relief gratefully, then said, “Fortunately, the zombie queen didn’t hurt Ling Ling, or…”</p> <p>“What plan do you have right now?” Asked Xiao Yunlong, “I think your zombie nucleus is stolen, isn’t it? Should we go find another level-six zombie? Speaking of which, I think you’re too stingy. She saved Ling Ling, yet you tried to hold onto the zombie nucleus. It’s not too much at all to pay her with the zombie nucleus for your daughter’s life, is it?”</p> <p>Even though the conversations that Xiao Yunlong heard just now at the roof confused him, but from those, he still learned something important—the woman who was bitten by Wu Chengyue stole his zombie nucleus. Judging by how angry he was, she should have stolen that thunder-powered nucleus.</p> <p>The others all nodded in agreement.</p> <p>“True!” Those people didn’t know that the nice and gentle Wu Chengyue could actually be so stingy. Wu Chengyue glanced at Xiao Yunlong with a faint smile while saying, “Is this the first day you came to know me? Besides, haven’t I let her go? I’ve thanked her…and if she ever needs my help in the future, I’ll help her.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong rolled his eyes and responded, “You bit her! You lost the fight, and you actually bit her! I can’t even believe that you did it!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave him a sideways glance, then smiled and said, “What did you say? I didn’t hear you clearly.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong immediately turned to a wall and said, “You’re a stingy man… You’re always like that! Don’t deny!”</p> <p>At the moment, the others had all been eyeing Wu Chengyue with surprise. They somehow felt that they had known something important, and began to worry if he would kill them to keep them silent.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled again and replied, “Yeah, I’m always stingy, so what? Let’s return to our campsite as soon as possible. Meng Yue isn’t doing good. Why did you bring her here?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong glanced at Meng Yue who was lying on his back, then said, “We came here to tell you what happened to Ling Ling, but it started raining. And, I don’t know if the zombie queen will go back to the campsite or not.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at him, remaining silent. But suddenly, he recalled the rabbit which jumped out of Ling Ling’s arms earlier, and felt that it looked familiar.</p> <p>Why didn’t that woman eat the rabbit? Why did she keep it? He felt that he just couldn’t understand women.</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao spent a few days in searching through the entire West Lake District, finally locating the Planning Bureau. At the same time, the young female zombie had been trying to find her. However, no one could find the invisible Lin Qiao currently.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found lots of maps in the Planning Bureau, with which, she now had a much clearer understanding of Hangzhou City geographically.</p> <p>According to the marks on some maps, she found quite some storages. Rice, flour, oil, salt, and some other food supplies were well preserved. About thirty percent of them had gone bad, but the rest were still edible.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put a good amount of rice, salt, and some other food which were packed with vacuum into her space.</p> <p>Her mission was accomplished. She had checked the city and found some nice places. However, that young female zombie could still be a trouble. So, she decided to let Qiu Lili handle her.</p> <p>She found a drivable car from a car shop, then began driving back. Next day, she returned to the hotel in Linan City, where Lin Feng and his people were staying.</p> <p>At about five meters from the hotel, she found a great number of zombies crowding on the road. As she released her vibe, the zombies immediately moved away and made a path for her. However, they didn’t seem to leave.</p> <p>After Lin Qiao passed, they jammed the road again,</p> <p>After driving through the zombie wall, Lin Qiao stuck her head out of the car window to look at those zombies. Then, she found that they were all facing the outside or walking around.</p> <p>She guessed that Qiu Lili might have given them some kind of order.</p> <p>Taking her head back, she continued driving toward the hotel. Soon, she parked by the hotel and saw the two children playing around.</p> <p>“Tongtong, this way, this way…Haha…Come and get me…” Lin Xiaolu’s silvery voice was heard. The two children were chasing each other on the broad parking lot.</p> <p>“Em…em…Don’t run…” Tong Tong shouted behind Lin Xiaolu.</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue and Junjun sat by a flower nursery nearby, watching the two kids while chatting. “You don’t remember anything, so if you saw the man who abandoned you two one day, will you remember him?” Cheng Wangxue asked.</p>",
  "Chapter 232: Maybe Abandon": "<p>Junjun looked at her confusedly, then wrote on a notebook—’How do you know that he abandoned us? Maybe he has become a zombie, or died.’</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue looked at her, then at Tong Tong. “My feeling is always right,” she said, “If he didn’t abandon you, why were you in that room with Tong Tong alone? If Lu Tianyu didn’t pass by that area, you two might have still been locked in that building. You told me that the gate downstairs was locked. Do you think it was you or someone else who locked it?” While speaking, she turned back to Junjun.</p> <p>Junjun frowned slightly, then shook her head and wrote—’I remember that it was locked from the outside, so I couldn’t unlock it. I don’t remember anything else.’</p> <p>She paused slightly, then continued writing—’Maybe you’re right. I don’t know if I can still recognize him or not, because I don’t remember anything that happened in the past.’</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue looked at her in the eyes and said, “It’s alright, Tong Tong has you! You’re his mother, so you’ll protect him, right?”</p> <p>Junjun nodded while affectionately looking at Tong Tong, who was chasing Lin Xiaolu. After that, Cheng Wangxue pointed at her eyes and continued, “The dark circles under your eyes are becoming smaller and smaller, and your eye color is turning deeper. Are you upgrading soon?”</p> <p>Junjun touched her eye sockets, then wrote to respond—’I’m not sure, but I do have a strange feeling.’</p> <p>“The water that Lu Tianyu left us is truly effective. Even my foot is recovering much quicker than before. We haven’t been taking any medicines at all,” said Cheng Wangxue, and Junjun smiled at her in response.</p> <p>Recently, she bathed in the tubful of water that Lin Qiao left for her every single day. Even though the latter told her that she should run the water off after two bathes, she didn’t want to waste it. So, she bathed in it for a few days in a row.</p> <p>Of course, she would roughly clean herself before getting into the tub.</p> <p>‘In fact, you can do a foot soak with the lake water. Your foot might recover even quicker that way,’ she thought for a moment and wrote.</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue shook her head and said, “No, water is too precious in this world, so how can I soak my foot in it? We’re lucky to be here. If you go to the North or Northeast, you’ll know how precious the water is. The environment is tough over there. The world outside the bases is occupied by sandstorm and smog. People need to wear respirators or masks when getting out.”</p> <p>Junjun smilingly nodded at her. At that moment, a white figure flashed down from the roof and landed beside them.</p> <p>“Ahyayaya…” Qiu Lili yelled at them.</p> <p>“What did she say?” Cheng Wangxue looked at Qiu Lili with confusion, then turned to Junjun and asked. The latter stood up and wrote—’She’s back.’</p> <p>“Who’s she?” Cheng Wangxue asked. But then, she quickly thought of a possibility and asked another question, “Is Lu Tianyu back?”</p> <p>Junjun and Qiu Lili nodded at her. Soon, they heard the noises created by a car and saw a car driving over. The car was parked in the parking lot, then a woman wearing a hat got out of it.</p> <p>Seeing her, Qiu Lili flashed to Lin Qiao’s side.</p> <p>“Ahya? Ah? Ahh…”<br/>\n‘How’s it going? Have you found the place? When can we move over?’</p> <p>While walking, Lin Qiao said to her, ‘I…found…a…great…place, We…can…go…anytime, but…’</p> <p>She abruptly paused, then turned to Qiu Lili and continued, “Before…that, I…have…a…favor…to…ask…you…”</p> <p>Qiu Lili paused as well, waiting for her to finish her words with a struggling look, then asked, “Yah?”<br/>\n‘What favor?’</p> <p>‘There…is…a…zombie…at…your…level…You…may…need…to…deal…with…her…’</p> <p>Qiu Lili covered her forehead with a hand. As Lin Qiao finished talking, she couldn’t help but burst in yells.<br/>\n“Ahyayayayay…”<br/>\n‘When can you talk at normal speed? It hurts to hear you talking!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled a little embarrassedly and responded, “Soon…”</p> <p>Qiu Lili looked at her with a sullen pout. At that moment, Junjun and Cheng Wangxue also seemed to be struggling.</p> <p>Seriously, listening to her did require great patience!</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked toward the hotel, and the others followed behind her. She went upstairs, first returning to Qiu Lili and Junjun’s room, and also asking Cheng Wangxue to inform Lin Feng that they’d have a meeting tomorrow to talk about the serious matters.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao brought Xie Dong out of her space. After that, they each went back to their own rooms.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked into Junjun’s room, closed the door, then observed Junjun and said to her, “You…upgrade…soon?”</p> <p>Junjun nodded. Indeed, she was going to upgrade soon.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, said, “I…get…in…first. After…I…fix…my…voice, I’ll…let…you…go…down…there…”</p> <p>She meant letting Junjun go down the lake to receive treatment from Viney. During these days, Viney had completely absorbed the energy in the zombie nucleus and turned that energy into its own. Viney also needed to vent that energy by treating Lin Qiao and her friends.</p> <p>Both Qiu Lili and Junjun understood her. Junjun nodded, then watched Lin Qiao enter her space from the room.</p> <p>After entering, Lin Qiao slightly narrowed her eyes to observe the color of the lake water. The color had turned much deeper than before, the dark green water waving in the lake.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao entered the space, a thick vine rose from the water. Earlier on, the vine that came out of the lake was as thick as a finger, but this time, it was at the size of an arm.</p> <p>The vine wagged above the water surface, as if it were summoning her. Lin Qiao understood that Viney was indeed summoning her.</p> <p>She stood by the lake, took off her hat and sunglasses, and untied the cloth around her shoulder. Then, she took off her vest and trousers, and then her underwear.</p> <p>After that, she took off her shoes and walked toward the water.</p> <p>Her skin was glowing white, the waist was soft and slim, her legs were long and straight, and breasts were round and full… Lu Tianyu did have a nice body, if only her breasts could be smaller…</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently wished. After all, the huge breasts could bring her lots of inconveniences.</p> <p>She lowered her head to find two rows of dark-purple toothmarks on the middle of her right inner thigh.</p> <p>‘That snotty man!’ She cursed silently.</p> <p>Stepping into the water, she caught a cool feeling from her feet. The sensations of her body had come back, so she was now able to feel temperatures too. She found that she liked coolness more, and couldn’t stand hotness.</p> <p>If she didn’t need to carry any missions, she wouldn’t want to endure any hotness at all. However, if she did need to fulfill a task, her mindset would be different.</p> <p>As she got into the water, Viney quickly coiled around her and gently dragged her deeper into the lake. As the water reached her chest, more vines wrapped around her.</p> <p>‘Mama, it’s not gonna hurt this time…It’s gonna be quick!’ She heard Viney’s voice. Lin Qiao nodded inside, then said to Viney, ‘Good. Later on, I’ll go out and send Junjun in. Can you cure her?’</p> <p>‘Yes, yes, no problem!’ Viney agreed quickly.</p> <p>‘Good baby!’ Lin Qiao couldn’t help but chuckle in her head. Hearing that, Viney paused suddenly, then began wriggling.</p> <p>‘Wahhhh, Mama is praising me…So happy, happy…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know how to respond.</p>",
  "Chapter 233: Her Voice Is Fixed": "<p>The gentle energy slowly seeped into her body through her pores, gathering toward her stomach, chest, and head. Lin Qiao didn’t feel any pain this time, only some heat in the stomach and a slight dizziness. Unwittingly, she fell asleep.</p> <p>This time, she felt completely different from before. She didn’t even know what happened before waking up to find herself lying on a bed.</p> <p>It seemed that Viney had sent her up and put her on the bed.</p> <p>She sat up on the soft bed, looking at her stomach; the color of the membrane on her stomach had turned deeper. She pressed it and felt that it was soft, not quite like the stomach of a healthy human being. She had no idea what was under that membrane.</p> <p>“Viney?” She raised her eyes to look at the lake, then tried to call Viney’s name. But then, she was startled on hearing herself as she touched her throat and murmured to herself, “My voice is…fixed?”</p> <p>Hearing her voice, a few thick vines immediately rose from the lake, dancing above the water, as if responding to her. Lin Qiao glanced around and found her clothes at the end of the bed. After dressing up, she walked to the lakeside.</p> <p>“Thank you, Viney!”</p> <p>She didn’t know exactly what kind of creature Viney was, but she was grateful to it as it had healed her body. Viney reached a vine to the lakeside and coiled around her foot.</p> <p>‘Mama, don’t thank me! Viney exists because of Mama, so helping Mama is helping Viney!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted and picked up the vine from her foot, looking at it as she asked, “Why do you have to call me Mama? Why don’t you call me Sister?”</p> <p>‘Why Sister? Mama, you told me to call you Mama,’ replied Viney confusedly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao paused slightly in response, wondering when she told Viney to call her Mama.</p> <p>“I told you to? When? How come I don’t remember it?”</p> <p>Viney stayed silent for a while, then responded, ‘Em…em…em…I think it was a long, long time ago. I don’t remember either, but I remember some of the words that Mama said…’</p> <p>“Some of the words I said?” Lin Qiao was even more surprised.</p> <p>Viney nimbly pressed her palms a few times with the end of the vine. Lin Qiao spent a while looking at the vine bewilderedly, then failed to recall when she told Viney to call her Mama.</p> <p>“Alright, call me Mama if you like. Can I bring Junjun in now? I think she’s going to upgrade soon, and I guess she’ll activate a superpower.”</p> <p>Viney again pressed Lin Qiao’s palm with the end of the vine, then responded, ‘Sure, sure…Mama, bring her in!’ Viney still had a great amount of energy, but Mama’s body couldn’t contain it all.</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao stood up and dropped the vine, then disappeared. After coming out, she looked outside the window and found that it was already dark. Qiu Lili and Junjun were getting a little bored waiting for her in the room. As she showed up, both of them immediately turned to her.</p> <p>Qiu Lili ran up to Lin Qiao, circling around her and looking at her from head to toe.</p> <p>“Ahyayaya….Ahya…Ah…”<br/>\n‘You look the same as before. I thought your hair would grow out,’ said Qiu Lili</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised a hand to touch her bald head, then sighed and said, “Em, the hair haven’t grown, but my throat is fixed.”</p> <p>She smoothly finished one sentence without pausing, even though her voice was still hoarse and unpleasant to hear. As expected, both Qiu Lili and Junjun looked at her with surprise.</p> <p>Junjun had been silent the whole time. She only watched quietly most of the time; if she wanted to say something, she would write.</p> <p>Unlike her, Qiu Lili liked to talk in zombie language, even though some of the others couldn’t understand her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to Junjun and said, “Are you ready now?”</p> <p>Junjun glanced at Tong Tong who was lying on the bed asleep, then nodded. Lin Qiao too glanced at the asleep little boy, then held Junjun’s hands and disappeared together with her.</p> <p>Qiu Lili took a circle in the room, then sat back into the couch next to the bed, feeling bored again.</p> <p>“Viney.” After entering the space, Lin Qiao shouted at the lake. Following her voice, a few arm-thick vines started dancing above the water. Junjun looked at those vines which looked much stronger than before, then turned to Lin Qiao without knowing what to do.</p> <p>“Junjun, take off your clothes and go down the lake.” While speaking, Lin Qiao turned back and picked up a glass. Then, she walked to the lake, filled it with water, and began drinking. Meanwhile, she pointed at the lake.</p> <p>Junjun glanced at her, feeling a little shy. After that, she turned and began stripping with her back toward Lin Qiao. Looking at her, Lin Qiao knew that she was shy. So, after finishing drinking, Lin Qiao walked toward the strawberry field with the glass.</p> <p>“Don’t worry, I won’t peek. Besides, I’m a woman too. Why’re you feeling shy?”</p> <p>Junjun smiled embarrassedly, and unbuttoned her clothes slightly quicker than before. However, she had no idea that Lin Qiao was able to see her without turning around if she wanted to.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked a strawberry and put it in the glass. The average-sized glass was only able to contain two or three strawberries, so Lin Qiao held the glass with one hand and picked three more strawberries with her other hand.</p> <p>As she turned back, Junjun and Viney had both disappeared. However, she was able to feel Junjun, who was now down in the lake.</p> <p>At the moment, Junjun was dragged to the bottom of the lake by countless vines. The vines wrapped her, making her feel a wave of numbness and stinging from every corner of her body.</p> <p>Something had entered her body. She didn’t know what it was, because she had started to feel a swelling pain from her head. The headache disabled her sensations and blurred her mind.</p> <p>But gradually, some disordered images emerged in her mind.</p> <p>At first, she saw many people, all moving toward one direction. The surrounding environment was changing constantly, so was the number of those people. At last, those people seemed to be desperate, some even having an emotional breakdown.</p> <p>They had no water, food, or weapons, so the leaders of this group of people planned to sneakily abandon some people.</p> <p>As a result, she and her son were abandoned. To protect her child from being hurt by her former teammates who had become zombies, she and a man risked their lives to escape with the child. But at last, she was still bitten by a zombie.</p> <p>Then, that man took away the water and food that she had left to her son. As she lapsed into unconsciousness, that man sneakily left her and the child.</p> <p>The images in her head weren’t coherent, but were clear. Seeing those, she slowly remembered many things.</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue was right. She and her son were abandoned indeed; they were abandoned by that man.</p> <p>With that realization, an intense hatred began spreading in her heart.</p>",
  "Chapter 234: Junjun Is Cured": "<p>Lin Qiao stood by the lake to feel the changes happening down in the lake. She found that the energy contained in the lake water was moving toward the center, emerging and gathering wave after wave.</p> <p>Later on, she turned and walked into the strawberry field. She found some weeds among the plants there, so she squatted to remove them.</p> <p>She didn’t know how long it would take for Viney to cure Junjun, so she decided to weed the strawberry and vegetable fields. Junjun was responsible for that work before, but as the fields hadn’t been weeded for a couple of days, quite some weeds had grown out.</p> <p>After spending a while doing that, Lin Qiao sensed no change from Junjun. So, she exited her space. Once out, she saw Qiu Lili squatting by Tong Tong’s bedside, looking at his sleeping face. Her arms were crossed by the edge of the bed, chin rested on her arms.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao come out, she immediately turned and stood up.</p> <p>“Ahyayaya…Ahyaya…”<br/>\n‘You’re out? Where’s Junjun?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao put a finger before her lips and shushed her, then said with a low voice, “Keep your voice low…Don’t wake him up. If he wakes up but can’t find his Mom, he’ll burst out crying.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili glanced at Tong Tong with fear. Finding that the kid was showing no sign of waking up, she sighed with relief.</p> <p>If the little boy started crying, even the ceiling would fall off.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili walked to the couch and sat down. “Junjun is still in the lake,” Lin Qiao said with a gentle voice, “I don’t know how long it’ll take. Let’s wait! Hopefully, she’ll come out before dawn, because no one else can keep this kid quiet.”</p> <p>“Ahyaah…” said Qiu Lili with a low voice.<br/>\n‘Please, Junjun, please come out quick.”</p> <p>After murmuring in prayer, Qiu Lili suddenly recalled what Lin Qiao had mentioned earlier when she returned. So, she asked, “Ahyaya, yayayaaaayayaya…”<br/>\n‘You said that I need to deal with a zombie. Is it also at level-six? What kind? How does it look? Is it ugly?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao pictured that young female zombie in her head. She wasn’t ugly; at least, she was relatively good-looking among zombies.</p> <p>“She seems to be at your age, not ugly. Half of her face is covered in scales. She seems to still have some humanity, but her temper is weird. Her mood is always changing. In fact, I felt that she’s not evil, but a little self-willed. When you fight her, don’t kill her, and just drive her away,” Lin Qiao said.</p> <p>Hearing that, Qiu Lili looked at her with surprise and asked, “Ahahyiaaaaa?”<br/>\n‘At my age? What do you mean she’s not evil? Should I beat her or not?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled and said, “I think you still need to teach her a lesson, so she’ll know that there are some things she shouldn’t do. But, I don’t know what power she has. She can turn invisible like me. So, I can’t tell which one of you is stronger.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili looked at Lin Qiao. She was very curious about this zombie who was as powerful as she was.</p> <p>“Ah…Yayaaaa?” She asked.<br/>\n‘Does she have memories like me? Have she killed anyone before?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao recalled that young female zombie’s behavior and said, “I didn’t see her killing anyone, but she seems to like doing bad things. She also seems to like children. Although she wouldn’t hurt children, it’s not right to steal children from their parents.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili stared at Lin Qiao with shock, “Ah…Yaya? Ahh?”<br/>\n‘Steal…the children of the others? Is she a human trader?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao smilingly looked at her and said, “Perhaps…it had a childish reason for doing so.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that moment, Junjun was suffering an immense pain at the bottom of the lake. The pain from her body and from her memories both made her want to scream. However, her face and mouth were covered by something soft, which disabled her from shouting out loud even though she had opened her mouth.</p> <p>‘Ahhhhh…Huang Tianfei! You bas*ard! I won’t forgive you! You animals! You cruel thing!’ She roared in her heart.</p> <p>That man abandoned her and her son. She could forgive him for leaving her, but could never forgive him for abandoning Tong Tong and taking away the only food and water they had! Lots of memory pieces wove in her mind, connecting with each other and becoming coherent memories.</p> <p>She remembered; she and those people escaped from the Hades Base. Huang Feitian and five level-five superpowered people sneakily brought their families out of the base, heading to Sea City.</p> <p>The few level-five people might have heard that the Hades Base would suffer attacks. So, they gathered a group of people and quietly left the base.</p> <p>Junjun didn’t know what was going on at that time. She only knew that Huang Feitian came back in haste, quickly packed their bags, and took her and her son out of the base. He didn’t tell her anything, so she was brought out of the base without knowing why.</p> <p>But now, based on what Lin Qiao had told her, she figured out that he knew that the base would be attacked at that time.</p> <p>‘Lin Qiao…Lin Qiao! Chief Netherworld Fire!’</p> <p>Suddenly, Junjun thought of something. However, before she could think carefully, a wave of energy exploded inside her head, just like an exploding bomb that shattered all the memories in her head.</p> <p>After that, the energy began swelling inside her head like a balloon, as if it was going to make her head explode.</p> <p>‘Em…Ahhhh!’</p> <p>Suffering the great pain in her head, Junjun couldn’t help but growl silently. The energy expanded further and further. As she felt that her head was already as huge as a basketball court, the energy suddenly shrank and went back into the center of her brain.</p> <p>Junjun relaxed her body. She wanted to gasp for air, but the thing that covered her mouth and nose wouldn’t allow her to do that. At that moment, the energy slowly concentrated in the middle of her brain, and soon, it released a small stream of energy and sent it to the rest of her body through her neck.</p> <p>Before long, Lin Qiao, who was talking with Qiu Lili about that young female zombie, felt something.</p> <p>“I think Junjun is coming out. I’ll get in and check,” she said. While speaking, she turned around and entered her space.</p> <p>Standing by the lake, she found that the water level was rising.</p> <p>Where did the water come from? She had been wondering why there was a lake filled with water in her space, and where that water was from.</p> <p>At the moment, the amount of water seemed to be increasing, but she didn’t know where its source was.</p> <p>Abruptly, a large wave rose from the water surface, then slowly calmed down. After that, a figure came out of the lake surface, swimming toward Lin Qiao.</p>",
  "Chapter 235: Do You Know Me?": "<p>Lin Qiao picked up Junjun’s clothes from the ground as the latter came out of the water. When Junjun walked up to her, she handed her the clothes.</p> <p>“How’s it? Your power?” Lin Qiao had sensed Junjun’s power level: she was already a level-four zombie by now. At the same time, she also sensed her complicated and disordered feelings, including hatred, anger, disappointment, shock, confusion and disbelief.</p> <p>‘What happened to her?’ Lin Qiao looked at Junjun confusedly.</p> <p>Junjun slightly lowered her head as she took over the clothes and dressed herself. Having finished dressing up, she slightly raised her head to look at Lin Qiao with a complicated expression, then said with a low voice, “Chief!”</p> <p>“Eh?” Lin Qiao stared at her bewilderedly. Then, she popped her eyes in shock and responded, “You can talk? So soon! Wait a moment, what did you call me just now?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Junjun’s face and found that the dark circles under her eyes were gone. Her pale-grey eyes had turned entirely black, and her pupils were invisible.</p> <p>Junjun pulled her long wet hair to one side, wringing them while saying, “Em, I feel that a long time has passed. I remembered things, about myself, and you.”</p> <p>Finishing the sentence, she turned to look at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Eh? Do you know me from before?” Lin Qiao looked at her with confusion as she asked, “But tell me first, why did you call me Chief? You’re not seeing me as the other Lin Qiao, are you?”</p> <p>Junjun continued to wring her long hair while replying, “Chief, you saved Lin Feng, Madam, and the others, so, you are her, aren’t you? Have you lost your memories like I did? Or, have you only forgotten the things that happened in the recent five years?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao paused briefly. She suddenly felt that Junjun’s words had triggered something in her head and caused a slight swelling pain in her brain.</p> <p>“Eh…” She raised a hand to cover her forehead while frowning and moaning.</p> <p>Junjun was startled. “What’s wrong? Do you remember anything?” She asked nervously.</p> <p>Lin Qiao kept the hand on her forehead while shaking her head as she responded, “No, just having a headache!”</p> <p>Junjun sighed slightly with relief, then said, “As long as you’re okay…I think headache can be normal. After all, you’re using a new body now, so I guess something in your mind is sealed.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her head to look at Junjun, then asked, “How do you know that I’m Chief Netherworld Fire? I have completely no idea when I served as a Chief.” While speaking, she walked to Qiu Lili’s closet, found a dry towel, and handed it to Junjun.</p> <p>Junjun took over the towel and thanked Lin Qiao, then continued, “Because I feel that you are her. You’re Lin Qiao, aren’t you? You just lost a part of your memories, just like me.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her, staying silent. She thought for a moment, then decided to try figuring it out. What Junjun said was reasonable though.</p> <p>“Perhaps, you’re right,” she nodded and said, “But, my memory ends before the apocalypse. I thought I died when the apocalypse happened, then woke up inside Lu Tianyu’s body.”</p> <p>“Five years is such a huge time gap,” said Junjun smilingly, “That’s not scientific!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed and said in agreement, “You’re right! So, I’ve been feeling weird about it. Alright, enough about me. Let’s talk about you. I detected a negative vibe from you just now. Have you remembered something bad?”</p> <p>Speaking of that, Junjun’s face darkened immediately.</p> <p>“My name is Liu Jun,” she said, “Tong Tong’s full name is Huang Yuetong, and Tong Tong is his nickname. He’s four years old. My ex-husband’s name is Huang Tianfei. We were living a good life in the Hades Base, but two months ago, he came back home suddenly and brought us out of the base with some other people in a hurry. We were heading to Sea City.”</p> <p>While speaking, Liu Jun’s vibe began unstable again as waves of hatred and killing intent began radiating from her body.</p> <p>“But, the journey was too long, with many zombies on our way. We encountered zombie leaders a few times, and most of us were killed by the zombies. At first, the ones with powers protected us who didn’t have powers, as well as the children. But gradually, they started seeing us a burden. Later on, many of the ordinary ones were pushed out by them under dangerous situations to hold off zombies or serve as baits.” While speaking, Liu Jun slowly squatted on the ground.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was able to feel her hatred, sadness, and deep regret.</p> <p>“We were abandoned at last,” Liu Jun continued, “I begged Huang Feitian not to leave us. I begged him to at least take Tong Tong to Sea City safely. But, he didn’t. He heartlessly discarded us, taking away the food and water I had left for Tong Tong.”</p> <p>“How did you manage to hide in that building after being bitten by a zombie?” Lin Qiao asked out of curiosity.</p> <p>Liu Jun responded, “I was pushed toward the zombies by Huang Feitian. After I was bitten, he locked me in a room. I was unconscious for a few days. When I woke up, he and the others had left. They didn’t bring Tong Tong with them, and I found my son in another room.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed, not knowing what to say about that man. She guessed that under desperate situations, all kinds of relationship would become fake to him, and he would do anything for survival.</p> <p>“I can’t forgive him for leaving Tong Tong…I can’t…” Liu Jun murmured as her sadness instantly turned into hatred. Lin Qiao patted her on the shoulder and said, “Alright! You see, Tong Tong is healthy right now. Cheer up!”</p> <p>“If you didn’t find us, Tong Tong would have been gone!” Liu Jun raised her head to look at Lin Qiao, her dark eyes revealing no emotions. However, Lin Qiao still felt that Junjun was honestly grateful for her.</p> <p>“Alright, let’s get out,” said Lin Qiao, “I was worrying that you might stay in the lake for too long. If you’re not there when Tong Tong wakes up, Qiu Lili and I will suffer.”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded and stood up. Lin Qiao then held her hand, and both of them exited the space.</p> <p>Qiu Lili was leaning against the window, looking at the dark sky outside. Sensing the two, she immediately turned back to look at Junjun.</p> <p>“Ahyayay…”<br/>\n‘How’s it going? How do you feel?’</p> <p>While yelling, she flashed to Liu Jun’s side and made a circle around her, then began observing her carefully. She found that Junjun’s appearance didn’t change a lot, but her eyes and vibe had changed thoroughly. She was different than before, not drastically though. Moreover, her power level was improved largely.</p> <p>Liu Jun walked to Tong Tong and bent over to rub her son’s hair, then gently kissed his forehead.</p> <p>“It’s great to meet Chief…” she said with a soft voice.</p>",
  "Chapter 236: The Place Where You Died": "<p>“Ah! Ahyayaya…Ahyaya…”<br/>\n‘Junjun, you can talk! So quickly! I want to be able to talk too!’</p> <p>Finding that Liu Jun was able to talk, Qiu Lili immediately got excited and turned to yell at Lin Qiao, who smiled and responded, “I need to ask Viney first. I don’t know if it has used the energy up.”</p> <p>“Chief, did you discover your space recently?” Liu Jun asked curiously, “I didn’t hear you mention your space power before. And, that thing in the lake…What is it?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt weird on hearing Junjun call her ‘Chief’, so she said, “Eh, don’t call me that. The others might feel strange about it.”</p> <p>Liu Jun paused briefly, then asked, “Eh? What should I call you then? Calling your name is strange as well.”</p> <p>Their conversation confused Qiu Lili as she looked at the two bewilderedly, asking, “Ahyayayay?”<br/>\n‘What are you talking about?’</p> <p>“Em, Junjun has remembered lots of things. I can’t explain everything to you now, but you’ll find out in the future,” Lin Qiao said to her.</p> <p>Turning back, she rested her chin on her hand and continued, “You can call me Captain from now on. I’m kinda leading a zombie squad after all.”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded in agreement, “That’s true…I’ll call you Captain then.”</p> <p>“Ahyayaya?” Qiu Lili looked at Lin Qiao and asked another question.<br/>\n‘Why are you the captain?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with a meaningful smile while saying, “Do you want to be the captain? You’ll be fixing all our problems…Is that okay?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Qiu Lili frowned and thought for a moment, then shook her head. She didn’t know much, and her skills were limited. For many problems, she didn’t know the solutions.</p> <p>She disappeared from time to time, so, Lin Qiao knew that she was too lazy to lead a team.</p> <p>“I’ll go ask Viney if it can heal another zombie. You wait here,” Lin Qiao as she entered the space. Standing by the lake, she shouted, “Viney, come out.”</p> <p>A few vines rose from the water surface in response, reaching toward her. She squatted by the water, reaching out a hand and letting the vines coil around it.</p> <p>“Viney, have you used up all your energy? Can you heal another one?”</p> <p>‘Em…That depends on if the healing requires a large amount of energy or not…Earlier on, the lady needed the energy in her head to be restored, as well as her memories, so it cost quite some energy…I don’t have lots of energy for healing right now…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, as she had guessed the same. “Alright! Will you be alright as you’ve consumed the energy up?” She asked.</p> <p>Viney’s few thick vines quickly wagged upon the water. ‘Lahlahlah…Viney is okay…Viney doesn’t need that energy…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao suddenly thought of something, so she asked, “Viney, how did you restore Junjun’s memory? Do you think that I’ve lost a part of my memory?”</p> <p>Once she asked the question, Viney gave the answer immediately.</p> <p>‘Yeah, yeah! Mama, you’ve lost some memories…Mama, don’t you know that? I can’t fix your memories…’</p> <p>“How do you know that?” Lin Qiao asked.</p> <p>‘Ah…I don’t know…But Mama, a part of your brain is wrapped by something…I can’t unlock it…’ Viney replied with confusion.</p> <p>A part of her brain was wrapped? By what? Was that the reason why she lost her memory of the past five years? She was using a different body now. Was this situation caused by her own body, or by Lu Tianyu’s body?</p> <p>“Will my memory be restored when that area in my brain is unlocked?” She asked.</p> <p>‘…I think so…But I’m not sure…Mama, you need to figure out a way and try…’ Viney nodded with the end of a vine, shaking its pair of small leaves.</p> <p>Lin Qiao supported her chin with one hand and said while thinking, “How should I try? Even you can’t restore my memory…”</p> <p>Viney seemed to be thinking about the same question, but it clearly didn’t have an answer.</p> <p>‘Em…em…em…Mama, maybe you should ask someone else…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed, with no choice except for agreeing, “Alright…Thank you, Viney!”</p> <p>‘Mama…Don’t say thank you to Viney…That sounds like we’re strangers…’ Viney complained unhappily.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and responded, “Alright, alright, that’s it! I’ll go out to ask the others if they can help.”</p> <p>‘Okay.’</p> <p>With that, Lin Qiao flashed out and returned to the room.</p> <p>“How is it?” Liu Jun immediately turned back and asked. Qiu Lili moved to Lin Qiao’s side as well, looking at her with anticipation.</p> <p>Lin Qiao said to Qiu Lili a little helplessly, “No, Viney says that the energy isn’t enough. We have to wait until next time, so be patient.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili pouted with disappointment and replied, “Ahya…”<br/>\n‘Alright.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao crooked her finger toward the two and said, “Here, Viney says that a part of my brain is wrapped by something. That might be the reason why I lost my memory. Think, is there a way to restore my memory?”</p> <p>Liu Jun looked at her with surprise and said, “Your head? Does it mean the head of Lu Tianyu? Or the head of yours in your soul?”</p> <p>“I’m not sure,” Lin Qiao shook her head confusedly.</p> <p>“And, your power…You used to have fire power, but why it became a mist?” Liu Jun continued.</p> <p>Speaking of her power, Lin Qiao was suddenly curious about her old power. She heard that she was able to release a poisonous black fire before.</p> <p>“Can you tell me about my old power?” She asked.</p> <p>Liu Jun put one arm before her chest, the other raised to support her chin. “Your old power was a black fire, which was why people call you Netherworld Fire. Your fire was able to melt…or devour things. Once you released your fire, everything within three meters would disappear. If you weren’t fighting against five level-sevens at one time, how could you possibly lose?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao imagined the fire that Liu Jun described, feeling that she had lost something.</p> <p>“You were powerful, don’t doubt that,” Liu Jun continued, “I think you might be able to find anything if you go to that place and take a look.”</p> <p>“What place,” Lin Qiao asked.</p> <p>“It’s…where you died,” said Liu Jun.</p> <p>Where she died? She didn’t even remember how she died! Her most recent memory was about that night before the apocalypse when she had a cold. But then, she figured out that Liu Jun was talking about the place where she was sieged by five level-sevens and died. Not many people knew about that place, so she still needed to find out where it was.</p> <p>She nodded and replied, “I was going to figure it out. Earlier, I had the same guess which wasn’t confirmed. But now, you’ve made my thoughts much clearer than before.”</p> <p>Junjun nodded in response.</p> <p>“Alright,” said Lin Qiao. “Although we don’t need sleep, but I think we should still get some rest. Tomorrow, I’ll talk to them about moving.”</p>",
  "Chapter 237: Recruit Zombie Members": "<p>Next Day, Lin Qiao brought Xie Dong to Lin Feng’s room. The door was open; in the room, Lin Feng was reading a book with Lin Xiaolu, who was sitting on his knees.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her hand to knock the door. The people in the room turned and saw a bald lady in camouflage suit standing by the door.</p> <p>“Ah, you’re here! Please come in.” in Feng put Lin Xiaolu down and pointed the other room as he said to her, “Xiaolu, go play with your aunty.”</p> <p>“Alright,” Lin Xiaolu nodded and replied before hopping toward the door. While getting close to Lin Qiao, she stared at the latter’s head. Lin Qiao smiled at her in response; after the little girl had left, she walked in with Xie Dong.</p> <p>Lin Feng pointed at the empty couch, then smiled at her and said, “Please sit down! It’s a surprise that you returned before Tianxing. I thought he’d be back earlier than you.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded as she sat down and responded, “I guess he’s still out there because he hasn’t found the people that he’s looking for.”</p> <p>Lin Feng puzzled at first, then stared at Lin Xiao with surprise and asked, “Eh? You can talk normally? If not because of your eyes, I wouldn’t believe that you’re a zombie. This is inconceivable.”</p> <p>After saying that, he stared at Lin Qiao again. ‘Isn’t this zombie evolving too rapidly? Which level is she at? Above level-six? But, her eyes are still black…No, her eyes are wearing a green color now!’ He said to himself.</p> <p>He suddenly discovered a pupil-sized green spot in the middle of each of Lin Qiao’s eyes as if she were wearing cosmetic contact lenses. The green spots were very light-colored, so he didn’t notice them before observing her eyes carefully.</p> <p>Lin Feng suspected that Lin Qiao was at above level-six because she seemed to have been playing the leading role among the group of zombies. Lin Feng believed that she was not weak. Besides, she wasn’t able to talk fluently before, but was now.</p> <p>This rate of improvement was way too amazing!</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave a faint smile and said, “I’m not an ordinary zombie…Alright, let’s talk about something serious.” While speaking, she took out a few maps from her space and spread them on the table. After that, she pointed at Upper City District, Lower City District, and West Lake District on the maps.</p> <p>“I found these maps from the Planning Bureau of Hang Zhou City,” she said, “I found that many supplies in these areas haven’t been collected. Upper City District and Lower City District had the biggest population back in the old world, so these two areas are now crowded by zombies. Moreover, both these areas seemed to have been sealed. So, I guess that not too many people managed to escape from these two areas when the apocalypse happened.”</p> <p>Lin Feng slightly lowered his head to look at the areas that Lin Qiao pointed at as she continued, “I’ve checked most of the bustling areas. Those places were full of zombies, but not many traces caused by fighting were found. If you want, we can make a zombie-free area for you, and will expand that area slowly in the future. West Lake District has many mutant plants, which I think can be put to use.”</p> <p>Lin Feng thought for a moment, then asked, “I have a question that I wanted to ask you before. You are able to gather zombies and build zombie walls, so the outsiders will need to pass the zombie wall before entering our place. But, have you ever thought about how our own people will exit? Even if you… eh, you zombies are willing to escort us, I think you’re a little shorthanded. I assume only you and the young girl in white dress are able to control ordinary zombies, right?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and responded, “Yes, her name is Qiu Lili. You all know that she’s a zombie queen. Apart from her, I can control ordinary zombies as well. Junjun has upgraded as well, so she can also do that now. But you’re right, we are shorthanded indeed! You reminded me of that. I need to recruit new zombie members.”</p> <p>In fact, Lin Qiao had thought about that question already, but didn’t tell Lin Feng. Now that he mentioned it, she decided to conveniently let him know about her plan.</p> <p>Earlier on, she had that idea when she saw the young female zombie who stole Wu Yueling in West Lake District. However, that young zombie looked a little wild and weird. Therefore, to bring her into the group, Lin Qiao needed to figure out what she was thinking.</p> <p>To serve that purpose, she asked Qiu Lili to make contact with that snake-eyed young female zombie.</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at her with doubts as he said, “The ones you want to recruit aren’t all zombie kings and queens, are they? Are you sure?” Somehow, he felt that zombie kings and queens were not dangerous at all in Lin Qiao’s eyes. Well, they were not threatening to her indeed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave a faint smile and replied, “Don’t worry, I’ll put them under control. As long as I’m here, they won’t hurt any human.” She wouldn’t let any zombie or human hurt Lin Feng and his family.</p> <p>Lin Feng wasn’t in favor of Lin Qiao’s idea, yet he understood that he had no right to interfere with her. “Alright then,” he said, “You have the right to make decisions for your team. But, I hope that you can make sure of the safe distance between your team and mine. If any of your zombies hurt our people, it would be bad for both of us.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and responded, “Don’t worry! Any zombie who loses control and attempts to eat human beings, I’ll destroy it first.”</p> <p>Lin Feng thought for a moment, then added, “I suggest to not let other people know about your plan when you carry it out.”</p> <p>“Thank you!” Lin Qiao smiled faintly.</p> <p>Lin Feng pointed at the Upper City District while saying, “We’re going to the Upper City District then. But, we have to wait until Yuan Tianxing and the others have returned. Later on, we’ll be needing a lot of people, including technicists. None of us know how to install this solar equipment. We can only make sure that it won’t break during the disassembling.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao rubbed her own chin as she said, “Yuan Tianxing should have thought about that. Other than the few people that he’s looking for, I think he might also bring some others.”</p> <p>Lin Feng paused slightly, then spent a moment thinking. Indeed, Yuan Tianxing would think about those things. “How do you know that he’ll think about it? We haven’t discussed it before,” Lin Feng asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him and said, “Isn’t he one of the Deputy Chiefs of the Hades Base? How did he make it to that position if he can’t even think of these questions?”</p> <p>Lin Feng couldn’t think of anything to say.</p> <p>They roughly selected a few potential locations for the new base, after which, Lin Qiao made reports about some other areas. Then, they decided to wait until Yuan Tianxing came back before making the final decision.</p> <p>At that point, Yuan Tianxing and the others, who were in Sea City Base, were a little frustrated, because they had learned that Li Zheng and his teammates were no longer in the base. They had gone out with an armed squad to carry out some kind of mission.</p> <p>Li Zheng and his whole team went out, none of them staying in the base. Yuan Tianxing just couldn’t figure out what they were doing.</p> <p>But soon, he made other decisions. Since Li Zheng and his people weren’t in the base, he decided to return with the others first. Furthermore, he needed to find some technicists.</p>",
  "Chapter 238: Have Meal Together": "<p>The one who welcomed Yuan Tianxing was a Deputy Chief of Sea City Base, who was also the only female among all Deputy Chiefs.</p> <p>“If you want to find these people, you can create a mission in the Mission Hall. As long as you pay, I believe some people will be willing to go,” Yan Fangyu sat on the couch as she looked at Yuan Tianxing and gave him a suggestion.</p> <p>She was a pretty woman, looking around twenty-five or twenty-six years old. But in fact, she was twenty-nine already. She was the only woman in the base who was at the peak of level-six, and was about to step into level-seven.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing was here to find Wu Chengyue, but as the latter wasn’t in the base, he met Zou Shizou instead. Zou Shizou was a busy man, so after the first polite meeting, he asked Yan Fangyu to help Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>They wouldn’t lend their army to Yuan Tianxing, but as long as he paid enough, quite some people with skills would be willing to work for him.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing smiled and responded, “Thank you for providing me with a platform for hiring!”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu smiled elegantly, then said half-jokingly, “Even though you’re handsome, we won’t help you for free because of that. We charge for our work too.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing responded carelessly, “Ah, I understand! I brought some, just don’t know if it’s enough.” While speaking, he asked Du Yuanxing, who stood behind him, to take out a little cloth bag which was designed to contain jewelry. Then, he opened the bag and poured what was inside it on the table.</p> <p>Clang! Three zombie nuclei fell on the table.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu recognized them as three level-five zombie nuclei. That was a little too much, so she hurriedly waved a hand and said, “Ahyaya, this is too much! We didn’t do you much of a help, did we? As this is our first cooperation, I’ll give you a discount.” While speaking, she stood up and walked to Yuan Tianxing, then bent her slim waist. A refreshing aroma invaded his nose immediately.</p> <p>She picked one zombie nucleus, then straightened up and turned her head to smile at Yuan Tianxing. Afterward, she went back to her seat.</p> <p>“One is enough. Normally, we’ll charge one level-five zombie nucleus and five level-four, not as much as you offered. Today, I’ll only charge you one level-five, for your sake.”</p> <p>‘For my sake?’ Yuan Tianxing continued smiling while looking at her. However, the look in his eyes turned meaningful.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu sat down and crossed her long and slender legs as she smiled at him and asked, “What? Don’t you trust me?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and responded, “I surely believe that Miss. Yan won’t lie to me.”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu looked at him straight in the eyes, then said, “Alright then, give me a list of the technicists you need, then I’ll publish it for you. You can put up the reward amount, or you can negotiate it with them later.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and replied, “Sure, I’ll have my people send the list to you tomorrow. Thank you for helping us!”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu grinned, gazing at him in a meaningful way while saying, “You’re welcome! If you really want to thank me, how about joining me for dinner? I wonder if Mr. Yuan will be willing to have a meal together with me.”</p> <p>‘Here it goes!’</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing felt a little embarrassed, but still, he maintained a polite smile while responding, “Of course I am! It’s my pleasure to have dinner with such a beautiful lady.”</p> <p>Standing behind Yuan Tianxing, Du Yuanxing wore no expression on his face, though he had already burst into screams internally.</p> <p>‘Wow! Deputy Chief! You do have some fortune in love affairs! As I thought, you’re able to make a living with your appearance!’</p> <p>‘Why can’t I be so lucky? Ah, I’m so jealous, so jealous.’</p> <p>Afterward, the two Deputy Chiefs went to the canteen together for dinner. Soon, Yuan Tianxing received lots of gazes containing strong hostility. Many people stared at him enviously. Most of them didn’t know who he was, so they just threatened him with their eyes.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing smiled at Yan Fangyu and said to her, “Miss. Yan, you’re really popular! I guess if your suitors in the base lined up, the line would even extend outside the base.”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu, who was sitting in front of him and eating with an elegant manner, turned to coldly glance at the surrounding people. Instantly, those people turned their eyes away from Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>After that, she turned back and gave Yuan Tianxing a faint smile, then responded, “They just want all pretty women for themselves. I just can’t understand why you men are all so possessive. When you can’t have something that you want, you’ll tend to use violence. Moreover, these people just like my appearance.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, she picked up the goblet and took a sip of the wine as Yuan Tianxing looked at her with surprise. He didn’t think that this woman could be so frank off work.</p> <p>She was right; those men looked at her with their eyes filled with desire, with no other feelings at all.</p> <p>He had been in Sea City Base for a few days, and had learned quite a lot about this base. Regarding pretty women, two of them were the most famous among everyone, and one of them was Yan Fangyu.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu managed to become a Deputy Chief, which meant she did have some capabilities. She was efficient and capable, and was at a high power level. Besides, she had a strong vibe. She was beautiful indeed, but men could only appreciate her from a safe distance away; because if they attempted to approach her, they might get burned.</p> <p>Another famous pretty woman in this base was notorious. She was beautiful too, but was only an ordinary person. She didn’t have any power, neither was she willing to work. She would get tired in just a couple of days and quit even during simple jobs.</p> <p>She was not only lazy, but also a bully and trouble maker. She bullied others recklessly only because she was the mistress of a base leader.</p> <p>People weren’t afraid of her, but were afraid of the base leader who was protecting her. Therefore, they never dared to voice out their discontentment when she bullied them.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing forgot to ask people about that evil woman’s name. He had heard that she caused people trouble almost every day, so after she died, people even applauded for her death.</p> <p>After politely finishing the relatively luxurious meal with Yan Fangyu, Yuan Tianxing returned to his room, where he asked Du Yuanxing about the evil woman’s name.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing answered his question with a weird look, “Ah, that woman…I heard that her name was Lu Tianyu…”</p> <p>Hearing that name, Yuan Tianxing was puzzled at first. Three seconds later, he paused, then turned to Du Yuanxing and asked with confusion, “What? What’s her name?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing coughed slightly and said with laughter, “You’re right, her name is Lu Tianyu!”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at Du Yuanxing and responded with a weird look, “What a coincidence! We recently met a zombie whose name is Lu Tianyu as well…”</p>",
  "Chapter 239: Li Zheng And His People Are Caught": "<p>The two of them glanced at each other, then Yuan Tianxing said, “They aren’t the same Lu Tianyu, are they?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing looked at him embarrassedly and responded, “Eh…I think, I’m not sure.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing crossed his arms before his chest and murmured, “But I heard that Lu Tianyu was thrown into a zombie crowd. She should either be dead or turned into a zombie.”</p> <p>“Eh…isn’t the Lu Tianyu we know a zombie?” Said Du Yuanxing, “And she’s from Sea City too.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and said, “We can’t conclude that she’s her only because they have the same name. Besides, I heard that the Lu Tianyu in Sea City Base was an evil woman. As for the one we know, I can’t see through her.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing shrugged, as he didn’t know more than Yuan Tianxing did.</p> <p>At night, Yuan Tianxing made a long list of the technicists he needed, as well as the requirements and rewards. Next day, he asked Du Yuanxing to send the list to Yan Fangyu.</p> <p>In the afternoon, a man found Yuan Tianxing in a hurry. The latter thought that the man came for a job interview, but as he looked at him closely, he recognized that man as a friend; also someone he was looking for.</p> <p>“Lin Yu? Why are you alone? What happened to you? Where’re the others?”</p> <p>Lin Yu’s whole body was covered in dust and wounds. His face was pale, his eyes showing anxiousness. Yuan Tianxing looked at him with surprise and asked the above questions.</p> <p>“De-Deputy Chief…” Lin Yu bent over as he put a hand on the doorframe to support his body and sighed with relief. Right after calling Yuan Tianxing, he softly fell to the ground.</p> <p>“Eh!” Yuan Tianxing and Du Yuanxing hurriedly held him up and brought him into the room.</p> <p>It was already dark by the time Lin Yu woke up. He sat up from the bed and turned to look at Yuan Tianxing, who was sitting on a couch and reading a book.</p> <p>“Deputy Chief!”</p> <p>Hearing him, Yuan Tianxing immediately looked at him and said, “You’re awake!” Then, he stood up, picked up a glass of water from the table before him, and handed it to Lin Yu while speaking, “Drink some water first…Take your time if you need to tell me something.”</p> <p>Lin Yu took over the glass and emptied it.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing took the empty glass and put it on the table, then grabbed a chair to sit down. After that, he looked at Lin Yu and started asking questions.</p> <p>“Tell me, what happened?”</p> <p>Lin Yu looked at Yuan Tianxing and said with emotion, “I didn’t know that you’d be in Sea City Base. We…We heard about what happened in our base, and we didn’t want to believe it. Now, since you’re here, I guess that’s real. Great Captain and the others…”</p> <p>As Lin Yu was talking a little incoherently, Yuan Tianxing waved a hand at him and said, “Calm down first…Listen to my question, then answer it.”</p> <p>Seeing his gesture, Lin Yu forced himself to calm down, then nodded at him.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at him and asked, “Let me tell you about our situation first. You may have heard what happened in our base. In fact, all the other bases have known about it by now. Our base is gone, and our leader…We don’t know if she’s alive or dead yet. We heard that she blew herself up, but I didn’t see it with my own eyes, so I don’t believe it.”</p> <p>Lin Yu wore a lifeless expression. He had prepared himself for this since long ago, but after hearing his Deputy Chief confirm it, he still couldn’t accept it.</p> <p>“How can it be…How can it be…!”</p> <p>“Calm down!” Yuan Tianxing comforted him, “Except for Chief, Lin Feng and his family are all fine. They’ve made it to Sea City as well. You see, I’m here to find technicists.”</p> <p>“So what Yang Jianhua said is real?” Lin Yu suddenly asked a question, then raised his head to look at Yuan Tianxing, who was smiling. But on hearing Lin Yu’s words, the smile on his face faded gradually.</p> <p>“You met Yang Jianhua?” With a dark face and a frown, he asked. Lin Yu nodded, then said angrily, “Deputy Chief, didn’t you ask me why I am alone? All the others were caught by him two days ago.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing puzzled at first, then asked in shock, “They were caught? What were you doing when you met him?”</p> <p>“It’s because Chief Purple Thunder from Sea City Base, also known as Chief Wu, received a message from our base and learned about what happened to Great Captain and his people, so he decided to send out a team to help them. We found out about it, so we joined the team, even though we didn’t want to believe it.”</p> <p>“You mean Chief Wu has sent people to help Lin Feng? But, we didn’t see anyone come to our aid.” Yuan Tianxing said with surprise.</p> <p>Lin Yu nodded and said, “He did send out a team, and our squad followed them out as well. However, we didn’t figure out which path and direction Great Captain was taking. We searched for a few days, but failed to find even a trace of Great Captain and his people. At last, we ran into Yang Jianhua.”</p> <p>“So you know what Yang Jianhua did?” Asked Yuan Tianxing calmly.</p> <p>“We don’t need to. He didn’t see anything when he saw us, but directly attacked. The others were either killed or captured by him,” said Lin Yu with a dark face. Hearing that, Yuan Tianxing bent over and put his elbows on his knees; his hands crossed, and his head rested on the back of his hands.</p> <p>“So how did you make it back alone? Did you escape? Or, did he let you go on purpose?”</p> <p>“I escaped!” said Lin Yu, “I wasn’t there, so Yang Jianhua didn’t see me, and only caught the others. I was hiding aside and watching, so he didn’t find me.”</p> <p>“You’re really lucky,” Yuan Tianxing looked at him and said, “So, you came back alone?”</p> <p>Lin Yu nodded and said, “After defeating the others, Yang Jianhua said something in front of them. I heard what he said.”</p> <p>“What did he say?” Yuan Tianxing gave an icy-cold smile and asked. Seeing that smile, Lin Yu felt that his hair were standing on their ends. “Eh, he said that the Hades Base belongs to him now, and that he’s the Chief. He said that the ones who are willing to follow him will be able to return to the Hades Base, and that Lin Wenwen will become his, both her body and her heart. After that, he laughed wildly.”</p> <p>“Hehe, he’s really ambitious…” said Yuan Tianxing with that cold smile, “…and shameless!”</p> <p>“Why did he…betray our Chief?” Lin Yu asked confusedly.</p> <p>“Who knows?” Yuan Tianxing responded, “But, don’t worry about Lin Feng and the others. They’re all fine now.”</p> <p>“I was all alone, so I didn’t know what to do,” said Lin Yu, “I couldn’t defeat him or save them, so I came back. Unexpectedly, when I got back, I heard that you’re here to find us.”</p> <p>“Thankfully, you’re back! Otherwise, my trip here would be meaningless,” Yuan Tianxing said.</p>",
  "Chapter 240: Start From The Followers": "<p>“Deputy Chief,” asked Lin Yu, “why did you come to Sea City Base to find us?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “Em, we’re now staying in a town at the edge of Hangzhou City. We’re planning to build a new base.”</p> <p>Lin Yu paused slightly, then popped his eyes as he stared at Yuan Tianxing and asked with surprise, “Build…build a new base? Who?”</p> <p>“Us,” said Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>“How many people…do we have then?” Lin Yu asked. Yuan Tianxing spent a moment counting, then answered his question, “Around ten…I came to Sea City Base to ask for help. Perhaps, we can hire some people from here.”</p> <p>Lin Yu looked at him, stunned.</p> <p>How could ten people build a base? And where?</p> <p>On the other side, after Lin Qiao and Lin Feng had both agreed to wait for Yuan Tianxing to return before making the final decision, she began preparing to fix Qiu Lili and Xie Dong’s body.</p> <p>The energy wasn’t enough, so Lin Qiao asked Qiu Lili to find more zombie nuclei. Then, she suddenly had her eyes on Qiu Lili’s two underlings.</p> <p>“Lili, shall we upgrade these two as well?”</p> <p>“Ahya?” Qiu Lili looked at the two zombies confusedly.<br/>\n‘Them?’</p> <p>Qiu Lili had ordered the two to stay outside at a long distance away without approaching the hotel, because they had no humanity. They acted harmlessly to human beings because they were under Qiu Lili’s control. Although they were both smart, their beast-like instincts were strong.</p> <p>Without Qiu Lili, they might still attack the group of humans because of hunger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao said, “We now need a zombie squad to protect Lin Feng and his people, and to improve our strength. After all, our next target is a zombie city which is full of zombies. We might get too busy if we don’t recruit new members. Besides, more and more people will be live in the base, so we need to escort them in and out more frequently. By that time, the ordinary zombies surrounding the base will need to be controlled by higher level zombies.”</p> <p>Hearing her, Qiu Lili nodded knowingly.</p> <p>Liu Jun carried Tong Tong and joined the conversation, “We should first resolve their hunger. I think you can do that by giving them the water from your lake.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Em, I have the same plan.” She surely knew that the energy in her lake was able to slowly erase the hunger of zombies. Judging by the changes that had happened to Liu Jun, she wondered if the other zombies would regain some memories after being treated by Viney in the lake.</p> <p>She wanted to run a test and see if the lake water could restore zombies’ memories.</p> <p>“Let’s go out and try the two,” Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili walked downstairs to the parking lot. The few mutant turtles were still sleeping in the giant cage.</p> <p>Liu Jun didn’t follow them. Her room was facing the other side, so she wasn’t able to see Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili through the window.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili coming to the parking lot, Lin Xiaolu who was upstairs, looked at them by the window with curiosity. Then, she called her mother and aunty and told them to look at the two zombies.</p> <p>“Mom, Aunty, look! What are they playing down there?”</p> <p>“Who are they?” Lin Wenwen and Cheng Wangxue looked at her and asked.</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu pointed down through the window while turning back to respond, “That bald lady, and the lady who likes white dresses.”</p> <p>“Lu Tianyu and Qiu Lili?” Said Lin Wenwen, “What are they doing?” While speaking, she walked toward the window curiously.</p> <p>“Eh, it’s really them! What are they doing?”</p> <p>“I heard that Lu Tianyu is going to expand her zombie squad. I guess she’s preparing to start,” said Cheng Wangxue.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen turned to look at her with surprise, then asked, “Zombie squad? What zombie squad?”</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue shook her head.</p> <p>Down the building, Lin Qiao said to Qiu Lili, “Lili, you go hunt three level-five zombies and collect their nuclei. I think that’ll be enough for you. And then, summon your…eh, your followers. I’ll get them into the space and fix them.”</p> <p>As this was about her recovery and talking ability, Qiu Lili immediately did what Lin Qiao said. She nodded, then turned and screamed toward the outside.<br/>\n“Ah!”</p> <p>Hearing her shrill voice, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but have her eyebrows twitch slightly.</p> <p>About ten seconds later, two figures darted over on all fours from a long distance away, then squatted before Qiu Lili quietly. One male and one female, the two zombies squatted in front of Qiu Lili. Looking at them, Lin Qiao suddenly felt that they looked like two large dogs.</p> <p>The two level-four zombies squatted before Qiu Lili, then raised their heads to look at the latter with fear. Qiu Lili raised a hand, then pointed at Lin Qiao and said, “Ahyayayay…”</p> <p>‘Now you have to listen to her, or she’ll eat you!’ She said to the two zombies.</p> <p>‘I don’t eat zombies…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently glanced at Qiu Lili, then took off her sunglasses and turned to look at the two zombies with a serious look. A cold beam of light flashed across her pair of dark eyes which glowed with a faint green light.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>The two level-four zombies immediately felt threatened. Their hair stood straight up as they uttered deep and warning growls toward Lin Qiao.<br/>\nSeeing their reaction, Qiu Lili immediately screamed at them, “Ahyaya!”<br/>\n‘Quiet! She won’t eat you if you follow her orders!’</p> <p>“Whoo….” The two level-four zombies were so afraid of Qiu Lili that once they heard her screams, they quieted down. Lin Qiao walked to them and said, “Reach out your claws.”</p> <p>“Roar!” The two zombies maintained a high vigilance against her. They didn’t move, but stared at her and uttered strange growls from their throats. Lin Qiao had no choice but to release her vibe fully, then narrowed her eyes and looked at the two zombies.</p> <p>“Whooo…” Once Lin Qiao released her vibe, the two level-four zombies who were highly alert against her immediately dropped their heads and hunched their backs.</p> <p>“Claws,” said Lin Qiao. This time, the two zombies finally reached out their claws obediently. Seeing their dirty claws, Lin Qiao couldn’t tell if they had eaten any human beings. However, she felt that no other human beings existed in this area except Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>The two zombies didn’t look energetic at all, so Lin Qiao guessed that they hadn’t fed in a long time.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pinched a small corner of each of their sleeves which looked relatively cleaner, then disappeared with them. After that, Qiu Lili turned and hopped onto the roof, standing on the highest spot of the building.<br/>\nShe closed her eyes to sense around, then flashed toward one direction and disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>Upstairs, Lin Wenwen said, “What are they doing? Lu Tianyu seemed to have brought the two level-four zombies into her space. What is she up to?”</p> <p>“Who knows?” Said Cheng Wangxue.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen rested her chin on her hand and continued, “I think the two she brought into her space are ordinary zombies, not like herself and her friends. The two are like those zombies which have lost their mind, and will bite any human they see, right?”</p>",
  "Chapter 241: Give The Zombies A Bath": "<p>In the space, the two zombies were immediately agitated by the sudden change of the surrounding environment. They leaped toward a clearing, then leaned against each other as they stared at Lin Qiao while observing the surrounding area.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them and felt like laughing. “Come here,” she said to the two zombies.</p> <p>“Roar!” Her words were barely effective on the two zombies, who only listened to Qiu Lili. The two zombies remained unmoved while giving her warning growls.</p> <p>‘They’re not following my orders…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly looked at the two zombies whose faces were barely recognizable. Suddenly, her eyes turned cold as she bared her sharp teeth toward them.</p> <p>“Whoo…” seeing that, the two level-four zombies immediately quieted down. Lin Qiao stopped baring her teeth and said to them, “Come over, stand here.” While speaking, she pointed at the clearing next to her.</p> <p>The two zombies moved toward that area while rubbing against each other like two large dogs. Lin Qiao sniffed at them, then found that these two dirty zombies weren’t stinky. No blood scent was detected from them at all, probably because they hadn’t eaten human beings in a long while, or Qiu Lili never let them.</p> <p>They looked dirty, but not smelly. Lin Qiao guessed that was why Qiu Lili let them follow her.</p> <p>As the two zombies obediently moved over and squatted in the area that she pointed at, Lin Qiao turned and took two large buckets which were over one-meter tall to the lakeside, and filled them with the lake water. As the two buckets were filled, she dragged them to the side.</p> <p>At that moment, a few thick vines rose from the lake, wriggling toward her.</p> <p>After filling the buckets, Lin Qiao waved her hand toward the two zombies and said, “Come here.”</p> <p>The two zombies didn’t move, but looked at her nervously.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed, then bared her teeth toward them and repeated with a dry voice, “I said come here!”<br/>\n“Roar!”</p> <p>Since the two zombies couldn’t understand human words, she decided to use zombie language.</p> <p>“Roar!” The two zombies were immediately frightened. Lin Qiao seemed to be at the same level as they were, but somehow, her vibe was extremely strong. The pressure that she had been giving the two zombies was way too intense.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had nearly lost her patience. Abruptly, she flashed around the two zombies, then returned to the side of the two buckets.</p> <p>As she looked at the two zombies again, their clothes had already fallen onto the ground in pieces, lying around their feet.</p> <p>“Roar!” The two zombies made no reaction to their shredded clothes, but were very unhappy because of Lin Qiao’s sudden approach.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rested her head on her hand and looking at the two naked zombies. Their muscles were dry and skin was wrinkled. Then, she turned to look at the two buckets.</p> <p>Was it possible for the two zombies to bring themselves into the buckets?</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head. Should she put them into the buckets and bathe them?</p> <p>At that moment, she felt something climbing onto her feet. She lowered her head to find that it was Viney.</p> <p>‘Mama, can I eat them? Even though they don’t have lots of energy…’ Viney’s voice was heard inside Lin Qiao’s head. She shook her head and said, “No, Viney, you can’t eat them. Can you help me put them into the buckets? They won’t follow my orders.”</p> <p>‘Put them into the buckets? Why?’ Viney asked.</p> <p>“Because I need to bathe them,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Viney didn’t quite understand Lin Qiao’s request, but it was still happy to help.</p> <p>‘Alright, I’ll do it then!’</p> <p>While speaking, she threw two vines toward the two naked zombies. Before they could react, they were wrapped up and lifted.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>“Roarrrrah…”</p> <p>The two zombies realized what was happening after they were tied up. They struggled as hard as they could while howling in a panic. In the next second, they were thrown into the buckets and forced to squat.</p> <p>Following a series of water clattering noise, the water gushed out of the buckets.</p> <p>“Stop moving, sit tight,” Lin Qiao stood beside, looking at the two. While speaking, she was thinking about how to make these two zombies follow her orders. However, she didn’t notice that the faint green light in her eyes suddenly grew deeper as she stared at the two zombies.</p> <p>Under the gaze of her green eyes, the two zombies suddenly quieted down. They sat in the buckets like two dogs, looking straight at Lin Qiao with their dark eyes.</p> <p>“En? Are you willing to follow my words now?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them with surprise. She didn’t seem to be able to control the zombies above level-four, so she didn’t plan to control the two level-four zombies. But to her surprise, these two suddenly followed her words. It seemed that she had them controlled.</p> <p>Was it the effect of her last treatment?</p> <p>Lin Qiao got close to the two zombies and looked around, then said to the male zombie, “Raise your hands.”</p> <p>As she expected, the male zombie obediently reached both hands forward, then looked at Lin Qiao with confusion. She couldn’t sense its thoughts, so she didn’t know if the male zombie under her control had entered a resting state, just like hypnosis.</p> <p>“Bend your arms and get some water to wash your face with your palms,” she continued to the male zombie. She wasn’t sure if it could understand her completely.</p> <p>Before she finished thinking, the male zombie bent both arms and sank its palms into the water. Then, it scooped some water with its palms and poured onto its face.</p> <p>After that, the male zombie repeated the same move.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up, turned to say to the female zombie, “Do what he did.” Once she said that, the female zombie turned and glanced at the male zombie, then scooped some water to wash her face. Unlike the male zombie, she would also wipe her face with her palms.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with surprise.</p> <p>‘Eh, this female zombie has a better understanding of my words than the male.’</p> <p>Viney grabbed Lin Qiao’s wrist with another vine and asked her, ‘Mama, why do you want to bathe them? Do you want them to be clean so I can eat them?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao explained to Viney, “They aren’t for you to eat. I want to turn and train them, so they can work for me.”</p> <p>Viney responded without fully understanding, ‘Ah…I see! Why do you want them to bathe?’</p> <p>“Because I need to remold their bodies first with the energy in the lake. After that, I’ll train their minds. In the future, I might also need you to fix them, to see if we can restore some of their memories.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Viney nodded knowingly, ‘Ah, sure, sure…But I don’t have much of energy…Aren’t we going to fix Lili, the zombie in white dress?’</p> <p>“I know, be patient! We’ll get you enough energy,” said Lin Qiao smilingly.</p> <p>‘Okay,’ Viney responded.</p>",
  "Chapter 242: Stop Drinking": "<p>“Call Lili Sister. Don’t call her zombie,” said Lin Qiao to Viney.</p> <p>‘Okay,’ Viney responded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood beside the two buckets, narrowed her eyes to look at the energy in the water. After quite a while, she finally discovered that the energy was seeping into the bodies of the two zombies at a very slow speed.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then turned and found a cup. She walked to the lake and filled the cup with water, then came back to the female zombie, who was still washing her face.</p> <p>“Alright, alright, you may stop,” said Lin Qiao to the female zombie who had already cleaned her face. As most of the dirt on the female zombie’s face had been washed off, the scars on her face looked more obvious than before. Some skin and flesh on her forehead was missing, with the bone in that area exposed. Her eyes were sunk deeply, and the dark circles under her eyes were as dark as that of a panda.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave the zombie a closer look and found that her face was rather delicate, and she looked quite young.</p> <p>Lin Qiao held her chin, pinched her cheeks, and opened her mouth.</p> <p>“Roar!” The female zombie uttered a deep and muffled roar, but still obediently opened her mouth. An awful smell was released from her mouth as her sharp teeth were bared.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned her head slightly. As the smell from her mouth faded a little, Lin Qiao poured the cup of water into her mouth.</p> <p>“Gu…ro…Aw…Go…ro…” At first, the female zombie didn’t want to swallow the water and let out weird sound from her throat. However, Lin Qiao forced her to drink the whole cup of water.</p> <p>As she prepared to fetch the second cup of water, she suddenly detected some difference in the female zombie.</p> <p>“Whooo…Roar…”<br/>\n‘I want more…I want more…’</p> <p>She was only repeating the three words, but it still surprised Lin Qiao.</p> <p>‘Does she want more of the water? The zombie actually wants to drink the lake water? Why didn’t Qiu Lili and Junjun want to drink it?’ Lin Qiao wondered. She narrowed her eyes and saw the thick green energy rolling in the bucket.</p> <p>Was it because of the energy? This time, Viney seemed to have grown much stronger, and the energy in the lake had risen by many times.</p> <p>“Roarrr…” As Lin Qiao made no move, the female zombie got a little anxious and roared at her. Lin Qiao looked at her speechlessly; the bone-deep wound on her head was especially obvious.</p> <p>‘You’re getting impatient. You’re not like the kids who can’t get the candy they want…Well, alright, the IQ of level three and four zombies is indeed like that of human children,’</p> <p>Lin Qiao relaxed her grip, then turned to fetch more water from the lake. When she came back, she saw that the female zombie drinking the water in the bucket.</p> <p>“Oi, don’t drink that! If you drink this, how are you gonna bathe?” Lin Qiao hurriedly lifted the zombie’s face. While pouring the water in the cup into her mouth, she continued, “Drinking excessively won’t help you. You’ll drink only two cups for today. Tomorrow, when you have absorbed all the energy, you’ll drink more. You’re not allowed to drink from the bucket.”</p> <p>‘This is your bathing water. Do you know how dirty you are?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the female zombie, wondering if she would wake up one day and remember this…</p> <p>As the zombie drank the second cup of water, Lin Qiao said to her, “Alright, no more for today! It will be a waste for you to drink more.” After that, she turned to refill the cup and made the male zombie drink two cups as well. The male zombie also looked young, seeming to have been in his twenties.</p> <p>He reacted much slower than the female zombie. After drinking the first cup of water, he didn’t ask for more.</p> <p>After pouring the second cup of water into the male zombie’s mouth, Lin Qiao turned her head to find the female zombie drinking the bath water again.</p> <p>Somehow, it reminded Lin Qiao of the time when she bathed in the lake, and felt a little disgusted.</p> <p>“You’re drinking again! Stop drinking!” Even though she felt a little disgusted, she yelled at the female zombie who was still drinking.</p> <p>“Roar…” The female zombie stopped. She was unhappy, but she didn’t lower her head to drink from the bucket again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took a circle around the two zombies, then reached out a hand to pinch their muscles. Their muscles were hard, but weirdly elastic, like hard rubber. Then, she turned and said to Viney, “Viney, keep an eye on them. Don’t let them run out.”</p> <p>Viney waved a few vines in the water to let her know that it had received the order.</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao turned and left the space. As she turned around, she saw the giant cage again. Earlier on, she had asked Long Qingying to make this cage for keeping those large turtles. By this time, there were still a few turtles in it.</p> <p>She had told Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying that they could all eat these turtles, but no one believed her.</p> <p>Seeing these turtles, Lin Qiao realized that she hadn’t eaten anything for days. So, she squatted by the cage, looking at the few turtles which had piled up in the cage.</p> <p>At that point, Liu Jun walked out of the hotel, with Tong Tong carried in her arms.</p> <p>“You’re not hungry, are you?” Seeing Lin Qiao squatting by the cage, Liu Jun chuckled and asked.</p> <p>“A little…” Lin Qiao nodded and said.</p> <p>“How long has it been since you ate last time? It has not even been a week,” said Liu Jun.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to look at her and said, “Aren’t you hungry? Before I saw them, I didn’t really feel like eating. But they’re useless here, so I decided to boil them and eat them.”</p> <p>“Boil?” Liu Jun looked at her with surprise, saying, “You eat cooked food now?”</p> <p>“The cooked turtle will be for him,” Lin Qiao pointed at Tong Tong and said, “Turtle soup is nourishing.”</p> <p>“Ah!” Liu Jun looked at her son, then responded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her, then turned back to lift the cage and got inside.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>She put down the cage and walked toward those large turtles. Afterward, she picked up a turtle, then disappeared from the cage.</p> <p>Liu Jun thought that she was going to cook the turtle in her space, but unexpectedly, she showed up in the next moment and got out of the cage. Lin Qiao walked toward Junjun while saying, “Let’s get back to our room first. I need to find some salt from the kitchen.”</p> <p>Earlier on, Du Yuanxing and the others had found some well-preserved refined salt. The shelf life of this batch of salt was five years, so even though five years had passed since the apocalypse, the salt hadn’t expired for long.</p> <p>In this era, safe salt was precious. As for the expiration date, that wasn’t important.</p> <p>“Alright,” Liu Jun nodded, then followed Lin Qiao to the hotel.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found the kitchen of the restaurant in the hotel. As the solar power was back, some kitchen equipment was functional. Therefore, Lin Feng and his people would cook in the kitchen, then bring the food upstairs to eat, or eat in the restaurant.</p> <p>Thanks to Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili, no zombie dared to come into the hotel. Even the area hundreds of meters around the hotel was zombie-free. Therefore, Lin Feng and his people had gradually relaxed their vigilance and begun doing things freely in the hotel.</p>",
  "Chapter 243: Make Turtle Soup": "<p>Lin Qiao found some salt from the kitchen and put it in a jar. Then, she entered her space, looking at the turtle which was lying on its back by the lakeside.</p> <p>She squatted beside the turtle and turned it around. She planned to cut off its head first. However, the turtle wouldn’t stick its head out. So, without a choice, Lin Qiao decided to cut it into pieces directly.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao lifted it, the quiet turtle seemed to suddenly sense danger, abruptly sticking out its head and limbs to struggle.</p> <p>Lin Qiao grasped the opportunity and cut it with her claws, causing the turtle head to fall onto the ground. Afterward, she cut through the thin shell on the side of the turtle’s body and pressed her fingers on the line.</p> <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Following the series of noise, the turtle shell was broken. Lin Qiao clasped the turtle shell with one hand and tore it with the other, easily splitting the turtle into two.</p> <p>The fishy aroma instantly grew stronger. Maybe because the turtle hadn’t touched water for a few days, Lin Qiao somehow felt that the fishy smell was lighter than before.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sliced off a piece of turtle meat with her fingernail, then put it into her mouth. It was smooth and soft, tasting sweet and fishy, not the same as before. Before, she didn’t taste such a strong flavor of the turtle.</p> <p>Finishing the first slice, she cut off another slice and put it into her mouth. After that, she couldn’t stop eating. Only until half of the turtle was eaten by her did she remember that she still needed to make turtle soup for Tong Tong.</p> <p>She hurriedly washed the rest of the turtle. As she didn’t have other seasoning, she decided to boil the turtle together with potatoes, then add some vegetables to enrich the flavor.</p> <p>Except for Tong Tong, she also wanted Lin Xiaolu to have some of the turtle meat. Then, she thought of Lin Xiaolu’s parents, aunty, uncle, grandparents, Long Qingying and the others.</p> <p>‘Alright, those adults can have some soup,’ she thought.</p> <p>As she was now cooking for more people, she decided to add some vegetables. So, she washed some cabbages and put them into the soup. Soon, a large potful of soup was ready.</p> <p>At last, she carried a large potful of turtle soup out of her space.</p> <p>Boiled food was flavorless for Lin Qiao. However, Tong Tong seemed to have detected something. Once she walked into the room with the pot, he twitched her nose and began sniffing around.</p> <p>“Mom…It smells nice…” He fixed his eyes on the pot in Lin Qiao’s hands and then dragged Liu Jun’s trousers. Liu Jun had sensed Lin Qiao when the latter walked in, but like her, she didn’t smell anything either. Hearing her son, she turned to look at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Then, she saw Lin Qiao walk in with a large pot of steaming soup.</p> <p>“The soup is ready? So much?”</p> <p>“You go find a large bowl to get some soup for Tong Tong, then I’ll bring the rest to the others. Xiaolu has lost some weight, so I want her to absorb some nourishment.”</p> <p>Liu Jun smilingly nodded, then gently pulled Tong Tong away from her leg and said, “Good Tong Tong, sit here. Mommy will get you some delicious soup.”</p> <p>Hearing that he could have some delicious soup, Tong Tong quietly sat on the couch. Liu Jun then stood up and walked to the cabinet nearby, taking a large stainless steel bowl and a small one. After that, she filled the large bowl with soup, meat, and vegetables.</p> <p>“Alright, these are enough for Tong Tong. Bring the rest to the others,” she said. Lin Qiao nodded, then walked out of the room with the potful of soup, toward Lin Feng’s room.</p> <p>Lin Feng’s room was empty. She didn’t know where they had gone, so she walked in, put the soup on the table, then sensed their vibes and found that they were all on the first floor.</p> <p>‘Yeah, it’s lunchtime. They’re eating downstairs!’</p> <p>Thinking for a moment, Lin Qiao left a note beside the pot to tell those people that the soup was made with one of those turtles downstairs, and was for them.</p> <p>As for whether they dared to drink it or not, that would be up to them.<br/>\nHowever, once she put down the note, her expression changed slightly. She turned to walk to the door, then looked at the stairs with confusion.</p> <p>A while later, some people came upstairs.</p> <p>Lin Feng, Mrs. Lin, Long Qingying and a few others came up. They all looked fine, but Lin Xiaolu, who was lying on Lin Feng’s back, seemed to be a little droopy.</p> <p>The group of people were a little surprised when finding Lin Qiao standing by the door of their room.<br/>\n“Eh? Miss. Lu, were you looking for us?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao pointed at the pot on the table and said, “I was making some soup for Tong Tong. Then, I thought of Xiaolu, so I made more and brought it here for you. But, you were downstairs for lunch.” While speaking, she stepped aside, glancing at Lin Xiaolu.</p> <p>Lin Feng smiled and said, “Ah, thank you, we just had lunch! Maybe, you should bring it back for Tong Tong.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao spread her hands and said, “Tong Tong can’t finish it alone.”</p> <p>Lin Feng and the others walked into the room and found the large potful of soup. Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Qiao, then smiled and said, “It’s alright, we’re only half-full. We can still have some soup.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao quickly nodded.</p> <p>The group of people sat down on the couch. Mr. Lin picked up the note and read it, then a dim light flashed across her light. However, she quickly concealed it as she turned to say to Lin Qiao smilingly, “Is this made from those mutant turtles? Is it safe for us?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over and leaned against the door as she said, “It’s safe is you trust me. Besides, I’ve let Tong Tong drink it, and he has been healthy the whole time. But, I’m curious about what happened to Xiaolu now. She looks a little tired, why?”</p> <p>In fact, Lin Xiaolu was already unconscious.</p> <p>Lin Feng put Lin Xiaolu on the couch, then gently patted her face with confusion.</p> <p>“Xiaolu? Eh…Why did she fall asleep?” However, Lin Feng didn’t pay too much attention to his daughter. He thought that she was sleep, so he put her on the couch and let her lie down.</p> <p>“She looked a little tired during the lunch just now,” said Mrs. Lin, “Maybe she played too much.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao narrowed her eyes and saw that a stream of energy slowly seeping out from deep inside Lin Xiaolu’s body. The tiny amount of energy seeped into Lin Xiaolu’s vines, seeming to gather together.</p> <p>Lin Feng turned to look at the steaming soup on the table. He sensed a nice aroma, yet didn’t seem to want to taste it. Mrs. Lin smiled and said to him, “Lin Feng, just have some. I think it’s safe.”</p> <p>While speaking, she gave Lin Qiao a meaningful glance.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pretended not to sense it, but smiled and said, “It’s alright! It’s understandable if you don’t dare to taste it. After all, it’s made from a mutant turtle. I can sense if the virus existed inside mutant animals and plants, which is why I feed Tong Tong with those mutant foods. Maybe you don’t believe it, but I think that’s one of my abilities.”</p>",
  "Chapter 244: Lin Xiaolu Has A Fever": "<p>Lin Feng and the others glanced at each other, then turned to Lin Qiao while thinking. After that, they nodded knowingly.</p> <p>“I see…That’s wonderful! So, you’re like a detector, and you’ll know which mutant foods are edible and which aren’t?” Mrs. Lin said half-jokingly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her brows and responded with a faint smile, “I don’t mind you calling me that. But, it’s not the time to talk about that. I have a feeling that something is going wrong with Xiaolu.”</p> <p>Lin Feng and Mr. Lin paused slightly, then turned to look at Lin Xiaolu confusedly. Neither of them detected anything abnormal.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?” Lin Feng turned back to Lin Qiao and asked. She unclasped her hands and walked over as she said, “Touch her head and see if she’s having a fever.”</p> <p>Lin Feng turned back and reached out a hand to touch his daughter’s forehead. In the next instant, his face darkened slightly. Seeing her son’s reaction, Mrs. Lin began worrying. “What?” She asked with concern.</p> <p>“She’s a little hot,” said Lin Feng while looking at the asleep little girl. “How did you know?” He turned and asked Lin Qiao. Hearing that, Mrs. Lin couldn’t remain sitting. She hurriedly stood up and walked to Lin Xiaolu. As she pushed away Lin Feng’s hand and touched the little girl herself, she found that Lin Xiaolu was really having a fever.</p> <p>“Xiaolu? Xiaolu, wake up, Xiaolu!” She gently patted Lin Xiaolu’s face and tried to wake her up. However, the latter made no reaction at all. She didn’t even move her eyelids.</p> <p>“What…What happened to her?” Mrs. Lin said anxiously with a frown.<br/>\nLong Qingying, who stood aside, now got closer and looked at Lin Qiao, then turned to Lin Xiaolu with both worry and confusion.<br/>\nLin Feng looked at Lin Xiaolu, then bent over to try waking her up, “Xiaolu? Xiaolu? Xiaolu, wake up! Look at Daddy!”</p> <p>However, she still didn’t react.</p> <p>Seeing that, the group of people all got anxious, constantly shaking her as they tried to wake her up.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over and pulled Lin Feng away, “Stop shouting! She has fainted.” Once she said that, both Lin Feng and Mrs. Lin turned to her with surprise and asked, “She has been healthy. How could she suddenly faint?”</p> <p>“Water…water…Can’t your water heal people?” Mrs. Lin abruptly said to Lin Qiao. The latter shook her head and said, “My water should be useless, because I think she’s triggering her power right now.”</p> <p>Lin Feng and Mrs. Lin stared at her and said in one voice, “What did you say? Triggering her power?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao narrowed her eyes to look at the energy inside Lin Xiaolu’s body, then nodded. Mrs. Lin couldn’t believe this. “How can this happen? She’s so young. Can she possibly trigger a power?” She asked.</p> <p>Some people triggered superpowers after the apocalypse, but none of them was a child. At least, no one had heard about any child who managed to trigger a superpower.</p> <p>The look on Lin Feng’s face turned serious. If a child were triggering a superpower, he or she wouldn’t be able to get through the fever. Children weren’t as strong as adults, so the fever might hurt them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood Lin Feng’s concern. “Lin Feng,” she said, “you take her into my space. I know how to control her body temperature temporarily.”</p> <p>Lin Feng’s eyes glowed as he raised his head to look at Lin Qiao. Meanwhile, Mrs. Lin asked with confusion, “Why do they have to enter your space? Can’t you bring out what you need from your space?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her, then shook her head and said, “I can’t take it out. She has to come into my space.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Qiao with hesitation, then turned to Lin Feng, waiting for him to make the decision. She wasn’t sure if the other should be trusted or not. Even though Lin Qiao had saved them, she would still worry about her son and granddaughter if they entered her space, as she wouldn’t be able to see them.</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at Lin Qiao with a frown, then turned to Mrs. Lin and said, “Mom, I trust her. We have no other choice right now. Xiaolu won’t be able to hold on for long if the fever continues.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin stared at him nervously as she opened her mouth, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>Lin Feng touched Lin Xiaolu’s head again, then found that during this short while, her body temperature had risen further. He hurriedly lifted his daughter, then looked at Lin Qiao and asked, “Alright, what should I do?”</p> <p>“Nothing, just hold her,” Lin Qiao pressed a hand on his shoulder and said.<br/>\nAfter that, she disappeared from where she was along with Lin Feng and Lin Xiaolu, leaving Mrs. Lin and the others waiting in the room with anxious looks.</p> <p>At this moment, Lin Wenwen and Cheng Wangxue came upstairs as well. They first looked around the room, but didn’t find Lin Xiaolu and Lin Feng.</p> <p>“Eh? Where’s Lin Feng and Xiaolu? Mom, are you feeling unwell?” Cheng Wangxue first asked about her daughter and husband, then noticed the strange look on Mrs. Lin’s face, so she hurriedly asked the second question.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen had caught the aroma of the soup, then found the pot on the table. As she prepared to check the soup, she suddenly heard Cheng Wangxue’s words. She paused briefly, then turned to her mother and found her standing in the room with an anxious look. She didn’t know what had happened.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin put her fists before her chest as she looked at Cheng Wangxue and Lin Wenwen and said, “Ah, Xiaolu suddenly had a fever and fainted. Lu Tianyu said that she’s going to trigger a power. And then, she brought Lin Feng and Xiaolu into her space. I don’t know what’s going to happen next.”</p> <p>“What? Triggering a power?” Hearing that, the two had their expressions changed and Cheng Wangxue even yelled out.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen looked at her mother with disbelief while saying, “How can Xiaolu suddenly trigger a power? She’s only seven! She’s too young! What should we do? When triggering the power, her body temperature will rise drastically. Even adults can be hurt by the fever! She…”</p> <p>She was right. Only ten or twenty percent of all zombies could successfully trigger superpowers. As for human beings, only seventy percent of them were able to wake up from the fever and use their powers; the rest thirty percent would fail.</p> <p>The ones who failed either had their brains damaged, or suffered a brain death and ended up in a vegetative state, or died.</p> <p>For this reason, Mrs. Lin was worried so badly after hearing that Xiaolu was triggering a power.</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue suddenly looked at Mrs. Lin with hope in her eyes as she said, “Lu Tianyu knows how to solve the problem, doesn’t she? Otherwise, why would she bring Xiao Lu and Lin Feng into her space?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin shook her head and responded with both helplessness and concern, “I’m not sure. She said she might can help…but not guarantee.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen brought Cheng Wangxue to the couch and made her sit down, then made her mother sit down as well. After that, she sighed and comforted them both, “Calm down, my brother is there! He’ll figure out a way to wake Xiaolu up.”</p> <p>However, she found her own words not so convincing to even herself.</p>",
  "Chapter 245 -  Being A Good Zombie Is Hard": "<p>After entering the space, Lin Qiao and Lin Feng showed up by the lakeside.<br/>\nThe latter was unconscious the last time he was in here, so this was his first time seeing Lin Qiao’s space. While observing the space, he had also been paying attention to her.</p> <p>The space was larger than he had thought, and there was an actual lake in it. On the other side of the space was a large grassland and the strange-looking forest by the edge. All kinds of furniture pieces and kitchenware were placed on one side of the grassland.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the grassland was a pile of mutant pumpkins and potatoes. Lin Feng guessed that Lin Qiao stored those in her space because they were all edible.</p> <p>Right next to the two of them was a stone stove, a chair, some buckets, pots, and bowls. Many parts of this space were showing that it was a habitable space. The lake could provide people with water, and those pumpkins and potatoes could serve as food.</p> <p>“Viney,” Lin Qiao stood by the lakeside and abruptly shouted at the lake.<br/>\nLin Feng glanced at her with surprise, wondering what did she mean. Was she calling someone? Or what?</p> <p>Then, a few arm-thick vines rose from the peaceful lake surface. The vines swayed above the water, then actually reached toward Lin Feng and Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Feng automatically took a step backward, as he had a bad feeling.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him and said, “What are you afraid of? This is Viney, a vine plant living in my space. I don’t know exactly what kind of creature it is, but it’s conscious. The lake water has a healing power because of its help.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Feng relaxed a little bit. After all, Viney wasn’t a mysterious creature to Lin Qiao, and it had something to do with healing.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched Viney reaching the vines toward her while continuing to Lin Feng, “Viney won’t hurt people, as long as you don’t offend it…”</p> <p>Viney wouldn’t hurt people, but it could eat people. Lin Qiao didn’t tell that to Lin Feng, as she was afraid that he might overreact.</p> <p>Anyway, Lin Feng calmed down, putting Lin Xiaolu on the chair nearby. Then, he touched her forehead and found that she was even hotter than before. He couldn’t care about anything else, only wanting to know what he should do next to help his daughter.</p> <p>“You said you may have a way to help. What’s your idea?” He asked Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spread her hand and said, “The idea isn’t mine. We need to ask Viney.”</p> <p>At that moment, the vines avoided Lin Feng and moved toward Lin Qiao. Soon, a vine coiled onto Lin Qiao’s leg and gently wrapped around her wrist.</p> <p>‘Mama, mama, this is the man you brought here last time. Who’s this little sister?’ Asked Viney. Lin Qiao responded in her head, ‘This man is my brother, and this little sister is my niece. But don’t tell him about that, because it’s our secret.’</p> <p>‘Ah…alright…Eh? Is this little sister asleep?’ Viney responded without fully understanding.</p> <p>Lin Qiao said, ‘The energy inside the little sister’s body seems to be abnormal. You go check her and see if you can help order her energy. She’s triggering her power.’</p> <p>Lin Feng was confused a little on seeing Lin Qiao remain silent with a vine wrapped around her hand, only staring at his daughter. At that point, Lin Qiao said to him, “Let Viney check Xiaolu’s body condition. Her energy has started to disorder.”</p> <p>As more and more energy was generated inside her body, Lin Xiaolu’s body temperature was growing higher and higher. Lin Feng looked at Lin Qiao with hesitation and asked, “Are you sure?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Yeah, I’m sure! Your only choice is to believe me right now, isn’t it?”</p> <p>She understood that Lin Feng had no better idea, and could only believe her. Lin Feng couldn’t tell what would happen at last, and he wasn’t willing to believe that the vine was able to save Xiaolu.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Viney, then pointed at Xiao Lu and said, “Viney, go and see if you can wake her up.”</p> <p>Lin Feng didn’t know why Lin Qiao talked to a plant, but he didn’t say anything.</p> <p>‘Sure!’</p> <p>Vines responded, but didn’t unwrap her wrist. Instead, it sent anther vine toward Lin Xiaolu. Seeing that a vine was actually coming at him, Lin Feng couldn’t help but get a little nervous. However, he understood that he had to trust Lin Qiao, and couldn’t make any other move.</p> <p>He watched the vine, which had two tiny leaves at its head, crawl to her daughter’s feet like a snake, then coil around her ankles.</p> <p>Next, the two leaves shook slightly.</p> <p>A few seconds later, Viney said to Lin Qiao, ‘Mama, I can filter her energy, but we need to get her down in the lake…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then looked at Lin Feng and said, “Viney said that the energy inside Xiaolu’s body needs to be filtered. But to do that, we need to get her down in the lake.”</p> <p>Lin Feng didn’t quite understand, so he asked, “What do you mean by getting her down in the lake? Are you going to take Xiaolu into the lake?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao responded, “We need to take Xiaolu down to the bottom of the lake. But don’t worry, she’s gonna be fine. Viney is able to control her respiratory system and protect her from suffocation.”</p> <p>Lin Feng popped his eyes in shock, as he could scarcely believe what Lin Qiao had said.</p> <p>How could he put his daughter to the bottom of the lake! He didn’t know how deep that lake was, or what was in that lake. What if something happened to her?</p> <p>He wore a dark face and didn’t say a word in a while.</p> <p>Lin Feng honestly didn’t believe Lin Qiao. However, he couldn’t think of a thing to do to help his daughter. So now, he wasn’t sure if he should choose to trust Lin Qiao or not.</p> <p>What if an accident happened after his daughter went down into the lake?</p> <p>But soon, he chose to believe the other, because in the current situation, her daughter would be hopeless if he refused to believe. At the very least, Lin Qiao was offering hope.</p> <p>He couldn’t watch his daughter’s body temperature go higher and higher, until she got hurt, could he?</p> <p>Thus, he nodded and said, “Okay, but…”</p> <p>He stared at Lin Qiao, his eyes saying that if anything happened to his daughter, he would fight Lin Qiao with his life.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shrugged and nodded at him carelessly. But on the inside, she complained about the fact that she would get suspected every time she tried to save some people. Well, being a good zombie was really difficult!</p> <p>With that thought, she said to Viney, “Alright, Viney, you can begin.”</p> <p>Receiving her order, Viney immediately moved over its other few vines, wrapping up Lin Xiaolu’s limbs. Then, it lifted her from the chair and moved her into the lake.</p> <p>Lin Feng maintained a calm look, his eyes fixed on Lin Xiaolu. But in fact, his pulse was throbbing in his throat, as he was so worried but couldn’t do anything.</p>",
  "Chapter 246: Wait Anxiously": "<p>Viney brought Lin Xiaolu to the middle of the lake, a meter higher than the water surface. Then, more vines rose from the water and slowly wrapped her up. After that, she sunk into the lake in front of Lin Feng and Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced back at Lin Feng’s clenched fist and remained silent.<br/>\nShe had sensed that Viney had brought Lin Xiaolu into the lake. She wasn’t able to sense the energy inside Lin Xiaolu’s body clearly, but she felt that it had somehow quieted down a few seconds after Xiaolu was brought into the water.</p> <p>At that moment, she and Lin Feng were like family members waiting outside the operating room. Their hearts were filled with hope and concern, yet they couldn’t do anything except anxiously wait by the lake.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Lin Qiao wasn’t as nervous as Lin Feng was, because she was able to sense the things down in the lake, hazily though. Unlike her, Lin Feng was now like an ant in a burning pot. But still, he managed to remain calm and keep himself from panicking.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him and couldn’t bear watching him being so anxious. So, she said, “Xiaolu’s energy was stabilized after she got down into the water. Viney knows what to do. Xiaolu should be safe, so you don’t need to worry.”</p> <p>Lin Feng paused, then raised his head to look at her. Hearing her words, he somehow relaxed a little and sighed in relief, then figured that Lin Qiao might have said that only to ease his anxiety.</p> <p>“Thank you!” Lin Feng looked at Lin Qiao’s purely black eyes and said with sincere gratitude. Lin Qiao nodded at him, then turned back to the lake, closing her eyes to carefully sense the world down in the water.</p> <p>A while later, she opened her eyes and said, “Although Xiaolu is in a stable condition now, Viney still needs to filter out the excessive energy and trigger her energy nucleus, so it may take some time.”</p> <p>“So, you need to be patient, and wait.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded knowingly, then asked, “Can you sense the things down in the lake?”</p> <p>“A little, but not clearly enough,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at her and didn’t say more words, but turned to stare at the lake surface as well. He understood that he needed to be patient, but after two hours, he had started getting anxious again. He glanced at Lin Qiao for a few times, and the latter told him about what was happening in the lake before he asked.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s explanation, Lin Feng calmed back down again.<br/>\nLin Qiao and Lin Feng, who were waiting by the lake, were relatively composed; but unlike them, the group of people outside just couldn’t calm down.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wasn’t there, and neither was Qiu Lili. So, after waiting in the room for about two hours, Cheng Wangxue and the others started to be driven crazy by anxiety. At last, they couldn’t help but go to Liu Jun’s room to find her.</p> <p>Xie Dong, who stayed in that room, showed his face as well, following Liu Jun to protect her. He was worried that Cheng Wangxue and her family might get emotional and end up doing something unreasonable to Liu Jun.</p> <p>“Can she really solve Xiaolu’s problem? It has been about two hours, but why haven’t we heard anything yet? Why didn’t they come out to tell us about what’s happening now? I’m really worried,” Mrs. Lin clasped her hands as she said while pacing in the room.</p> <p>Liu Jun was sitting on the couch, and Tong Tong was playing on her knees. “Madam, please calm down! Our Captain has the solution, or she wouldn’t bring Xiaolu into her space. When they’re out, Xiaolu might have become a superpowered one, the youngest among all.”</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue sat beside Liu Jun and tightened her face, fists clenched on her knees. While listening to Liu Jun, she tried very hard to comfort and tell herself that Liu Jun was right.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen glanced at Cheng Wangxue, then at her mother, then at Liu Jun. She was worried too; she didn’t know what to say to comfort the others, but only waited anxiously with them.</p> <p>Long Qingying, who was remaining silent the whole time, now joined the conversation, “I believe in Junjun. Xiaolu is gonna be fine.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao had saved her life a few times, and she had visited her space. Added with the fact that Tong Tong, who was now in Liu Jun’s arms, had been living a good life, she somehow believed that Lin Qiao must know how to help Lin Xiaolu.</p> <p>Hearing her, the others relaxed a little bit.</p> <p>But two more hours later, people started getting nervous again. Cheng Wangxue stood up and paced before the window which was behind the couch while Mrs. Lin was sitting on the couch, sighing endlessly.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen walked to Long Qingying and asked with a low voice, “Can she really wake Xiaolu up? And, is Xiaolu really triggering a superpower? How could she suddenly begin triggering a superpower? That should be impossible!”</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at her and replied, “I don’t know for sure. But, there’s something living inside her lake. She brought Xiaolu into her space, so I guess that she went to ask that thing in the lake for help.”</p> <p>Earlier on, Yang Cheng was drained after being thrown into that lake. Recalling that now still made Long Qingying shiver out of fear.</p> <p>At that moment, Liu Jun turned to say to them both, “You forgot that we’re zombies. Our Captain is very sensitive to energies. She said that Xiaolu is triggering a superpower, so it must be true. Moreover, Long Qingying is right…I think our Captain went to Viney for help. They’ve been in the space for so long, so I think they’re making some progress. Otherwise, they would have come out long ago.”</p> <p>Once she said that, the others all saw hope.</p> <p>She was right! Since it had been so long, there should be a great chance for the problem to be solved. After all, if Lin Qiao’s plan didn’t work, she should have sent Lin Feng and Lin Xiaolu out long ago.</p> <p>“Who’s Viney?” Asked Lin Wenwen with surprise.</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at Liu Jun and asked a question too, “It’s not the one in the lake, is it?”</p> <p>“Yes it is, don’t worry!” Liu Jun nodded and responded with a smile. Ever since the dark circles under Liu Jun’s eyes disappeared, she looked much more energetic than before. Her skin was still a little pale, decorated with some blood streaks’; but aside of that, she was no different from a normal human being. But of course, her eyes were still purely dark.</p> <p>Her smile was warm, but one would have to ignore her eyes to sense the warmth of her smile…</p> <p>The group of comforted people patiently waited for more couple of hours, until it was dark.</p> <p>By that time, something finally happened in Lin Qiao’s space. A vibration spread from the center of the lake, and the lake surface was immediately stirred.</p> <p>“That’s it! She’s getting up,” Lin Qiao stared at the lake center and said abruptly. Lin Feng was refreshed by this news. He looked at Lin Qiao and asked, “Then Xiaolu is…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao smilingly glanced at him, then nodded and said, “She’s fine! The vibration is caused by the formation of her energy nucleus. So now, Viney is sending her up.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Feng relaxed a lot, then turned to the lake with anticipation.</p>",
  "Chapter 247: She’s Finally Out": "<p>Soon, the water in the lake center began waving, and a vine raised Lin Xiaolu’s flawless body from the lake; letting her float on the water surface while facing the sky, and bringing her toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hurriedly found a towel and a dress from Qiu Lili’s closet. Meanwhile, Lin Feng took Lin Xiaolu over from the vine and carried her toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao waited by a couch; as Lin Feng carried Xiaolu over, she put her down on the couch, then began wiping her body with the towel.</p> <p>Lin Feng was holding his naked daughter. He was surprised, as his daughter’s clothes were all done; but what he was worried more about was her body condition.</p> <p>After checking, he found that Lin Xiaolu’s body temperature had dropped, and now was even a little lower than usual. Her breath was stable, and so was her heartbeat. He also lifted her eyelids and found that her pupils seemed to be normal.</p> <p>Only after that did Lin Feng finally stop worrying.</p> <p>Lin Qiao dried Lin Xiaolu’s body, then put the dress on her. Afterward, she began drying her long and wet hair.</p> <p>Before, Lin Feng didn’t pay attention to Lin Qiao’s movement. But now, after calming down, he noticed how practiced she seemed to be in taking care of Lin Xiaolu. He was puzzled at first, then was inclined to believe a guess of his even deeper than before.</p> <p>“When will Xiaolu wake up?” He asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao responded while wiping Xiaolu’s hair, “Em, I guess it’ll take one or two more hours. Touch her forehead…you should be able to sense her energy nucleus right now.”</p> <p>She didn’t need to touch Lin Xiaolu’s forehead, as she had already sensed the little girl’s energy nucleus. Right now, she was curious about what kind of power Lin Xiaolu had.</p> <p>Hearing her, Lin Feng immediately put a hand on his daughter’s forehead. Then, he gathered a slight amount of energy in his palm which was pressing against Lin Xiaolu’s forehead.</p> <p>As she had said, he did sense a slight energy wave from Lin Xiaolu’s head.</p> <p>“It’s real! Xiaolu does have a power now!” He murmured with surprise.</p> <p>At that moment, Viney suddenly coiled a vine on Lin Qiao’s hand and sent her a message. Soon after that, it unwrapped her, and then all the vines drew back into the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao paused for a second, but didn’t make other reaction. She looked at Lin Feng and said, “Alright, you carry her. I’ll send you outside. The others are worried sick.”</p> <p>Lin Feng was immediately reminded of Mrs. Lin and the others, so he hurriedly lifted his daughter and stood up. After that, Lin Qiao put a hand on his shoulder and brought both of them out.</p> <p>As the group of people were waiting anxiously, the two suddenly showed up in the room. The people were shocked at first, then realized what had happened.</p> <p>“Lin Feng, how’s Xiaolu!” Cheng Wangxue immediately sprung up from the couch. She would have collapsed if she hadn’t been trying too hard to control herself.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin, Lin Wenwen, and the others all hurriedly came over to touch Lin Xiaolu, all afraid that they might touch a cold body.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood aside and saw that Xie Dong standing by Liu Jun’s side. She nodded at the two of them, then turned to say to the others, “Alright, alright, Xiaolu is fine! Don’t worry, put her in bed and cover her with a blanket. She’ll wake up when her body temperature rises to the normal level.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin, Cheng Wangxue, and all the others had touched Lin Xiaolu’s body. Her body temperature was a little low, but thankfully, her body wasn’t icy-cold, and was still warm.</p> <p>Finally, the group of people stopped worrying.</p> <p>“Ah, I was worried sick! Thankfully, she’s fine!” Mrs. Lin said while patting her own chest.</p> <p>“Is she really fine? There won’t be a problem, right? Her brain isn’t damaged, is it? And her body…her body is unharmed, right? Will any problem occur after she wakes up?” Cheng Wangxue was still worrying about her daughter, so she followed Lin Feng and kept asking questions.</p> <p>“Is Xiaolu a superpowered one now? She’s the youngest superpowered human being. If we train her well, she’ll become powerful when she grows up, won’t she?” Lin Wenwen also followed behind Lin Feng and asked curiously.</p> <p>Lin Feng put the girl on the bed. The others helped to lift the blanket, then covered Xiaolu with it.</p> <p>“It’s alright, Xiaolu is healthy!” said Lin Qiao, “In fact, she’s healthier than any of you in this room. Let her rest for a while. She’ll wake up soon.”</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Feng turned to say to Lin Qiao seriously, “Thank you! You saved our family once more! We’ve owed you too much.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed his sincerity as she carelessly waved a hand at him.</p> <p>“Xiaolu is so adorable, so how can I not help her? I’ll do whatever to help you as long as I can,” she said. Hearing their conversation, Mrs. Lin and the others all turned back to glance at Lin Qiao with gratitude.</p> <p>Liu Jun carried Tong Tong over and asked Lin Qiao with curiosity, “Do you know what power Xiaolu has triggered?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “I don’t know! She’ll have to figure that out by herself after waking up.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Liu Jun glanced at Lin Xiaolu, who was lying in bed, with curiosity.</p> <p>“Mom, why is Sister Xiaolu asleep?” Tong Tong asked in her arms, “Isn’t she getting up to play?”</p> <p>Liu Jun smiled at him and replied, “Sister Xiaolu is sick. She’s tired right now, so she needs to rest.”</p> <p>Tong Tong nodded knowingly and responded, “Ah, I see!”</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao had sensed the thoughts in his little head.</p> <p>‘So, she’s sick…What does sick mean? She’s sick so she needs to rest? But why rest?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Tong Tong with a smile, then turned to look at the potful of soup. Then, she walked to the table and lifted the lid of the pot. Even though it had been covered, the soup was still a little cold by now.</p> <p>She turned to say to Lin Wenwen, “Lin Wenwen, you and Long Qingying go heat this soup up. Later when Xiaolu wakes up, you can give her some of the soup. Besides, it’s dinner time now. Don’t miss your dinner.”</p> <p>“Okay,” Lin Wenwen waited for her to finish speaking, then responded a little confusedly.</p> <p>After saying that, Lin Qiao turned and left the room, Liu Jun and Xie Dong following behind her.</p> <p>As the three of then left, Lin Wenwen suddenly caught a weird feeling. For some reason, when Lin Qiao said that to her just now, she felt that the one talking to her was her elder sister.</p> <p>The familiar tone of talking, and familiar words…</p> <p>Lin Wenwen tilted her head with confusion, then carried the pot out of the room with Long Qingying while thinking.</p> <p>Back in the zombies’ room, Liu Jun asked Lin Qiao who had sat down on the couch, “Eh, didn’t you say that Viney doesn’t have enough energy? How did it manage to suppress Xiaolu’s energy without using its own?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and responded slowly, as if in deep thoughts, “It’s not like that. Viney has used up the last bit of energy…It’s sleeping now. Only after it has absorbed enough energy will it wake up again.”</p> <p>The last message that Viney sent her was to tell her about that. It had spent five or six hours to order and filter Lin Xiaolu’s energy. How could that not consume any of Viney’s own energy? Viney had used up the last bit of its own energy to fix Xiaolu’s problem.</p>",
  "Chapter 248: You Can Call Me Aunty": "<p>Liu Jun nodded knowingly and said, “Ah, I see! So, we might have to wait for Lili to bring back some zombie nuclei to wake Viney up. And, when do you think Deputy Chief Yuan will come back? He’s been away for quite a few days.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Xie Dong, then said, “Yuan Tianxing went to Sea City Base. He was going to meet Wu Chengyue, but that man isn’t in the base. As the man with cooperative intentions isn’t there, he’ll look for another potential partner. Xie Dong, do you think he’ll pick Yang Chao or Zou Shihui?”</p> <p>While speaking, she took out the clipboard and handed it to Xie Dong.</p> <p>Xie Dong took over the clipboard, then picked up the pen and wrote, ‘Yang Chao has no interest in cooperating with people from the outside. He’s all about strengthening the base. As for the diplomatic work, he’ll leave them to his two Deputy Chiefs.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Which means, even if Wu Chengyue is back in the base, he won’t lend too many people to Yuan Tianxing. So, I guess Yuan Tianxing will try to hire some people in Sea City Base with food. However, we don’t know if those people are willing to work for him?”</p> <p>Liu Jun carried Tong Tong and sat on the bedside, then looked at Lin Qiao and said, “Are you saying that Deputy Chief Yuan will need to spend a long while there?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded; due to the above reasons, they needed to wait, for both Qiu Lili and Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Two hours later, about nine o’clock in the evening, Lin Feng, Cheng Wangxue, and Lin Xiaolu—who had woken up—came to Lin Qiao’s room and asked to see her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had cleaned the room in front of Liu Jun’s and settled down temporarily. Her room was next to Xie Dong’s.</p> <p>Hearing the knock on the door, she walked to the door and opened it, then saw Lin Feng and his family.</p> <p>“Eh? Xiaolu has woken up! Come in…” Lin Qiao first observed Lin Xiaolu who was raising her head to look at her, then stood aside and invited the guests in.</p> <p>Lin Feng was wearing his symbolic serious look again. He nodded at Lin Qiao, then walked into the room.</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue held Lin Xiaolu’s hand and guided her into the room. Then, she looked at her while pointing at Lin Qiao and said, “Here, Xiaolu, thank this sister! When you were having a fever and were in a coma, this sister saved you. You need to be grateful, do you know that?”</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu obediently nodded, then looked at Lin Qiao adorably and said, “Thank you, sister…”</p> <p>“Eh, don’t call me sister…Call me aunt. I’m so old, so it’s a little strange for you to call me sister…” Lin Qiao was a little speechless on hearing Cheng Wangxue, so she hurriedly interrupted Lin Xiaolu.</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu didn’t know that Lin Qiao was her aunty yet, but she could call her aunt. If she called her sister, it would be wrong. If Lin Qiao let Xiaolu call her sister, Lin Feng as her brother would be like her uncle, and her mother would be like her grandma…That was unacceptable!</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue said with surprise, “How so? You look young.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao guided Cheng Wangxue and the little girl to the couch and made them sit down, then waved her hands toward Cheng Wangxue and said, “No, no, she has to call me aunt, or aunty.”</p> <p>As Lin Qiao insisted, Cheng Wangxue had no other choice but to smilingly say to her daughter, “Alright, call aunt…”</p> <p>Before she finished, Lin Feng, who stood aside, abruptly joined the conversation, “Call her Aunty…Aunty sounds better.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Cheng Wangxue looked at Lin Feng, each with a strange look. Lin Qiao felt that Aunty sounded more appropriate, but she surely wouldn’t tell that to Lin Feng. However, the reason given by him was strange as well.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue was also staring at Lin Feng with a weird expression. As the atmosphere suddenly turned a little awkward, Lin Qiao immediately changed the topic, “Ahyaya, you can call me anything. Come on, Xiaolu, you can decide what to call me.”</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu was going to call her Aunt, but before she said a word, she received a threatening glance from her father. Therefore, she corrected herself and called Lin Qiao, “Then, I’ll call you Aunty…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao smilingly nodded, then asked her, “What’s your power? Can you use it?”</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu shook her head with puzzles on her face, “I don’t know yet.”</p> <p>“It won’t be so soon. You may have to wait for two or three days,” said Lin Feng expressionlessly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know much about the awakening of superpowers in human beings. Lu Tianyu had no clear memories about that either, as she only cared about her appearance.</p> <p>“Yeah, people have to wait for a couple of days after waking up, before they can use their powers,” said Cheng Wangxue, “So now, we don’t know what power Xiaolu has. But, we really need to thank you for helping her trigger her power.”</p> <p>“You’re very welcome…” Lin Qiao carelessly shook her head and responded smilingly. However, before she finished talking, the smile on her face froze. She suddenly turned to look outside the window, and her dark eyes glowed with a mysterious light.</p> <p>Lin Feng and Cheng Wangxue were puzzled because of the sudden change of her expression. Then, they both looked outside the window. However, it was all dark out there, and they detected nothing unusual.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?” Cheng Wangxue couldn’t help but ask curiously. Lin Qiao stood up and moved aside as she replied, “Don’t move, I’ll go and check!”</p> <p>She flashed to the wall next to the window, then gazed outside with one eye. About a mile away, on a tall building that Lin Feng and his wife couldn’t see, a spot of light was sparkling from time to time, looking like the glistening of a mirror.</p> <p>“You go back to your room and keep an eye on the others!” Lin Qiao said to Lin Feng and Cheng Wangxue abruptly in a serious tone. After that, she disappeared from where she was.</p> <p>Lin Feng and Cheng Wangue were left in confusion, glancing at each other.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned herself invisible, then darted out through the window. She quickly climbed onto the roof on all fours, then stood on the guardrail as she raised her head to sniff at the air.</p> <p>As she had thought, she had grasped the scents of a group of human being. The scent of one among those people was very familiar to her, as he was the next on her killing list.</p> <p>After confirming the identities of those people, Lin Qiao leaned her body and leaped off the roof. After she fell for four or five floors, she suddenly reached out a hand and accurately grasped a guardrail, then flipped in the air and jumped into a balcony.</p> <p>Afterward, she darted to the right side of the balcony from the left side, then hopped into the other balcony. After that, she jumped into the room at the front and leaped out of the balcony of that room. Next, she jumped onto the balcony below and arrived at a room on the fourth floor, on the other side of the building.</p> <p>She entered the room from the balcony, which was empty. She then quickly walked out, to the door of Liu Jun’s room.</p> <p>After knocking the door, she opened it and walked into Liu Jun’s room.</p> <p>Liu Jun was lulling Tong Tong to sleep. As Lin Qiao came in and closed the door from inside, she asked with a low voice, “What’s wrong?”</p>",
  "Chapter 249: Yang Jianhua Shows Up Again": "<p>Liu Jun’s room was located in the backside of the hotel, so she couldn’t see anything in front of the hotel, and no one could look into the room from downstairs.</p> <p>The rooms with balconies that Lin Qiao came down from were all on the front side of the hotel, which meant the people she saw were about a mile away from the hotel on the front side.</p> <p>She walked to the couch and sat down while speaking, “You’ve recollected your memories, so I suppose you know what Yang Jianhua did, don’t you? Last time, when I saved Lin Feng and the others, I heard their conversation. Did that Yang Jianhua really do something to me…and I can’t remember it?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Liu Jun paused slightly, then glanced at Tong Tong, who was already in a deep sleep. After that, she quietly stood up from the bed, walked to the couch, and sat down next to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Looking at her son, she said with a gentle voice, “I don’t know the details. I guess you’ve roughly found out what happened. As for if he really saved your life or faked it, you need to dig it up by yourself from your lost memories.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao frowned, lowering her head slightly and falling into deep thoughts.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua was no longer a stranger to her. From Lin Feng, his people, Long Qingying, and Du Yuanxing, she had learned about what happened. In the story, she was the victim. However, she felt nothing, as if she was listening to someone else’s story.</p> <p>Liu Jun turned to look at her with surprise and asked, “Why suddenly ask about him? What do you plan to do to him?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her and responded, “He’s showed up. He’s about a thousand meters away at the front side of the hotel, observing us.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Liu Jun’s face immediately darkened. “How dare he come back! Didn’t Lili drive him away last time?” She said with a cold voice.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rested her chin on her hands while saying, “I guess he’s been lingering in this area and observing us from the darkness. Earlier on, I wasn’t here, and I didn’t notice him when I came back. He’s now relaxing his vigilance slightly, maybe because he saw Lili leave this afternoon. I think he’ll do something before Lili comes back. We’ll find out tomorrow morning.”</p> <p>Liu Jun immediately knitted her brows and asked with concern, “What should we do then? Even though there’re lots of ordinary zombies hundreds of meters from here, they can’t stop the superpowered ones above level four…Not to mention the fact that Yang Jianhua is at the top of level-six, and is just a step away from level-seven.”</p> <p>“We don’t need to worry about that,” Lin Qiao said carelessly, “We might not be able to defeat him, but can’t we hide? As long as I’m here, it’s unnecessary for us to worry about that.”</p> <p>While speaking, she glanced at Liu Jun, who was enlightened by her words. She nodded and said, “Ah, yeah, we can hide in your space. I forgot about that. But, that Yang Jianhua is so insistent about pursuing Lin Wenwen. It’s so disgusting. He’s a bisexual, isn’t he?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao spread her hands and replied, “How am I supposed to know? I don’t remember him.”</p> <p>Liu Jun looked at her with surprise and continued, “How come you only lost the memories of the past five years? Do you remember the things that happened before the apocalypse?”</p> <p>“Me waking up in another person’s body is already strange enough,” said Lin Qiao, “Losing a couple of years of memory is nothing. Earlier on, I thought I slept for five whole years, but unexpectedly, I just lost my memories.”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded with agreement and said, “You’re right. It surprised me that you actually woke up in another body. Doesn’t the previous owner of your body have any family in Sea City Base?”</p> <p>“There’s one,” Lin Qiao nodded, “I met him a couple of days ago.”</p> <p>“Eh?” Said Liu Jun in surprise, “No way! Weren’t you in the center of Hangzhou City days ago? Did he or she go to that area?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Yeah, he and his team was captured as the food of a zombie king. I passed by and saved them.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a while chatting with Liu Jun, then told the latter to stay alert. After that, she turned and walked out of Junjun’s room, then knocked on Xie Dong’s room. She told him to raise his vigilance, also to keep an eye on Liu Jun and her son.</p> <p>Next, she went to Lin Feng’s room. Mrs. Lin, Lin Wenwen, and the others were all in Lin Feng’s room, including Lin Hao, who didn’t show up often. Once Lin Qiao showed up, they all turned to look at her, as if they had been waiting for her.</p> <p>“What’s the situation?” Lin Feng looked at her and directly asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded as she walked into the room, then sat down on an empty couch and started talking, “Em, it’s Yang Jianhua…He’s watching us.”</p> <p>Hearing Yan Jianhua’s name, Lin Feng and all the others had their faces darkened.</p> <p>“How dare he come back!” said Lin Wenwen immediately, “Isn’t he afraid that Qiu Lili will beat him again?”</p> <p>Lin Hao, who was cutting a branch, swung down his hand and cut off half of the smooth, thin, and sharp tip of the branch.</p> <p>“I don’t know for sure,” said Lin Qiao expressionlessly, “Maybe he never left, or he did, but has returned. I think he knows that Qiu Lili has left this afternoon, which is why he started making big moves tonight, and was noticed by me.”</p> <p>“If Tianxing were here, he would be a match for Yang Jianhua,” said Lin Feng, “But now, neither he nor Lili is here. I think none of us can rival him. Where did Qiu Lili go? She disappeared all the time, but never left for long.”</p> <p>“She went for hunting. I don’t think she’ll be back soon,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Hunting?” Said Lin Wenwen with surprise, “Eh, she’s a zombie queen, and she doesn’t eat human beings. So, what is she hunting?”</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at Lin Wenwen, said, “She can hunt zombies.” After saying that, he turned to look at Lin Qiao, who nodded and said, “You’ve seen what happened to Junjun. Lili wants to be able to talk too. However, her level is high, so fixing her requires a big amount of energy. For that purpose, she needs to find some energy sources.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin frowned and said, “So, what should we do now? Miss. Lu, are you sure that you saw Yang Jianhua nearby? Why didn’t we feel anything? Lin Hao, have you sensed anything at all?” While finishing her question, Mrs. Lin turned to look at Lin Hao, who was in a corner.</p> <p>Lin Hao put the dagger in his hand into the sheath and walked over while fiddling with the branch which was sharpened again.</p> <p>“No. My sensations can reach five or six hundred meters at most. I can only sense the zombie crowd outside, but no one else. Where’s that scum?” While speaking, Lin Hao dragged over a chair and sat down. At last, he looked at Lin Qiao and asked that question.</p> <p>“He’s in a building 1300 meters away,” said Lin Qiao, “Just now, he was observing us with a telescope.”</p> <p>The others all looked at Lin Qiao in surprise, “Can you sense things that far away?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at them with a bland look. Her sensations could reach further than that. If the targets didn’t try to hide their traces, she would be able to sense them from two or three miles away.</p> <p>Moreover, she was able to grasp their scents from the air.</p>",
  "Chapter 250: Hide If You Can’t Win": "<p>Mrs. Lin gave a long sigh as she wore a sullen face. She felt depressed every time she thought of Yang Jianhua. “What should we do? Lin Feng is no match for Yang Jianhua,” she said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave her a comforting smile while saying, “Don’t I have a space? We can’t defeat him, but we can always hide, can’t we? I really want to know what he’s up to.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen said coldly with a dark face, “I don’t want to see him. I’ll feel disgusted!”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin nodded and agreed, “Me neither. I’ll turn blind if I see him again!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up and said, “How about this? You go stay in my space for now. I want to see what he’s trying to do. If he doesn’t leave, Lili will deal with him when she returns. Don’t worry!”</p> <p>Lin Hao gripped the sharpened branch in his hand and said through clenched teeth, “I want to kill him! I can’t do it now, but as long as he stays alive, he’ll die in my hands one day!”</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at the others, then said, “Mom, you, Wangxue, Xiaolu and Wenwen should enter the space now. We’re staying outside to see what’ll happen. If any danger occurs, Miss. Lu will bring us into her space.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin nodded while Cheng Wangxe held Xiaolu in her arms, then glanced at Lin Feng, but remained silent. Lin Qiao walked to Mrs. Lin and gently held her arm; then, both of them disappeared. A couple of seconds later, Lin Qiao showed up again and brought Cheng Wangxue and Lin Xiaolu into her space.</p> <p>After that, Lin Wenwen and the two soldiers named Wei Jingchen and Xiao Wenxing, who didn’t have superpowers, were brought into Lin Qiao’s space as well. Lin Feng, Lin Hao, and Long Qingying, being the relatively stronger ones, stayed outside with Lin Qiao. A small number of people would make escape more convenient. At the very least, no one would slow the others down while escaping.</p> <p>Lin Qiao returned to Liu Jun’s room. At that time, Liu Jun was holding the asleep Tong Tong in her arms and waiting for the former. Xie Dong was standing in the room, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao come in, Liu Jun asked her, “How many people will Yang Jianhua bring here?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and responded, “I’m not sure. But the few superpowered ones around him are all at about level-five, and he has quite some people under his command.”</p> <p>“In fact,” said Liu Jun, “apart from his power, his cars are dangerous too, all armed with powerful weapons. He didn’t use those weapons earlier when he was under Lili’s attack, so I guess he’s saving them for greater use.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded. After sending Liu Jun and Tong Tong into her space, she walked out of the room along with Xie Dong. Returning to Lin Feng’s room, she said to the three inside, “You stay here and see. I’ll go and try finding out what Yang Jianhua is up to. Wait for my message.”</p> <p>While speaking, she walked to the area in front of the door, which couldn’t be seen from outside the window. Then, she turned herself invisible and quietly opened the window before leaping out.</p> <p>The four people who stayed in the room each found a seat. Lin Feng looked at Xie Dong and asked, “Can I ask you a question?”</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at him. After confirming that Lin Feng was talking to him, he nodded with confusion.</p> <p>“This may sound impolite,” said Lin Feng, “Please don’t mind. We haven’t heard you talking, so, have you lost your voice?”</p> <p>Xie Dong frankly nodded to admit that.</p> <p>“Ah, I’m really sorry,” Lin Feng continued, “But, both you and Lu Tianyu are from Sea City Base, right? Why are you with her? Aren’t you afraid of her?”<br/>\nLin Feng wanted to know why wasn’t Xie Dong afraid of the zombie Lu Tianyu, but had the courage to follow her.</p> <p>Xie Dong took out a notebook from the bag tied around his waist, then wrote on it, ‘She’s not a bad zombie. If she wanted to hurt me, she wouldn’t have saved me.’</p> <p>“She saved you?” Lin Feng said with surprise. Then, he glanced at Long Qingying and continued, “I think she likes saving people.”</p> <p>‘She likes saving people?’ Xie Dong thought for a moment. The people who had been saved by Lin Qiao included himself; Tong Tong and his mother; Lu Tianyi and his team; the little princess; Long Qingying, and Du Yuanxing. Except for her own family, the others she rescued weren’t related to her.<br/>\nThinking so, Xie Dong felt that Lin Qiao did like saving people. As same as himself, she used to be a soldier, and soldiers’ duty was to serve the people. So, Xie Dong figured that Lin Qiao considered saving people as what she should do.</p> <p>However, in the post-apocalyptic era, if one helped all whom one found needing help, one might discover some ungrateful ones. In order to survive, the people living in this era had given up on many moral senses. That was why man-eating robbers emerged. In a team, betrayals and internal fights would happen all the time.</p> <p>Even some former soldiers had gradually lost their military spirit. In this world, people now followed the law of the jungle, and the strong ones earned respect.</p> <p>“Was she like that before?” Asked Lin Feng.</p> <p>That question puzzled Xie Dong slightly. He looked at Lin Feng confusedly, then shook his head. Lin Feng didn’t ask more questions, but turned to look outside the window.</p> <p>“Did she really see that scum? Could she be wrong?” said Lin Hao. He had sensed nothing at all, so he didn’t believe Lin Qiao’s words completely.</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at him and said seriously, “I’m not sure either, but trusting her for now is no wrong. Even for the slightest possibility, we need to stay alert, and can’t be careless.”</p> <p>Lin Hao quietly looked at the window. It was all dark outside, and he could see nothing.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao was quietly leaping across the roofs. In the darkness, no creature was able to sense a trace of hers.</p> <p>One-thousand and three-hundred meters only took her a few blinks.<br/>\nShe squatted on top of a streetlight, looking at the top floor of the tall building about ten meters away. It was a residential area, with seven or eight buildings, each having twenty or thirty floors.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua and his people were in the building which was located in the middle of this area. From this building, they were able to see the hotel that Lin Feng and his people were stationed in.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slightly raised her head to look at Yang Jianhua and his people, who were standing on the top floor. She then lowered her head to look around and found no cars that belonged to them. However, she noticed the underground parking in this area, and figured that they had parked their vehicles underground.</p> <p>Lin Qiao used her sensations and found that except for Yang Jianhua himself, a few level-five superpowered people, and quite some level three or four ones were all on the top floor of that building. Those people should all be under his command.</p> <p>Those people were gathering in a room.</p> <p>Lin Qiao leaped off the street light, quietly approaching the residential area. She didn’t enter Yang Jianhua’s building immediately, but headed to the underground parking. It was pitch-dark in there, yet she was able to see everything clearly.</p> <p>She walked down and looked around. As she expected, the few heavily armed vehicles which belonged to Yang Jianhua were parked by the wall.<br/>\nShe stretched her fingers, then walked toward them.</p>",
  "Chapter 251: Why Did You Hit Me?": "<p>A couple of minutes later, Lin Qiao quietly walked out. Down in the underground parking, the vehicles which belonged to Yang Jianhua were gone, and only a few fainted soldiers were left there.</p> <p>To avoid being detected by Yang Jianhua, she had restrained her vibe as much as possible. Therefore, the surrounding ordinary zombies didn’t sense her, but slowly followed the scents of those soldiers to this area.</p> <p>Lin Qiao left the underground parking and found Yang Jianhua’s building through his scent. After that, she swiftly and nimbly climbed up through the external units of the air conditioner.</p> <p>Soon, she easily arrived at the top floor and got into the building from a corridor window. She moved inside along the wall; around a corner, she looked around and found a door guarded by four or five soldiers.</p> <p>She then turned to look at the stairs. As she had thought, that area was guarded as well. She moved to the door as quietly as an invisible ghost, avoiding the few soldiers and standing beside the door.</p> <p>She looked at the closed door before her face. Even though she was as invisible as a ghost, she couldn’t move through the door like a ghost…</p> <p>She crossed her arms before her chest, then turned to look at the soldiers by her sides, who were holding flashlights. Then, she put an ear against the door to try and hear the sounds inside.</p> <p>She only heard the sounds of breathing. There were lots of people in the room, but why was none of them talking?</p> <p>Her arms remained crossed as he turned again to look at the few soldiers guarding by the door. Abruptly, she raised both hands and slapped the faces of the two soldiers by her sides, then flashing to an empty area.</p> <p>“Eh? Why did you hit me?” The two soldiers who each suffered a slap from Lin Qiao turned to each other and yelled angrily.</p> <p>“You hit me first! When did I hit you?”</p> <p>“Damn, did you see me hit you? If you didn’t hit me, who did? You’re the only one in front of me.”</p> <p>“Are you an idiot? I’m standing in front of you, but does that mean that I was the one who hit you? You’re standing in front of me, so you’re the one who hit me, didn’t you?”</p> <p>The two soldiers started arguing without knowing what exactly had happened while the others all looked at them with confusion.</p> <p>“Oi, oi, what happened? Why’re you yelling? Be careful, Chief might come out to punish you!” Another soldier who was carrying a rifle said.</p> <p>The two who were slapped by Lin Qiao pointed at each other and said, “Someone hit me just now. It must be him!”</p> <p>“Eh? Wait a moment! Don’t you feel weird?” The third soldier looked at the two with puzzlement in his eyes.</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>“You were slapped at the same time, but neither of you saw each other doing it. I kinda feel that you were hit by someone else…”</p> <p>“What do you mean?”</p> <p>“Yeah, there’s no one here but us, right? You’re over there, so you can’t possibly hit us without letting us see you doing it, right?”</p> <p>“That makes sense too, but…is someone else here with us?”</p> <p>“Oi! Shut up! Why do I feel that you’re telling a ghost story? It’s spooky!” said a soldier who was a little scared.</p> <p>The others were all speechless.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the scared one and wanted to laugh. It was the post-apocalyptic era; if ghosts existed, all the zombies could be considered as ghosts. In that case, would anyone still be afraid of ghosts?</p> <p>‘Alright, I’m that ghost. This is hilarious…’ While thinking, she quietly moved behind another soldier, then crooked her finger and knocked the back of his head hard twice.</p> <p>“Ouch!” That soldier shouted out loud and the others immediately turned to look at him.</p> <p>“Why are you yelling?”</p> <p>“Some-someone hit my head!” Once he said that, the others pointed their flashlight behind him, but saw nothing.</p> <p>“You…” the others turned back to him. That soldier looked at the others with fear, and couldn’t help but say, “There…isn’t really a ghost…is there?”</p> <p>The others stared at him silently for a few seconds, then one of them asked, “Did you lie to us just now?”</p> <p>That soldier immediately responded with discontentment, “Damn you! Why would I make that up and lie to you? Weren’t you two slapped by someone just now?”</p> <p>He looked at the two who were slapped by Lin Qiao, who nodded simultaneously. They were slapped by someone indeed! However, they both blamed each other.</p> <p>The group of soldiers fell in silence. All of a sudden, they all shone their flashlights around. After scanning the area for a few times, they found nothing.</p> <p>Then, they all became nervous, quickly gathering together and leaning against each other with their backs toward the door.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>Suddenly, the door behind them was opened. The group of soldiers were startled, and immediately turned back to look at the door.</p> <p>A man with a flashlight was standing behind the door. He shone the flashlight onto the faces of those soldiers while asking confusedly, “What are you doing?”</p> <p>“Ca-captain!” The few soldiers opened their mouth and glanced at each other, but none of them said anything more.</p> <p>What could they say? Should they tell their Captain that a ghost seemed to be in this place? If they did, their Captain might directly throw his flashlight onto their heads!</p> <p>As the group of soldiers minced their words, the Captain opened the door, walked out with confusion. Those soldiers immediately went back to their positions and straightened their bodies, looking ahead.</p> <p>The Captain looked at them curiously while walking in the corridor. He looked around, but found nothing abnormal.</p> <p>“What were they doing?” The Captain turned to the soldiers who were guarding the stairs and found that they were confusedly looking at the group of soldiers guarding by the door too.</p> <p>“What happened here?” He shouted at the soldiers by the stairs. Those soldiers shook their heads, then spread their hands. Then, one of them pointed at the ones by the doors and signaled for the Captain to ask them.</p> <p>The captain turned around and looked at the soldiers by the door confusedly as he asked, “What on earth were you doing just now?”</p> <p>They shook their heads and replied in one voice, “Nothing!”</p> <p>The Captain glanced at them again bewilderedly, then turned and went back into the room before closing the door. He had no idea that earlier on when he opened the door and walked out, an invisible figure had quietly avoided the others and flashed into the room.</p> <p>After the Captain walked back into the room and closed the door, the group of soldiers looked at each other and looked around, as if searching for something.</p> <p>The soldiers by the stairs noticed their weird behavior. “What are they doing over there?” One of them asked, “They’ve been acting strangely since earlier. I think they’re looking for something.”</p> <p>“I don’t know! But just now, I think I heard one of them shouting like he got hit.”</p> <p>“Em, I heard that too.”</p> <p>“Weirdos…”</p> <p>“Indeed!”</p>",
  "Chapter 252: Captain! Something Is Wrong!": "<p>Lin Qiao, who had sneaked into the flat, gave a start on seeing the people in the living room.</p> <p>There were quite some people in the living room, but not all of them were on the same side. Yang Jianhua wasn’t in the living room, because the window of the living room didn’t allow people to see the hotel that Lin Feng and his people were staying in.</p> <p>Hence, he was in one of the bedrooms.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to look at the bedroom. She had to move for a few steps to see Yang Jianhua, who was standing before the window, carefully observing the hotel through a telescope.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back and looked at the two groups of people in the living room. One group was under Yang Jianhua’s command, while the other few were silently sitting on the ground, all tied up.</p> <p>The five men who had their limbs tied up sat in a corner, leaning against the wall. Around them, seven or eight soldiers were pointing guns at them.<br/>\nThe five had their heads dropped, so Lin Qiao couldn’t see their faces.</p> <p>However, she felt that their scents were a little familiar, as if she had seen them somewhere before!</p> <p>Earlier on, she didn’t sense their scents so clearly from the outside. Plus, their scents were mixed together with that of Yang Jianhua’s people. But now, as she was in the living room with them, she found their scents somehow familiar.</p> <p>Since these people had been tied up, they must be Yang Jianhua’s captives. Lin Qiao considered all of Yang Jianhua’s enemies as her friends. Therefore, no matter who they were, she decided to save the five first.</p> <p>However, she was only able to bring two people into her space at one time. Therefore, to save the five men, she needed to enter and exit her space three times.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua’s guards might not be able to react after the first two people disappeared, but when the third and fourth people vanished, they would definitely make a move. So, the last person might be shot down directly.<br/>\nLin Qiao quietly avoided the others in the living room and slowly walked to the five. While wondering if she had seen them before, she tried to figure out a way to send all of them into her space in two moves.</p> <p>She wasn’t able to bring a group of people into her space in one time. And now, she found this shortcoming a little troublesome.</p> <p>The invisible Lin Qiao stood in front of the five, resting her head on a palm as she looked around while thinking.</p> <p>When Junjun carried Tong Tong, she was able to send both of them into her space at one time. So, would she be able to send all these five people into her space together if they held hands? Or, maybe she should tie them together with a rope?</p> <p>With these thoughts, Lin Qiao approached the five and glanced at their backs. Surprisingly, she found that their hands were tied up by one rope, which meant they were tied into a string.</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled, as what she was thinking had come true.</p> <p>Without hesitation, she pressed her hands on the shoulders of the two people in the middle, then entered her space.</p> <p>In the next second, the five people who were quietly sitting against the wall suddenly vanished. The seven or eight soldiers who had been staring at the gave a start simultaneously, then couldn’t help but raise a hand to rub their eyes, and look at the corner again.</p> <p>No one was there!</p> <p>“Ca-captain!” A less calm one of them shouted tremblingly.</p> <p>“What?” A level-five superpowered man responded on hearing that, automatically turned back to look at the soldier.</p> <p>“Captain! Something is wrong!”</p> <p>“Yeah, Captain, come over and see!”</p> <p>The others started talking as well, and their voices were all trembling, filled with disbelief. Hearing them, the other people in the living room all turned toward that direction. In the next instant, the few Captains immediately discovered the problem.</p> <p>They rushed over; the first Captain who responded to these few soldiers grabbed a soldier with each hand and popped his eyes to stare at the empty corner.</p> <p>“Where did they go? Where?” He growled.</p> <p>The two soldiers in his hands responded helplessly, “We…We don’t know! They suddenly…suddenly disappeared!”</p> <p>All the others on the scene fell into silence, fixing their eyes on the area where the five disappeared from.</p> <p>The Captain who went outside earlier on now wore a dark face as he said, “Did anyone sneak in?”</p> <p>The others looked at him confusedly.</p> <p>Someone sneaked in? How? There was no electricity in this flat, but they had lighting facilities. There were a few battery type lamp tubes here, so the living room was well-illuminated.</p> <p>The people in the living room weren’t blind. So, if anyone had sneaked in, how could they not see him or her?</p> <p>The Captain glanced at the others and said, “I mean, someone with a superpower, space power or invisibility.”</p> <p>At that moment, Yang Jianhua had come out of the bedroom. While handing his telescope to his assistant, he looked at the group of people and said, “Why are you yelling? What happened?”</p> <p>The group of people immediately shut their mouth and moved away to show him the empty corner.</p> <p>Seeing that, Yang Jianhua’s cold face turned even colder as he asked blandly, “Where did they go?”</p> <p>“Chief, they disappeared!” The Captain who was responsible for the captives stood out and replied.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua didn’t look at him, but continued looking at the corner. “What do you mean by disappearing? I told you to keep an eye on them, yet you let them disappear?” He said with a frosty voice.</p> <p>…</p> <p>A couple of minutes later, the five suddenly leaned backward as the wall behind their backs disappeared. When they realized what was happening, the world before their eyes had changed.</p> <p>“Damn, where is this place?” Li Zheng raised his head to find that they were no longer in that living room. He then looked at his friends, and saw that they were looking around confusedly as well.</p> <p>“Eh…The people over there, I think that’s Madam and Wenwen…”</p> <p>“And Xiaolu!”</p> <p>“Is that Great Captain’s wife?”</p> <p>They looked around and saw Lin Wenwen and the others, who were sitting on a couch. Lin Wenwen, Mrs. Lin and Cheng Wagnxue had all stood up, confusedly looking at the five men who were suddenly thrown into the grass by Lin Qiao.</p> <p>As they came closer to the five, they were shocked.</p> <p>“Eh! That’s Li Zheng, Feng Yuming, and the others!”</p> <p>“Yes, and Lei Yao, Fei Chonglin, and…Who’s that?”</p> <p>As Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen came closer and closer, Li Zheng and his people saw their faces clearly and became excited.</p> <p>“Madam! Mrs. Lin! We finally found you! And Wenwen, Xiaolu! You’re all here! Great! You’re all unharmed!”</p> <p>“Perfect!”</p> <p>The five excitedly stood up from the ground, ignoring the surrounding environment as they paid all of their attention to Mrs. Lin and the others, who were walking toward them.</p> <p>Li Zheng and his people were relatively capable and strong among all who used to be under Li Qiao’s command. Therefore, they were familiar with Lin Qiao’s family. Lin Wenwen and the others all knew Li Zheng and his people.</p> <p>The Lin Family people got close enough and found that Li Zheng and his people had their limbs tied together.</p> <p>“Eh? What happened to you? Why are you tied up? Hurry, hurry, Wenwen, Wangxue, untie them!” Mrs. Lin was surprised at first, then she asked Lin Wenwen and Cheng Wangxue to untie Li Zheng and his people.</p>",
  "Chapter 253: This Is Not Real": "<p>When Lin Wenwen and Cheng Wangxue quickly walked up to untie the five, they saw Lin Qiao standing behind the group of men.</p> <p>“Eh? Miss. Lu, where did you find them?” Asked Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao was surprised by the fact that she had actually brought all five of them into her space at one time. ‘So, I just need to tie them up together with a rope? Or, will I be able to do it as long as they’re connected physically? Will it work if they simply hold each other’s hands?’ She thought.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Wenwen’s words, Li Zheng and the others immediately turned back. As a result, they saw a bald lady in a camouflage suit standing behind them, gazing at them with glowing eyes; with one arm before her chest and the other supporting her chin.</p> <p>Seeing her eyes, Lin Zheng and his people all shivered out of fear, then automatically took two steps backward, widening their eyes on full alert.<br/>\nWithout a doubt, the pair of eyes they saw should belong to a high-level zombie. They saw a pair of zombie eyes, but their limbs were still tied, and they had zero fighting capacity at the moment.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Wenwen’s words, Lin Qiao woke up from her thoughts. The reaction made by Li Zheng and his people made her a little unhappy. “Why are you staring at me? I’m saving your asses now, yet it seems that you want to kill me with a machete. I don’t think that’s necessary!”</p> <p>Li Zheng and his people were puzzled when she talked. Subconsciously, they thought that they might be wrong.</p> <p>The bald lady might not be a zombie. Otherwise, why was she able to talk?<br/>\nHowever, on looking at her eyes, they started doubting themselves again.</p> <p>“Are you…a human?” As the Captain, Li Zheng managed to stay calm. Judging by the Lin Family people’ reaction, they didn’t seem to be afraid of the bald lady. Therefore, he cooled down and asked.</p> <p>Before Lin Qiao responded, Mrs. Lin answered his question while untying him, “Ah, you mean her? She’s not human…She’s a zombie.”</p> <p>Once Mrs. Lin said that, Li Zheng and his people all turned to look at her, their faces showing disbelief. They didn’t know if they should doubt themselves or Mrs. Lin.</p> <p>“Wait a minute…You said she’s a…what?”</p> <p>Seeing the looks in their faces, Lin Wenwen gave a smile and said, “That’s right, this bald lady isn’t a human being. As you’ve seen, she’s a talking zombie. Isn’t this magical?”</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue stood aside with Lin Xiaolu. She didn’t help to untie the five, as Wei Jingchen and Xiao Wenxing were doing it. Soon, Lin Zheng and his people were all untied.</p> <p>While stepping away from Lin Qiao, Li Zheng rubbed his numbed hands and said to Lin Wenwen confusedly, “Wenwen, you’re not joking, are you?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao crossed her arms before her chest as she looked at the five and said, “Why? Don’t you believe her? Then why did you move away from me?”</p> <p>Feng Yuming, who had paused for a while in shock, abruptly grabbed Xiao Wenxing and asked, “Brother Xiao, is what she said true?”</p> <p>Xiao Wenxing had been laughing on the inside, as Li Zheng and his people reacted exactly the same as how he and his teammates did when they first met Lin Qiao. He was glad to see other people get as confused and shocked as he was at that time.</p> <p>He laughed and responded, “Yuming, look at her eyes. Those eyes can’t be fake. No superpowered human beings have that kind of eyes. Only the eyes of zombies can look like that.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Feng Yuming was even more confused. “So, why are you…with a zombie? She…She won’t eat us, will she? A talking zombie…Oh my, so scary!”</p> <p>While speaking, he hid behind Xiao Wenxing with a crying face, who patted on his shoulder and said smilingly, “What to be afraid of? Have you seen us being nervous at all? As she said, she just saved you!”</p> <p>On the other side, Mrs. Lin suddenly joined the conversation, “What happened to you? Why were you tied up? Where were you before you were brought in?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s space was constantly illuminated, even during night time. The dim light in the space allowed the people to see things.</p> <p>Hearing Mrs. Lin’s question, Li Zheng now noticed that no lights existed in this place. “Madam, where is this place? It was all dark just now, but why is it seeming to be daytime here…?” While speaking, he had a chance to think. Abruptly, he changed his words and asked another question, “Is this a space? A space of someone with a superpower?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin smilingly nodded and replied, “You’re right. This is her space.” While speaking, Mrs. Lin pointed at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>The others gaped their mouths with surprise.</p> <p>“Such a huge space!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them with a smile while saying, “What? Aren’t you afraid of me anymore?”</p> <p>Li Zheng and his people were still on alert against Lin Qiao. But at this moment, they weren’t afraid of her anymore, maybe because the Lin Family people acted very calmly when facing her, and she looked rather friendly and nice.</p> <p>“We have no hostility against you, neither do we want to attack you,” said Lei Yao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the five men, having a familiar feeling again. She couldn’t help but ask, “Have we met somewhere before? Your scents are so familiar!”</p> <p>Hearing her words, Li Zheng and his people all thought of dogs. “We don’t know you. Maybe you’ve mixed us up with some other people,” Feng Yuming hid behind Xiao Wenxing and yelled at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>He even had doubts about his entire life right now. He was looking at a zombie, a real zombie. This zombie was able to talk and was clean, wearing clothes like his friends and himself! Moreover, the zombie had saved them! The zombie had such a huge space, and there were some other people in her space!</p> <p>And those people were just whom he and his people had been looking for!<br/>\nThis must be an illusion! Illusion!</p> <p>With these thoughts, Feng Yuming suddenly closed his eyes and murmured to himself, “It’s an illusion…It must be…I saw illusion…This isn’t real…”</p> <p>Watching him, Xiao Wenxing wanted to laugh. “Are you stupid?” He slapped Feng Yuming on the back of his head and said, “Open your eyes and see if this is real! Do you need me to give you a few punches so you can figure out if this is real or not?”</p> <p>Feng Yuming immediately shook his head to refuse, “No, no…I believe that this is real, I believe it!” He had a superpower, but regarding combat skills, he often got tortured by Xiao Wenxing.</p> <p>“Have you done catching up? If you’re done, go over there and sit down,” said Lin Qiao. While speaking, she pointed at the couch where the Lin Family people were sitting on just now.</p> <p>Then, she said to Lin Wenwen, “Wenwen, get them some water from the lake. Remember, three cups of water for them each will be enough. And, the food here is safe, so get them something to eat. I’ll go out to check the situation.”</p> <p>“Yeah,” Lin Wenwen nodded without thinking as Lin Qiao called her name.<br/>\nHaving finished talking, Lin Qiao turned and left the space while Li Zheng and his people continued to talk with the Lin Family people. Some of them still felt that they were in a dream.</p>",
  "Chapter 254: You’re Amazing": "<p>As Lin Qiao left, Li Zheng and his people finally relaxed. They still couldn’t believe what they had just seen, so they began asking questions to the Lin Family people.</p> <p>“Is she really a zombie? How can that be possible? How can a zombie talk? Besides, she looks as smart as we are! If all zombies became like her in the future, it would be horrible!”</p> <p>“She’s not like normal zombies,” said Mrs. Lin, “She doesn’t eat human beings, or hurt any.”</p> <p>There were quite some people in Lin Qiao’s space at the moment. Qiu Lili had brought in a couple of sets of couches, which were enough for these people to sit down. The only inconvenience was that these couches were a little far away from each other.</p> <p>“How did she rescue you?” Asked Cheng Wangxue, “And, why were you tied up?”</p> <p>“We met Yang Jianhua yesterday,” said Li Zheng, “He didn’t say anything to us and just captured us. Only Lin Yu escaped.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin widened her eyes with surprise and asked, “How did you encounter him? And, where’re the rest of your teammates? Only Lin Yu escaped?”</p> <p>Li Zheng’s face darkened as he nodded at Mrs. Lin, then lowered his eyes and said, “We left our base about a month ago and came here. On our journey to Sea City Base, the others died, and we’re the only one who survived. In Sea City Base, we heard that our base was destroyed, and that you managed to escape. That’s why we came out with a squad sent out by Chief Purple Thunder of Sea City Base to find you.”</p> <p>“We spent half a mouth out here, searching for you. However, instead of you, we met Yang Jianhua…And this is the result,” said Lei Yao.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen found five cups and poured the five some water. “Is this a friend from Sea City Base?” She pointed at the stranger among the five, then asked.</p> <p>That man politely nodded and replied, “Good to meet you…My name is Huang Ming!” Then, Huang Ming pointed at the few armed vehicles before the forest that the others hadn’t noticed, and asked, “Those…cars, did she bring them in here?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin and the others turned to glance at the cars, then turned back and responded carelessly, “Ah, she threw those in earlier. This is her space, so who else can put things in here?”</p> <p>Outside, Lin Qiao saw Yang Jianhua sitting on a couch with his head lowered; elbows on his knees, and fingers crossed to support his forehead.</p> <p>“Very good! There’re so many of you, yet you let someone sneak in and rescue all of them…You’re amazing!”</p> <p>The others in the living room weren’t able to see his face, but hearing his voice, they all sensed a sharp coldness rising in their hearts and bodies.<br/>\nThe air temperature in the room dropped drastically, and everyone on the scene understood that their boss was being mad.</p> <p>Suddenly, a layer of ice emerged under Yang Jianhua’s feet, then quickly reached toward the group of soldiers who were responsible for guarding Li Zheng and his people.</p> <p>The few panicked soldiers attempted to draw back, but only managed to make half a step before they were frozen from the feet to the heads. Within a blink, they turned into ice statues standing in the room.</p> <p>Seeing those ice statues, the others didn’t dare to move or even breathe. Some of them already had cold sweat oozing out of their skins.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood in an empty corner. The nighttime temperature was about ten degrees lower than the daytime temperature, so the night should be pleasantly cool. However, standing in this living room right now, Lin Qiao felt a little cold.</p> <p>At that moment, Yang Jianhua unclasped his hands and said, “The enemy is powerful, such that even I felt nothing.”</p> <p>He then stood up and slowly walked toward the ice statues.</p> <p>“But, since you can’t even guard the captives well, why would I let you live?”</p> <p>While speaking, he raised a hand to knock the nearest ice statues. In the next second, a slight cracking noise was heard from the ice statues; and soon, the noises grew louder and louder, quicker and quicker.</p> <p>Then, following a series of clattering noise, the ice statues shattered and fell into pieces, but no blood splashed out.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua’s face wore no expression, and his eyes were especially cold. He walked to the other ice statues and knocked them one after another. As he turned around, a loud wave of clattering noises was heard.</p> <p>“I was going to stimulate Lin Feng with those captives so that he and his people will panic and show some weaknesses. However, you’ve ruined my plan.”</p> <p>The others in the living room gazed at the piles of ice pieces, stunned. None of them dared to make any sound.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood behind those people and sensed some of their thoughts.</p> <p>‘So cold-blooded…’</p> <p>‘Why didn’t I know that this is Yang Jianhua’s true face before?’</p> <p>‘Damn, if you didn’t have my families, I’d never come out and hunt Great Captain for you!’</p> <p>With surprise, Lin Qiao found out that these people weren’t following Yang Jianhua willingly. It turned out that Yang Jianhua had threatened these soldiers with their families.</p> <p>Not only were those ordinary soldiers thinking that way, even the few level-five superpowered ones also had similar thoughts.</p> <p>‘Damn, why was Chief so nice to this b*stard? She was trying to protect him the whole time, yet he’s just a scum!’</p> <p>‘You trash! What are we to you? You kill our people when you want to, and you treat us like dogs.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Yang Jianhua. She honestly didn’t remember anything about him. He had hurt her, but why wasn’t she feeling anything when facing him?</p> <p>According to what Lin Qiao had learned by now, Yang Jianhua had schemed against her years ago because of Lin Wenwen. Later on, he pretended to save her, after which, he stayed around her as her life-saver. While he was pursuing Lin Wenwen, Lin Qiao built a base with her great power. As Lin Qiao’s base was established, Yang Jianhua joined hands with a man called Long something to attack her, and then forcibly occupied the base.</p> <p>He planned to kill two birds with one stone, and reap where he hadn’t sown.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua’s handsome face was now showing a cold and vicious look. The pretty face had failed to neutralize his evil vibe. If he had his pinkies up, he would look like a shemale.</p> <p>‘I wasn’t captivated by his good look before, was I?’ Lin Qiao asked herself silently.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua walked back. But instead of sitting back into the couch, he walked toward the bedroom that he was in before. His assistant followed in and handed him the telescope.</p> <p>He took over the telescope and put it before his eyes while saying, “Never mind! They’re rescued, but that’s fine. Since we can’t threaten them with the captives, we can only launch a surprise attack.”</p> <p>After taking a few glances at the hotel, he put down the telescope, then walked out of the bedroom and said to his people, “We’ll leave now…Prepare for an attack! We’re launching a night raid!”</p> <p>While speaking, he walked toward the door ahead of the others.</p> <p>As Yang Jianhua jumped into action, Lin Qiao immediately approached a level-five Captain, then reached out a hand to grab him. In the next instant, the man disappeared.</p>",
  "Chapter 255: I Don’t Want To Scare You": "<p>Lin Qiao dragged that man slightly forward, then made him disappear. Once she entered her space, she directly inserted her claw into this man’s skull and twisted her wrist.</p> <p>This man felt like he was being dragged suddenly, then his eyes were dazzled. Before he realized what happened, he suffered a sharp pain from his head, after which, he fell asleep forever.</p> <p>Just now, he was calling the few soldiers who had been turned into ice pieces by Yang Jianhua useless in his head. Because of those soldiers, his position in Yang Jianhua’s heart was lowered largely. If Yang Jianhua didn’t kill those soldiers, he would kill them himself. He had no idea that because of these thoughts he had, Lin Qiao decided to kill him first.</p> <p>Since he had had a murderous intention toward his soldiers, he would certainly push them out to hold off zombies and buy himself time in the future.</p> <p>As Lin Xiaolu was in her space, Lin Qiao chose to kill that man by the forest. In addition to that, she made the killing quick and neat, and didn’t cause any noise.</p> <p>After digging out that man’s energy nucleus, she carried the body and flashed out of her space.</p> <p>Outside, Yang Jianhua hadn’t noticed that one of his soldiers was missing. Abruptly, he heard a thud, and that made him turn back to find a body on the ground.</p> <p>He knew he hadn’t killed that man.</p> <p>“What’s this?” His face darkened immediately, and a sharp coldness began radiating from his body. Because of that, the people around him couldn’t help but draw back.</p> <p>The others all looked at him with confusion.</p> <p>“Chief…He just disappeared for a few seconds, then became like this,” someone said.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua gazed at the dead man who was lying face down. His head was cut open, but except for that, his body was intact.</p> <p>“Come out! You’ve quietly killed a level-five superpowered man within a few seconds, so I assume you’re not too afraid to show your face. Or, are you afraid of me?” Yang Jianhua raised his head and glanced around the others, then said with a frosty voice.</p> <p>“I’m afraid that I might scare you,” Lin Qiao stood behind him and said in a bland tone.</p> <p>The people in the living room immediately turned back and pointed their guns behind Yang Jianhua. They saw a bald person with a pair of sunglasses standing behind Yang Jianhua. No one knew when did she show up.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua maintained a perfect composure. He calmly turned back, then found that the person behind him was only at half a meter away. He detected Lin Qiao once her vibe emerged. He turned her head to look at her so calmly and unhurriedly because he didn’t sense any intention of killing from her.</p> <p>Of course, if Lin Qiao made a move once she showed up, Yang Jianhua would be able to sense it and dodge it.</p> <p>The first thing Yang Jianhua saw when he turned around wasn’t Lin Qiao’s bald head, but her chest. He saw a bald lady with big breasts, D-cup at least. Her waist was slim, and legs were long; she was about five feet and eight inches tall.</p> <p>He moved his eyes upward and saw her slender neck. Her skin was snow-white, seeming to be glowing with a faint white light. She had a delicate chin, and an oval-face. Even though her eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, her nose, lips, chin, and face shape still told Yang Jianhua that she was a pretty lady.</p> <p>Even her hairless head was round and cute.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Yang Jianhua with disdain because she had clearly sensed his thoughts. At the moment, he was actually rating her appearance.</p> <p>‘He’s a lecher, as I thought,’ Lin Qiao concluded.</p> <p>After measuring Lin Qiao with his eyes, Yang Jianhua abruptly gave a smile and said, “I thought I’d be scared by an ugly creature. What? Do you think you can scare me with your bald head?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t say a word to him, but slightly lowered her head and took off her sunglasses. After that, she raised her eyes to look at him.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua was curious about how her eyes looked like. However, when he saw those cold, purely black eyes of her, he was seriously startled, such that he even forgot to utter a sound.</p> <p>He paused for two seconds, then took a few steps backward as he pointed at Lin Qiao and said, “You’re not human!”</p> <p>As Yang Jianhua drew back, the others on the scene all clearly saw Lin Qiao’s weird black eyes. As same as Yang Jianhua, they all automatically stepped backward.</p> <p>Bang! Someone overreacted and shot Lin Qiao.</p> <p>When the gunshot was heard, Lin Qiao raised a hand and grasped the bullet, then spread her fingers.</p> <p>Ting!</p> <p>The bullet fell on the ceramic tile and caused a silvery sound.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t turn back to look at the soldier who shot her, but released a faint wisp of dark mist from her palm and let it drift toward the soldier.<br/>\nThen, she looked at Yang Jianhua and said, “You’re right! Don’t you know that this area is my territory? You’ve been here for quite long, and my tolerance is limited. I didn’t want to hurt you, but I think you’re aiming at my preys. That…I can’t tolerate.”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua hadn’t processed all this yet. He popped his eyes to stare at Lin Qiao as he asked with disbelief, “Are you…really a zombie!”</p> <p>He heard Lin Qiao’s words clearly. She mentioned territory and preys. So, was this area the territory of this talking zombie? By preys, did she mean Lin Feng and his people? After all, Yang Jianhua was going to attack Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>“Your preys…do you mean Lin Feng and his people?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded. While wiping her sunglasses with a corner of her shirt, she slowly lowered her head to look at the sunglasses and said, “Or whom? You? If you want to send yourself into my mouth, I won’t mind. As for the ones I’m targeting, I won’t give them to anyone else. I’ve let you stay here for so long, and I’ve shown you enough respect.”</p> <p>Suddenly, Yang Jianhua calmed down. This female zombie was so smart, and was able to talk. In addition to that, she was able to come and go like a ghost. All these meant that she was at least a zombie queen.</p> <p>She was very likely a second-grade zombie queen.</p> <p>At the moment, she hadn’t shown any hostility to Yang Jianhua, so the latter believed that he still had a chance to persuade the former to not hurt him and his people.</p> <p>He swallowed his saliva, then said, “We…I mean, we haven’t been here for long. We’ve only been here for two days, and that’s not a long time! Besides, we didn’t know that you were hunting Lin Feng and his people. Now that we know, we’ll give up for sure. You can do whatever you want! We won’t interfere!”</p> <p>He knew he might be facing a level-seven zombie, also known as a second-grade zombie queen. So, he had no choice but to throw in the sponge. He didn’t dare to overestimate himself and risk his life by challenging a second-grade zombie queen. After all, he couldn’t even win against a level-six zombie queen!</p> <p>However, he had no idea that he was fooled by Lin Qiao.</p>",
  "Chapter 256: I failed": "<p>Lin Qiao detected Yang Jianhua’s thoughts from his expression. Apart from that, she had also sensed some of his mental activity as she was pretty close to him at the moment. Based on these, Lin Qiao knew that he had believed her words completely!</p> <p>“Isn’t two days a long time? How do you define ‘a long time’ then? You don’t look like a good man. Are my preys your enemies?” She said. While speaking, she walked toward the group of man and raised her head to sniff at them while showing an expression of intoxication.</p> <p>It did smell good, the scents of living human beings.</p> <p>Seeing the look on Lin Qiao’s face, Yang Jianhua and his people surely understood her meaning: she was seeing them as food. However, no one saw the wisp of dark mist that Lin Qiao released earlier drill into the soldier’s ear, after which, the soldier froze.</p> <p>His eyes dimmed, and pupils expanded.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>People turned to the source of this noise and saw another dead body on the floor. The head of that body was disappearing.</p> <p>These people glanced at each other, then carefully turned to Lin Qiao.<br/>\nThat dead soldier had just shot her!</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said frankly, “Yeah, this man attacked me just now. For the ones who attack me, of course, I’ll eat them.”</p> <p>While speaking, she looked at those people in the eyes. As she had expected, those people lowered their heads to avoid making eye-contact, or stepped backward with fear, worrying that Lin Qiao might fix her eyes on them.</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao looked at Yang Jianhua in the eyes and said, “You haven’t answered my question yet. Do you think I have lots of time to chat with you?”</p> <p>Being stared at by her, Yang Jianhua felt a coldness from his entire body. He came back to his senses and responded, “Eh, not exactly enemies. It’s just…they betrayed our base, and escaped. To prevent them from leaking the secrets about our base, I want to bring them all back to the base or kill them.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao sneered at him and said, “You think I know nothing about the things happening out there? Those people ran all the way here from the Hades Base in the South. Many of them might have died or got injured in the journey. As for Hades Base, I know it was attacked and broken by other bases. Now, I guess it’s either destroyed or under new ownership.”</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s words, a thin layer of sweat oozed out of Yang Jianhua’s forehead. He smiled and said, “Eh, I didn’t know that you cared about this stuff. Yeah, they’re from Hades Base.”</p> <p>“They escaped, no big deal!” said Lin Qiao, “They’re just the remnants of a defeated army. Alright, you can go now. Do you need me to give you a lift?”</p> <p>When finishing her speech, she glanced at the door and slightly turned her finger. Following her move, a stream of black mist was released toward a few soldiers who were loyal to Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>“Ah…eh…” the few soldiers saw the dark mist that Lin Qiao released. However, before they could react, the thin streams of mist flew at them and disappeared before their eyes.</p> <p>After that, they all suffered a great pain from their ears and brains.</p> <p>Before long, they fell to the ground, without being able to even utter a scream. After watching these soldiers fall, the rest of the people found that the one who was killed by the dark mist earlier now only had his feet remaining; the rest of his body was gone.</p> <p>“Alright, we’ll leave now!” Yang Jianhua walked outside right away, and the others followed behind him. Lin Qiao remained standing, watching the few corpses on the ground slowly disappear.</p> <p>As Yang Jianhua left, she sighed with relief.</p> <p>‘Damn, I’ve performed a great show!’ She said to herself. She was going to get some useful information from Yang Jianhua, yet that sneaky man didn’t let her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that if she ever started a fight against Yang Jianhua, merely his ice would give her a hard time.</p> <p>With a sullen look in her eyes, she watched her dark mist cover the few piles of ice pieces. The mist had lingered on the ice pieces for quite a while, yet the ice melted very slowly.</p> <p>Right at that moment, she suddenly sensed a sharp coldness from behind her. She swiftly turned and nimbly flipped toward the wall nearby. Next, she thrust her legs against the wall and leaped onto the guardrail before the window of the living room. As she turned around, she saw that the door which Yang Jianhua and his people walked out of before was covered in a thick layer of ice. A frosty mist had been releasing from the ice.</p> <p>“You almost got me! You’re not a zombie!” Yang Jianhua’s cold voice was heard from the door. Following the voice, he walked in from behind the door. His charming eyes were filled with coldness, squinting at Lin Qiao who was by the window.</p> <p>Lin Qiao chuckled and said, “Well, I failed.”</p> <p>She leaped off the guardrail, looked at Yang Jianhua and said, “You’ve seen through me, yet you pretended to believe me. I see that you have lots of free time.”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua smiled faintly and responded, “I was just trying to find out what purpose do you have. Unexpectedly, you only wanted me to go. If you’re really a zombie, how would you let us go just like that?” While speaking, he suddenly raised an arm and swung at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>A wave of ice swords emerged from the air, flying at Lin Qiao swiftly while covering a wide area. Lin Qiao jumped out of the window, then stepped on the windowsill and climbed up to the roof.</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p> <p>Most of the ice swords stuck on the windowsill and window frame while some flew out of the window and fell to the ground.<br/>\nYang Jianhua flashed out of the window as well. As he waved a hand, an ice staircase reached up to the roof from the window. He stepped on the ice stairs, leaping toward the roof.</p> <p>It was all dark on the roof. Lin Qiao stood on a corner as she said to Yang Jianhua, “As you refuse to just leave, don’t regret.”</p> <p>Before Yang Jianhua’s ice reached under her feet through the floor, she leaped upward and disappeared. Following a series of cracking noise, the roof was frozen by Yang Jianhua. If Lin Qiao hadn’t leaped up, she would have been frozen as well.</p> <p>After Lin Qiao vanished, Yang Jianhua stood on the edge of the roof and looked around. Then, he closed his eyes to try to sense her, but detected not even a trace of her vibe.</p> <p>After opening his eyes, he suddenly moved sideways and raised an arm to release a strong wave of icy mist toward where he was standing. A hazy figure flashed across that area, leaving a large cloud of black mist that was frozen in the air.</p> <p>Crack…crack…!</p> <p>The ice which froze the mist fell to the ground and shattered into pieces.</p>",
  "Chapter 257: Great Imagination": "<p>The invisible Lin Qiao looked at Yang Jianhua from a corner and couldn’t help but sigh. Her attack was ineffective on him as he was very sensitive.<br/>\nShe had no choice but to wait and see.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Yang Jianhua was staring at the black ice pieces which were melting slowly. His ice was unexpectedly melted by the strange mist. The mist seemed to be highly corrosive. Was the zombie-eyed superpowered lady a possessor of poisonous mist?</p> <p>Defending against such kind of superpowered people wasn’t an easy thing.<br/>\nHowever, it wasn’t really difficult for Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>He glanced around, then laughed with a cold voice. “I don’t know who you are, but you seem to be on Lin Feng’s side. You’re sent here as a spearhead, which means you’ve discovered us. Lin Feng and his people aren’t going to leave the hotel, are they?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t show her face, but quietly stood beside him, looking at him.<br/>\nYang Jianhua paused slightly. As Lin Qiao didn’t show up, he continued, “I know you’re here. Weren’t you captured by the level-six zombie? There’re zombie crowds five-hundred meters away around your hotel, so you can’t leave even if you want to. Besides, I noticed that some of you have gone on a mission. I guess they were eaten one after another, weren’t they?”</p> <p>‘Eh? This man really has a great imagination! He actually thinks that way,’ Lin Qiao looked at him and wanted to laugh.</p> <p>Based on what Yang Jianhua said, Lin Qiao guessed that he did arrive here two days ago. After spending two days observing Lin Feng and his people, he found that Du Yuanxing, Yuan Xianting, and the others weren’t in the hotel. Added with the fact that he was attacked by Qiu Lili before, he actually thought that those absent people were eaten by Qiu Lili.</p> <p>The zombie crowd had blocked every entrance of the hotel, and Yang Jianhua thought that they were preventing Lin Feng and his people from getting out.</p> <p>‘So imaginative!’ Lin Qiao thought. But then, she thought from another angle and felt that it was reasonable for the people who didn’t know the truth to think that way. Qiu Lili often walked about on the roof and disappeared frequently. Indeed, she was a little like a master herder who was keeping an eye on her herd.</p> <p>‘So, this is the result of his observation from the past two days?’ Lin Qiao squatted on the guardrail while Yang Jianhua was still talking to air.<br/>\n“What? Don’t you dare to come out? I know that you’re still here. You showed up earlier, so what happened to you now?”</p> <p>Right at that moment, a soldier who was covered in wounds shambled upstairs. He got close to the group of squad leaders who were standing by the stairs and said a few words to them. Next thing, those squad leaders had their expressions changed dramatically.</p> <p>“Chief! Our vehicles are missing!” One squad leader turned to Yang Jianhua and yelled at him. Yang Jianhua immediately turned his head to look at them, sending a frosty vibe straight to their faces.</p> <p>He narrowed his eyes, then slowly approached them.</p> <p>“What did you say?”</p> <p>The group of squad leader instantly stepped aside and let the soldier face Yang Jianhua. The soldier was covered in bleeding wounds, which were caused by claws and teeth.</p> <p>He breathed quickly and weakly as he said, “We…we got knocked out suddenly…When we woke up, the vehicles were…all gone. We were…surrounded by zombies…”</p> <p>Hearing his words and seeing his wounds and pale face, the others knew that this soldier was going to die soon.</p> <p>“You were bitten by zombies,” said Yang Jianhua.</p> <p>Before the others figured out his meaning, that soldier was frozen into an ice statue.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua turned around to glance at the empty roof, then said with a dark face, “So, this was your purpose.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her brows, then quietly leaned backward and fell off the roof.</p> <p>When she returned to the hotel, Lin Feng and the other three were waiting in the room. Seeing her, they immediately stood up from their seats.<br/>\n“How’s it going? Is it really Yang Jianhua?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at them and responded, “He’s coming here soon. I’ll bring you into my space to hide, also to let you meet some people.” While speaking, she walked up and dragged Lin Feng and Lin Hao into the space. Once in, they saw a group of people sitting on couches, chatting.</p> <p>Lin Qiao left the two of them in her space, then flashed out and brought Long Qingying and Xie Dong in. After that, she saw Lin Feng and Li Zheng staring at each other.</p> <p>“Li Zheng! You…Why are you here!”</p> <p>Seeing Li Zheng, Feng Yuming, Lei Yao, and Fei Chonglin; Lin Feng could scarcely believe his eyes.</p> <p>“Great Captain! Thank God you’re okay!” Li Zheng and his people looked at Lin Feng excitedly.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin chuckled and said, “I’ve told you that we’re all fine. But your team…You’re the only ones left.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced around for a few times, but didn’t see Liu Jun and Tong Tong. She used her sensations and found that they were hiding in the small space.</p> <p>They were hiding in there the whole time, so Mrs. Lin and the others didn’t know that they were there, neither did they notice that small space.</p> <p>“Mom…why are they here?” Lin Feng asked in shock.</p> <p>“Why are you asking me?” Mrs. Lin responded smilingly, “Shouldn’t you be asking Miss. Lu about that?”</p> <p>Reminded by Mrs. Lin, Lin Feng turned back to ask Lin Qiao. However, Lin Qiao wasn’t there. He looked around and only saw Long Qingying walking toward him, as well as Xie Dong heading to the lakeside.</p> <p>“Eh? Where did she go?” He murmured.</p> <p>“Great Captain,” said Li Zheng, “Come here and sit down. I’ll tell you what happened.” Then, he pointed at Huang Ming and continued, “This is Captain Huang Ming, under the command of Deputy Chief Xiao from Sea City Base.”</p> <p>Lin Feng didn’t know that someone from Sea City Base was here, so he looked at Huang Ming with surprise. The latter smilingly waved a hand and said shyly, “Ah, just call me Huang Ming. Don’t mention the Captain thing.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded, and the look in his face turned less serious. With a faint smile, he said, “You and Li Zheng are both at level-five. It’s normal for you to be a Captain in a base. No need to be humble.”</p> <p>Afterward, some of them sat down on the couches and some remained standing.</p> <p>“We met Yang Jianhua two days ago,” said Li Zheng, “He captured us without saying anything, then brought us here. He proudly told us a lot about Chief and our base.”</p> <p>Speaking of that, Li Zheng and his people all wore a sullen look. Lin Feng could roughly guess what Yang Jianhua had said to them, and knew that he wouldn’t want to hear those words.</p> <p>“They tied us up and brought us to this area. Earlier on, at the top floor of a residential building, we were sitting against a wall and being guarded. However, someone dragged us suddenly and we got in here.”</p>",
  "Chapter 258: Walking Corpses Are Afraid Of Sunlight": "<p>Hearing him, Lin Feng could guess what had happened. It wasn’t the first time for the zombie lady to steal people away. But this time, he had to admit that the zombie lady had done a great job!</p> <p>“Yeah, they were all tied up when they first came here,” said Mrs. Lin, “We didn’t know what happened.”</p> <p>“Is Miss. Lu really a zombie?” Asked Li Zheng, “Why did she save us? She didn’t know us. You didn’t know that we were captured by Yang Jianhua, did you?”</p> <p>“Yeah, I’m curious about that too,” said Mrs. Lin.</p> <p>Lin Feng looked around and asked, “Eh, where is she? She threw us here, but where did she go?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed that they were looking for her since long ago. So, she came out of the small space, then walked over.</p> <p>“Are you looking for me?”</p> <p>The group of people turned to her and saw the bald lady wearing a pair of sunglasses. If she didn’t have such huge breasts, they wouldn’t be able to tell if she were a man or a woman.</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at where she came from and saw the entrance of the small space, getting distracted immediately.</p> <p>“Eh? You don’t have another space over there, do you?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and responded, “Yeah, what’s the problem?”</p> <p>Lin Feng had never heard about any space within another space before.<br/>\nHe shook his head, then said to Lin Qiao, “Nothing. Um…we just want to know why you decided to save Li Zheng and his people once you saw them. Do you know that they know us?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “I don’t. I just thought that Yang Jianhua’s enemies should be our friends. So, in order to make trouble for him, I saved these people. I didn’t know that you knew each other.”</p> <p>Hearing her, Lin Feng turned back to say to Li Zheng, “Do you know that Tianxing and a few others went to Sea City Base? They went to find you, also to look for some helpers. However, you were captured by Yang Jianhua.”</p> <p>“We left Sea City Base half a month ago,” said Li Zheng, “So, even if we didn’t run into Yang Jianhua the scum, Deputy Chief wouldn’t have found us.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and replied, “That’s true. But, why weren’t you in the base? What did you come out for?”</p> <p>“Ah, I’ll answer that question for them,” said Mrs. Lin, “They came out to find us. They didn’t know our route, so they went to the city nearby. They searched for half a month, but didn’t find us. Instead, they met Yang Jianhua and his troops.”</p> <p>Lin Feng sighed while saying, “Then, we have to wait for Tianxing to come back. How many people do you have in your team by now?”</p> <p>After saying that, he turned to Li Zheng again. The latter lowered his head with depression as he sighed and replied, “Except for the four of us, Lin Yu is also alive. We don’t know if he returned to Sea City Base, or if he’s surviving out here alone. When Yang Jianhua found us, he wasn’t there. He might have hidden somewhere, so Yang Jianhua didn’t see him.”</p> <p>“Lin Yu…He doesn’t have a power, does he?” Lin Feng thought for a moment, then asked with uncertainty, “I remember that you’re the only ones in your team who have powers. You had over twenty people, but now you are the only ones left.”</p> <p>“Em, that’s him,” said Li Zheng. “The others have all died. We tried our best, but there were too many zombies during the journey. We also encountered a zombie leader. The others gave up their own lives to create a chance of survival for us.”</p> <p>Li Zheng’s voice turned lower and lower, and his eyes dropped slowly.<br/>\nFeng Yuming and the other two all wore the same sad look. As the atmosphere was getting sorrowful, Lin Feng made eye-contact with the others, then hurriedly changed the topic, “Ah, I almost forgot to introduce Miss. Lu to you. Do you know who she is yet?”</p> <p>Li Zheng raised his head to look at Lin Qiao, who was standing aside and watching them. He nodded and said, “Yeah, she’s a zombie, although I don’t really believe that…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao bared her teeth toward him and asked, “Do you need me to bite you?”</p> <p>Looking at her four sharp canine teeth, Li Zheng asked her, “Aren’t you a walking corpse?”</p> <p>“What’s the difference between a zombie and a walking corpse?” asked Feng Yuming, hearing which, the others all turned to him.</p> <p>“Of course, they’re different?” Someone said.</p> <p>“How?” Feng Yuming was confused.</p> <p>“Walking corpses…Eh, well…walking corpses…”</p> <p>The group of people suddenly found it a little hard to point out the specific differences. Walking corpses carried ptomaine, so the people who got bitten by them would turn into walking dead too. On the other hand, the zombies carried the virus, so the people got bitten by them would become zombies as well. They sounded really similar…</p> <p>“Silly, walking corpses are afraid of the sun, and zombies aren’t. Zombies eat human flesh and chew human bones, but have you heard any walking corpse do the same? Eh, I mean, are you nuts? Is a walking corpse a real thing? Have you ever seen one?” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>The others couldn’t think of a word to say.</p> <p>Looking at Lin Qiao who just called him silly, Feng Yuming sneakily poked Lei Yao, who was beside him, and said with a low voice, “Why do I feel that she sounds like our Chief? If Chief were here, she’d certainly say the same to me.”</p> <p>Lei Yao glanced at him, then at Lin Qiao. He blinked, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the group of people, then continued, “You’re really into this topic. Don’t you want to know what Yang Jianhua is doing right now?”<br/>\nHearing that, the people turned to her immediately.</p> <p>“We surely do! How did he react when you brought Li Zheng and the others away?” asked Lin Feng.</p> <p>“He turned seven or eight guards into ice statues, then shattered them into ice pieces,” said Lin Qiao blandly.</p> <p>“What?” Mrs. Lin popped her eyes and said, “He killed them just like that? Those were his own people! How could he be so cruel?”</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue joined the conversation, “Mom, he’s just too good at pretending. He was never a good guy.”</p> <p>“He was planning to attack you tonight,” said Lin Qiao, “and he was going to threaten you with these few people. But, I’ve saved them and ruined his plan.” While speaking, she turned to Li Zheng and his people.</p> <p>“So despicable!” Said Mrs. Lin with a cold face.</p> <p>Cheng Wagnxue gave a sigh and said, “Alright, Mom, you’ve learned what kind of man he really is. Someone will punish that scum.”</p> <p>“He thought that you were kept in the hotel by Lili as her food, and he believes that Yuan Tianxing and the others have already been eaten,” added Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Feng and the others were surprised on hearing her, while Li Zheng and his people were confused.</p> <p>‘Who’s Lili? Does this Lili eat people? Is she a zombie too?’ Wondered Li Zheng.</p> <p>Seeing the confused look on Li Zheng’s face, Lin Hao, who had been staying silent till now, began talking, “Yes, just like what you thought. Lili is a zombie, a zombie queen, and she can eat people!”</p> <p>The others just didn’t know how to respond to that.</p>",
  "Chapter 259: Ling Ling Is Having A Fever": "<p>Lin Feng looked at her and asked, “Then what?”</p> <p>“I tried fighting him, but couldn’t win, so I came back. Let me see…” while speaking, Lin Qiao closed her eyes to sense the outside situation. She saw that Yang Jianhua was already in the hotel. He seemed to be really mad, maybe because he had found that Lin Feng and the others had all disappeared. From the first floor to the sixth floor, the hotel had been turned into a cold storage.</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened her eyes and said, “It’s very cold out there now!”</p> <p>The group of people looked at her confusedly and didn’t manage to understand her meaning immediately. It was the middle of the night, so it was surely a little cold. After the apocalypse, the nights had always been cold, and they had gotten used to that since long ago.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed their thoughts, so she shrugged and said, “I mean, Yang Jianhua froze a part of the hotel. I think he has found the solar equipment, and is preparing to take it away.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Feng slapped his thigh and said, “Ah, damn! The scum is gonna get the solar equipment.”</p> <p>Mr. Lin looked at Lin Qiao and said to her, “What? We can’t let him take the solar equipment away! Miss. Lu, can you bring the solar equipment in here?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “It’s installed on the floor, and hasn’t been dismantled. It’s connected with the roof, so I can’t get it in here, unless it’s taken apart from the building.”</p> <p>“Why don’t we let them disassemble the equipment? You can steal it after that,” said Lin Hao. Hearing that, the others puzzled at first, then turned to Lin Qiao with surprise.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave Lin Hao a thumbs-up, then said, “Smart! Even I didn’t think of that.”</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue had been looking around for quite a while, and she finally couldn’t help but ask, “I didn’t see you bring Junjun and Tong Tong in. Where are they?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her, then turned around and pointed at the small space behind her.</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu was sitting on the couch, feeling a little bored. Hearing her mother mention Tong Tong’s name, she immediately looked at Cheng Wangxue and asked, “Mom, can I go play with Tong Tong?”</p> <p>She was really bored. The conversation between those adults made her sleepy, yet her mother wouldn’t let her sleep.</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue looked at Xiaolu, then turned to Lin Qiao, who nodded and said, “Sure, it’s alright! She can sleep there if she’s tired. There’s bed.”</p> <p>When Lin Qiao’s space expanded, the small space moved to the edge. The bed didn’t move along with it, but was left outside. Later on, Junjun carried it back into the small space. Therefore, every time when Lin Qiao sent Junjun and Tong Tong into her space, she would directly put them into the small space.</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue nodded, then stood up and walked toward the small space with Lin Xiaolu.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then looked at the others and said, “I’ll go out and take a look first.”</p> <p>Then, she disappeared.</p> <p>“Is she…really a zombie? At what level? She’s so smart, and she can talk! So, is she a zombie queen?” Li Zheng asked Lin Feng.</p> <p>Lin Feng shook his head and responded, “We don’t know about her level either. But, one of her friends is a zombie queen.”</p> <p>Feng Yuming and the others immediately popped their eyes. They automatically scanned around with their eyes, then said, “Is a zombie queen here? Where?”</p> <p>They were talking about a zombie queen, a rarely seen legendary creature. Li Zheng and his people were all curious about the zombie queen. They really wanted to know what she looked like, as they had only heard about zombie kings and queens before.</p> <p>Lin Feng shook his head with a faint smile while saying, “Don’t look around. She’s not here. She went out a couple of days ago. Otherwise, Yang Jianhua wouldn’t dare to get close to us openly. If she were here, that scum might not even have the courage to approach us.”</p> <p>Hearing that the zombie queen wasn’t here, Li Zheng and his people all showed disappointment in their eyes.</p> <p>“What’s a level-six zombie like?” Asked Feng Yuming, “Does she have three heads and six arms? Is she powerful?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin smiled as she answered his question, “She doesn’t have three heads and six arms. As for if she’s powerful, well, at least, Yang Jianhua is no match for her. But, we don’t know if she can defeat a level-seven superpowered human.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen showed up with a large plate of mutant strawberries. She was going to wash them in the lake. While passing by, she said, “She’s a pretty little girl, but doesn’t like spending time with others.”</p> <p>While speaking, she walked toward the lakeside.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao had already climbed up to the roof of the hotel. She stood aside, watching Yang Jianhua and his people take down the solar equipment.</p> <p>“They actually found solar equipment…What a surprise!” Yang Jianhua said the word surprise, yet he was still wearing a sullen look.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Wu Chengyue returned to Sea City Base with his daughter and the injured Meng Yue. Once they arrived at the base, the little one started to have a fever. Wu Chengyue hurriedly sent her and Meng Yue to see the doctor.</p> <p>As Wu Yueling was the little princess of Sea City Base, the doctors nervously ran all sorts of check-ups on her. Then, a problem occurred.</p> <p>The problem was that no doctor or device was able to tell why the little princess was having a fever. At that time, Wu Yueling’s mind continued to be clear, even though she was having a fever.</p> <p>She confusedly looked at the doctors who were bustling about around her. When the doctors tried to touch her, she flinched to avoid them, then looked at Wu Chengyue with her watery eyes, wishing that her Daddy would bring her away.</p> <p>‘I don’t want to be here! Daddy…’</p> <p>As Wu Yueling was about to cry, Wu Chengyue walked to her and held her hands, then squatted by her side and said, “Good girl, let the doctors check your body. Or, you’ll get very uncomfortable.”</p> <p>Wu Yueling was shaking her head the whole time.</p> <p>‘No, no, I’m not sick! Why am I seeing the doctors?’</p> <p>Wu Chengyue touched her forehead and found that she was still burning. With concern, she asked, “Lingling, are you feeling unwell?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling shook her head again.</p> <p>“Doctor, how is she? Why is Ling Ling’s body so hot?” Wu Chengyue looked at the doctor beside him and asked. The doctor looked at Wu Yueling with confusion, then responded hesitantly, “Ling Ling is healthy. As for the cause of her fever, I’ve thought of one possibility, but I’m not sure.”</p> <p>“What cause? Why not sure?” Wu Chengyue asked anxiously.</p> <p>The doctor glanced at Wu Yueling, then turned back to Wu Chengyue and said, “It seems like her superpower is awakening. But, she’s so young, so it shouldn’t be possible for her to trigger a superpower.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and the others all looked at this doctor with surprise. Xiao Yunlong couldn’t help but ask, “What a minute, how can she possibly trigger a superpower? She doesn’t have an energy source inside her body, does she?”</p>",
  "Chapter 260: No Way To Alleviate": "<p>Hearing the words ‘energy source’, Wu Chengyue paused slightly, then glanced at his daughter.</p> <p>There was a strange energy inside his daughter’s body which he had sensed on their way back. The energy inside Ling Ling’s body seemed to have started awakening since long ago, and Wu Chengyue felt that it was growing stronger and stronger.</p> <p>Did that energy awake Ling Ling’s power in advance?</p> <p>“No! Yunlong, haven’t you sensed that the energy inside her body is getting stronger and stronger?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong walked over and held Ling Ling’s hands, then closed his eyes to sense the energy.</p> <p>“Eh? It’s true,” he said.</p> <p>The doctor frowned and continued, “It looks like Ling Ling is going to trigger her superpower. However, she’s only five, so triggering a superpower now isn’t a good thing for her.</p> <p>Reminded by the doctor, Wu Chengyue’s face darkened immediately. He felt that someone had poured a bucket of cold water on his heart.</p> <p>The doctor was right. At present, people hadn’t figured out a way to help with the fever which would manifest during the awakening of superpowers. The ones who triggered superpowers would have to get through it by themselves with their willpower.</p> <p>Generally speaking, younger people had weaker willpower than the older ones. Therefore, among the young people who had started to trigger their superpowers, the failure rate was relatively high. Only the ones with strong minds could successfully awake their superpowers.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue anxiously looked at the doctor and said, “Doctor, do you know how to stop the awakening of Ling Ling’s power? She won’t make it if she starts triggering her power now!”</p> <p>The doctor knitted his brows and said helplessly, “Currently, we don’t have any effective way to stop the awakening of superpowers. The main source of the energy which will trigger the superpower is transformed from a tiny amount of zombie virus. The virus slowly becomes the energy that can be absorbed by human body. When the energy accumulates to a certain degree, it will explode, and then trigger the superpower. Chief, you brought Ling Ling out this time. I just want to know if you’ve encountered any special situations out there?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong glanced at each other. “Ling Ling was kidnaped by a zombie king. But then, she was saved by someone else. As for what happened during that period of time, we don’t know,” said Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>The doctor pushed his glasses upward, then looked at the number showing on the screen of the device beside him. While thinking, he frowned slightly and said, “Last month, her health examination data was normal. No change should have happened to her within a year. So, I guess it’s something that happened during your journey caused the awakening of her power.”</p> <p>“So, what should we do now?” Said Xiao Yunlong anxiously, “You have to find out a way to stop it. If it continues, she’ll fall into a coma. What can we do if that happens? She’s so young! She won’t get through it!”</p> <p>The doctor raised his head to look at Xiao Yunlong, then turned to Wu Chengyue. After that, he sighed and said, “I am sorry! We don’t know how to stop it.”</p> <p>“Doctor!” Xiao Yunlong nearly lost his mind. He popped his eyes and stepped up, attempting to grab the doctor and ask him for help again. Wu Chenyue stopped him while staring at the doctor and said, “Doctor, is there really no way? We can do whatever you want!”</p> <p>The doctor was a little anxious too. “No, I mean, we really don’t know what to do. Currently, there are no results regarding how to suppress the zombie virus at all. Therefore, we can’t do anything to interfere with the super-power-awakening-process which is caused by the zombie virus after transformation.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stared straight at the doctor, looking more and more gloomy.</p> <p>He understood that the current medical research hadn’t been making any progress regarding the zombie virus. Therefore, people weren’t able to stop the ones who got bitten by zombies from turning into zombies, nor fix the awakening of superpowers.</p> <p>However, he couldn’t just give up on his daughter.</p> <p>“Doctor, just think! Is there really no way? As long as you stop the awakening of her power, Ling Ling will be safe, isn’t that right?” Xiao Yunlong said to the doctor, seeming like an ant on a hot pan.</p> <p>The doctor helplessly shook his head and said, “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry! We don’t know what to do.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue opened his mouth. He wanted to say something, but couldn’t. At that moment, Wu Yueling leaped off the bed and pulled Wu Chengyue’s trouser leg.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue lowered his head to look at Wu Yueling, then squatted and embraced her. “Ling Ling, don’t be afraid. Daddy won’t let anything happen to you!”</p> <p>Leaving the consultation room, Wu Chengyue carried Ling Ling and came downstairs with Xiao Yunlong. In the lobby of the hospital, they saw a few people coming from the outside.</p> <p>“That’s Chief Wu! He’s back!” Yang Fangyu, who had escorted Yuan Tianxing and the others to the hospital, looked at Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong with surprise.</p> <p>With a smile, she walked to Wu Chengyue and said, “Eh, isn’t this Chief Wu and our little princess? When did you come back? Why are you here? Are you feeling unwell?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was feeling depressed. However, facing the pretty lady’s warm smile, he still gave a faint smile and responded, “Deputy Chief Yan, good to see you!”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu looked at him, then turned around to point at Yuan Tianxing and the others as she said, “Great! Here, let me introduce you. This is Deputy Chief Yuan from Hades Base.”</p> <p>Then, she pointed at Wu Chengyue and said to Yuan Tianxing, who had walked to her side, “This is Chief Purple Thunder, the man you were looking for.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing reached out a hand toward Wu Chengyue and said, “Hi, I finally get to meet you in person.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue put Wu Yueling into Xiao Yuanlong’s arms, then shook hands with Yuan Tianixng and said, “Nice to meet you.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at him, then turned to Xiao Yunlong and Wu Yueling. Abruptly, he said, “Is this our little princess? She’s adorable! But, you don’t look so well. Is anything wrong?”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu nodded and said with concern, “Yeah, you look upset since we first saw you. Did you suffer a great loss out there this time?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing now looked at Wu Yueling and continued, “I guess our little princes isn’t feeling well. Her face is red. Did she catch a cold? Is she having a fever?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned to his daughter and hurriedly touched her face. He found that her face was already burning, and her face had turned red. Her bright eyes now seemed to be unfocused.</p> <p>He let out a long sigh, then said, “Ling Ling is…Her power is awakening. We don’t know how to stop it. We don’t know what to do now.”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu widened her beautiful eyes and slightly opened her mouth as she murmured, “What…! No way! She’s so young! How can that happen?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s eyes wore a sad look.</p> <p>“She’s such a little kid! How can her power suddenly awake? Did you encounter something out there?” asked Yuan Tianxing abruptly.</p> <p>He thought for a moment, then suddenly dragged Xiao Yunlong toward an empty corner while saying, “Come here.”</p> <p>In that quiet and empty corner, he turned to say to Du Yuanixng who had been ignored the whole time, “Yuanxing, give the kid some of the water in the bottle…See if it can help.”</p>",
  "Chapter 261: Miracle Potion": "<p>Hearing Yuan Tianxing’s words, the others looked at him with surprise. They were all curious about the water he had mentioned.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing quickly walked and took out a vacuum bottle from his bag, twisting off its cap and pouring some water into it. After that, he handed the cap to Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing took it over, then said to Wu Chengyue, “This water has some special effects. Let the kid drink it…see if it helps. The awakening of superpower is a big deal. I can’t guarantee if this water can help.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue took over the water and looked at Yuan Tianxing with surprise. He glanced at Yan Fangyu, then turned back to Yuan Tianxing and asked, “Deputy Chief Yuan, can this water…really slow down the awakening of her power?”</p> <p>He shouldn’t reject Yuan Tianxing’s kindness straightforwardly. However, it was the first time he had met Yuan Tianxing. Even though he believed that the other had no reason to hurt his daughter, he still needed to be careful.<br/>\nHe had heard Yuan Tianxing’s name. They never met in person before, but he knew that the latter wasn’t a bad guy.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and replied, “That I can’t guarantee. To be honest, I can’t tell the exact effects of this water. But, it’s really good for human bodies. You can choose to believe me or not.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gazed at him in the eyes. He thought for a moment, then took a sip of the water himself and sensed a coolness from the tip of his tongue. After that, he put the water near Ling Ling’s mouth without hesitation while saying, “Ling Ling, Ling Ling? Come on, have some water, here…Open your mouth.”</p> <p>He wasn’t sure if he should believe Yuan Tianxing or not. However, as long as there was a gleam of hope, he would try. He knew that Yuan Tianxing wouldn’t try to hurt his daughter, because that would do him no good.<br/>\nWu Yueling now seemed to be a little muddleheaded. She glanced at her father, then obediently opened her little mouth, waiting for Wu Chengyue to pour the water into it.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong couldn’t stop touching the little girl’s hands and forehead. “She’s getting hotter and hotter. What should we do?”</p> <p>After making Wu Yueling drink the water, Wu Chengyue gave the cap back to Yuan Tianxing, then touched the kid’s forehead as well.</p> <p>Then, his heart sank deeper.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing took over the cap and asked Du Yuanxing to refill it, then handed it back to Wu Chengyue and said, “Here, give her another cup. Normally, three cups will not work. But, she’s just a kid, so I think they will be enough for her.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at him, then gave the water to Wu Yueling without saying anything.</p> <p>At that moment, a voice was heard from beside them, “Eh? Deputy Chief, why are you standing here? Chief Wu and Deputy Chief Xiao, you’re back! Nice to see you!”</p> <p>The group of people turned around to find Lin Yu looking at them with surprise, holding a bagful of meds.</p> <p>“Ah, we were here to pick you up,” said Xiao Yunlong, “Then we met Chief Wu. We needed to talk, so we came here.”</p> <p>Lin Yu walked to beside Du Yuanxing and confusedly watched Wu Chengyue give the lid back to him. After that, Du Yuanxing filled the lid with water for the third time, then handed it back to Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu smiled and said, “I didn’t know that Mr. Yuan has such nice staff. Is this some kind of miracle potion?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing gave her a faint smile, then responded, “Kind of.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue doubtfully made his daughter drink the third cup of water, then gave it back to Du Yuanxing and said, “Thank you! If Ling Ling does get better, come to me if you need any help.”</p> <p>Lin Yu didn’t know what happened, and could only watch them confusedly.<br/>\nYuan Tianxing smiled and replied, “Sure! Chief Wu, you will be able to help us a lot. Actually, Chief, and two Deputy Chiefs, I have a favor to ask right now. Don’t tell anyone about the effect of this water.”</p> <p>“We won’t, don’t worry!” said Yan Fangyu smilingly.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded, but his eyes were fixed on his daughter.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at him and said, “You should take the kid back to get some rest, and we should leave too. I think the water won’t show its effects immediately, so be patient.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and nodded at him again as he said, “Sorry that I didn’t welcome you today. When I’m not busy, I’ll invite you to dinner.”<br/>\nYuan Tianxing carelessly shook his head and responded, “Eh, don’t mention it! I do want to help the kid.”</p> <p>After saying goodbye to each other, Yan Fangyu, Yuan Tianxing, and Du Yuanxing went back to their own places.</p> <p>After Yan Fangyu had left, Lin Yu asked Du Yuanxing, “What water did Deputy Chief give the little princess?”</p> <p>Hearing him, Du Yuanixng glanced at the medicines held in Lin Yu’s hand and said to Yuan Tianxing, “Boss, in fact, we don’t need these meds. It’s a little wasteful to trade these with food.”</p> <p>With the water in Lu Tianyu’s space, they really didn’t need these normal medicines.</p> <p>“We did it to show the others that we have enough food,” said Yuan Tianxing, “This might attract some people to work for us.”</p> <p>“Ah…” Du Yuanxing blinked and responded without fully understanding. Why did they want the others to know that they had food? What if some people decided to rob them?</p> <p>However, as long as his boss was here, no one would be able to actually rob them, unless that person was at level-six or seven.</p> <p>“You’ve had some of the water that I gave the little princess just now,” said Yuan Tianxing to Lin Yu. “Aren’t you feeling that you’re recovering too quickly? That’s our secret weapon, so don’t tell anyone.”</p> <p>“Then why did you let Wu Chengyue and the two Deputy Chiefs know?” Lin Yu asked.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing smiled and continued, “Firstly, I want to know if the water can do something to the awakening of superpowers…Secondly, if we help him this time, he’ll owe us a big favor. So in the future, there would be no unpleasantness between us if we cooperate. As for Miss. Yan, she’s not a bad person, so it’s fine for her to know.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Du Yuanxing wore an evil smile and asked, “Boss, do you have a crush on the dream girl of their whole base? Be careful, you might get murdered!”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing gave him a bland glance while saying, “What are you talking about? I have someone in my heart. But, Miss. Yan has been so friendly to me, so I can’t keep showing her a cold face, can I? Besides, she has helped us a lot. Be gentle to ladies, don’t you know that? No wonder you’ve been single the whole time!”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing looked at him, feeling a little speechless. “Like you’re not single…” he said.</p> <p>And it was Yuan Tianxing who didn’t know how to respond this time.</p> <p>Lin Yu glanced at the two of them and said, “Our Deputy Chief is so handsome and nice, so it’s normal for ladies to like him. He has always been popular among ladies.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing rubbed his jaw and said to Yuan Tianxing, “Em, you’re right! I nearly forgot that quite some women fancied you before. I just don’t understand who on earth do you like? If you like someone, you have to tell her!”</p>",
  "Chapter 262: Liang Dashu The Doctor": "<p>“It’s alright!” said Yuan Tianxing. “They don’t know that the water belongs to Lu Tianyu. If they found that the…eh-hem, that Lu Tianyu has become a zombie who’s willing to save people, things will be fun.”</p> <p>While speaking, he grinned meaningfully.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing popped his eyes as he stared at Yuan Tianxing while saying, “That’s awful! It’ll bring her troubles, won’t it?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing glanced at him and said carelessly, “Are you silly? Don’t you know what kind of a zombie she is? I guess not even a level-seven superpowered human being can get her. You think she’s as silly as you? No, she’s smart! Besides, did you forget what skills she has?”</p> <p>Lin Yu joined the conversation curiously, “I’ve been hearing you mention Lu Tianyu, zombie, and space…Are you talking about the one that I’m thinking about? She isn’t the famous Lu Tianyu in this base, is she?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and Yuan Tianxing looked at him and nodded together.</p> <p>“No way!” Said Lin Yu with disbelief, “She really became a zombie? I heard that she was knocked out and thrown into a zombie crowd. Wasn’t she torn into pieces?”</p> <p>“No, she’s fine,” Yuan Tianxing shook his head and replied.</p> <p>“She has become a zombie, that’s true!” Du Yuanxing continued, “Moreover, she won’t remind you of that Lu Tianyu who was hated by pretty much everyone in this base. She turned into a zombie who likes doing good deeds.”</p> <p>“What…?” Lin Yu was utterly confused. This sounded more and more ridiculous. ‘She became a zombie, alright,’ he thought, ‘but what does doing good deeds mean? She must be chewed by zombies when she died, so no one should be able to recognize her by now, right?’</p> <p>‘And, does that water have something to do with Lu Tianyu?’</p> <p>According to the conversation between Du Yuanting and Yuan Tianxing, it seemed that only Lu Tianyu had that water.</p> <p>However…</p> <p>“Can that water really help with the awakening of superpowers? If it turned out to be ineffective for the little princess, will Wu Chengyue have an opinion against us?”</p> <p>“What opinion can he possibly have?” Said Yuan Tianxing, “I just helped him kindly. The water might be ineffective, but it defiantly wouldn’t hurt his little princess. Besides, I’ve told him that I can’t guarantee it.”</p> <p>“Judging by how he behaved in this base, Chief Wu isn’t a narrow-minded and unreasonable man,” said Du Yuanxing, “I think he won’t blame us.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded at him.</p> <p>On the other side, Wu Chengyue brought Ling Ling back to the small building where they lived and put her in her bedroom. Then, he asked Xiao Yunlong to find another doctor. This doctor was a weirdo in the base. He barely listened to the others, and he treated the patients only when he wanted to. If he didn’t want to help a patient, no one could make him.</p> <p>However, he was always happy to help Wu Chengyue. Whenever Wu Chengyue sent his people to ask him for help, he would agree.</p> <p>This doctor’s name was Liang Dashu. He wasn’t a doctor before, but was the owner of a bookstore. He loved reading books; he read all sorts of books, especially fiction, comic books, and online novels.</p> <p>Of course, he also read lots of professional books, which he couldn’t fully understand. When he discovered something interesting in a book, he would dig deep.</p> <p>He never studied medicine; people called him doctor because of his superpower.</p> <p>He had a healing power that allowed him to easily cure some small injuries and diseases. His power wasn’t at a high level, so for serious diseases and incurable illnesses, what he could do best was to slow them down.</p> <p>Currently, he wasn’t working in a bookstore, neither as a doctor. Instead, he was a researcher in the Zombie Virus Research Institution. He had read a lot of books. With the knowledge he learned, he had purposed a series of assumptions regarding how the zombie virus was formed after the apocalypse. His assumptions were partially proven, so with Wu Chengyue’s recommendation, he became a zombie virus researcher.</p> <p>Because of his healing power, he had also learned some medical knowledge.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In a small laboratory which was filled with all sorts of complicated devices, an unshaven, long-haired man was studying and comparing all kinds of data.</p> <p>The door was knocked on twice, but the man made no response to it.</p> <p>The one who knocked on the door didn’t seem to wait for his response. Instead, she knocked the door again, then pushed it open and walked straight in.</p> <p>It was a bland-faced young lady. “Uncle Liang, Chief Wu sent someone here. He wants you to go to his place.”</p> <p>Liang Dashu didn’t move his eyes away from the data, but still replied, “Chief is back? He wants to see me, so he must be feeling unwell. Alright, I get it. Go prepare my medicine cabinet. I just need a few more minutes here.”</p> <p>The woman expressionlessly nodded, then turned and left.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In Wu Yuecheng’s small building, Xiao Yunlong touched the little one’s forehead. The girl looked tired, but she surprisingly didn’t faint.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong touched the girl’s forehead, then touched his own. After that, he said to Wu Chengyue with doubt, “Has Ling Ling’s fever stopped? She didn’t turn hotter. Her body temperature is about the same as three minutes ago.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was looking at a clinical thermometer. With concern, he said, “Em, fifty-eight degrees earlier, fifty-seven point eight now. I think her fever was brought down by a little bit.”</p> <p>Even though the fever had been brought down slightly, the number was still scary.</p> <p>“What? Fifty-eight degrees!” Xiao Yunlong popped his eyes in shock. He hurriedly turned to Wu Yueling and asked her, “Ling Ling, do you still know your Godfather? Blink if you do, will you?”</p> <p>However, Ling Ling only looked at him confusedly without making any response.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue put down the thermometer and walked over, sitting on the bedside. Then, he bent over to say to Ling Ling, “Ling Ling, can you see Daddy?”</p> <p>Ling Ling slowly moved her eyes from Xiao Yunlong’s face to Wu Chengyue’s. A trace of confusion flashed across her eyes, but she still nodded slightly.</p> <p>“Do you have any strength? Are you feeling uncomfortable?” Wu Chengyue asked.</p> <p>Ling Ling shook her head toward him, then kept shaking her head. Her movement range was small, which made her look very weak.</p> <p>“Her mind is still clear, but I guess she’s feeling weak,” said Wu Chengyue to Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>“We’ve been back for about an hour. Now, her body temperature isn’t going higher or lower. However, she didn’t fall into a coma. Is this good or bad? Her body temperature is way too high…It’s so dangerous for her!”</p> <p>“I’ve wiped her body with alcohol a few times,” said Wu Chengyue, “I don’t think her body temperature is going anywhere higher now. Let’s wait for Doctor Liang to give her a check-up.”</p> <p>“Doctor Liang has read a lot of books, and he’s focusing on the virus research now. I wonder if he knows how to help Ling Ling,” said Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>“I don’t know. I hope he can figure something out,” Wu Chengyue had hope in his eyes.</p>",
  "Chapter 263: Semi-coma": "<p>Before long, the gatekeeper informed Wu Chengyue that Doctor Liang had arrived. Wu Chengyue hurriedly walked out of the bedroom and saw two people walking into the gate while carrying a medicine cabinet.</p> <p>“Doctor Liang!” Wu Chengyue went downstairs while greeting the other.</p> <p>“Chief, does anyone need treatment?” Liang Dashu now seemed to be tidier than he was in his lab. However, his randomly tied hair and beard still made him look messy, even though he was wearing a clean white coat.</p> <p>“Doctor Liang, Miss. Moli, please come to Ling Ling’s bedroom,” Wu Chengyue looked at them and said.</p> <p>“What happened to the little princess?” Hearing that, Doctor Liang and Moli, his assistant, both looked at Wu Chengyue with surprise.</p> <p>“Ling Ling…Her power is awakening…” Wu Chengyue responded with a sullen look.</p> <p>“What! Let me see her!” The doctor and his assistant were both shocked when they heard Wu Chengyue’s words, and Liang Dashu quickly ran upstairs.</p> <p>In the bedroom, he first checked Ling Ling’s body temperature, her pupils, and tongue. After that, he gently put a hand on her forehead.</p> <p>Normally, when there were strangers, Ling Ling would have hidden herself away since long ago, not to mention letting any stranger touch her. But today, she only confusedly looked at the people in the room. Her eyes lingered longer on Wu Chengyue than on the others, but she made no response to Liang Dashu’s moves.</p> <p>Liang Dashu was surprised by how hot Ling Ling’s forehead was. He didn’t take his hand away, but kept pressing it against the little girl’s forehead. Then, a strange wave of energy was released from his palm, slowly flowing into her head.</p> <p>The other three quietly stood aside as they stared at the doctor.</p> <p>After fifteen minutes, Liang Dashu’s expression turned gloomier and gloomier. Seeing the look in his face, the others all understood what happened.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s legs were softened. He made a step backward, then turned, slowly to walk to the couch and sit down. He supported his dropped head with one hand without letting the others see his face.</p> <p>He didn’t know why Ling Ling experienced all these awful things in these two months.</p> <p>First, she was kidnapped and hidden out of the base by Lu Tianyu, and he made a great effort to finally find her. Days ago, she was taken away by a zombie queen and was nearby eaten. And now, she was back unharmed, but her power suddenly started awakening.</p> <p>If she were an adult, Wu Chengyue wouldn’t be so worried about her when she triggered her superpower. However, she was only a five-year-old child.</p> <p>Ten more minutes later, Liang Dashu reluctantly took his hand away from Ling Ling, then shook his head toward Ciao Yunlong and Moli with a serious look.</p> <p>“I can’t help her. My power won’t do anything to the energy inside her body,” said Liang Dashu upsettingly. “But, it’s weird that she’s still awake,” he looked at Wu Chengyue and continued, “Her body temperature is very high. Normally, she should have fallen into a coma long ago. Why is she still awake? Well, not exactly awake…I think she’s in a semi-coma.” While speaking, he bent over and lowered his head to carefully observe Ling Ling’s eyes.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue immediately raised his head. Looking at the doctor with bloodshot eyes, he asked, “Doctor Liang…what do you mean?”</p> <p>Liang Dashu straightened his body and crossed his arms before his chest. He thought for a moment, then said, “I feel that the awakening of Ling Ling’s power has been paused by something. It’s like someone pressed the pause button for her. The energy inside her body is temporarily trapped by something, so it can’t go back or erupt. Simply speaking, the awakening of her power is forcibly suspended!”</p> <p>Hearing his words, the other three widened their eyes with disbelief.<br/>\n“Doctor Liang, is that real!” asked Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Liang Dashu nodded and said, “Yes. I’m not sure how long this suspension will last, but it’s happening now. Normally, this won’t happen…Has anything strange about the kid happened? Or, did Ling Ling experience something not quite normal?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong glanced at each other. “Ling Ling has had some water,” said Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Once he said that, Ling Dashu immediately turned to him and asked, “What water? Where did she have it? Where is the water from? How could you make her drink unsafe water? What if it delivered the opposite effects?”</p> <p>“Who gave us the water said that it’s good for the kid,” said Wu Chengyue, “He has no reason to hurt Ling Ling. Besides, I took a sip myself first. I gave it to Ling Ling because I felt nothing wrong after drinking it.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong abruptly raised a hand and said, “Wait a minute, is Ling Ling’s current situation good or bad? Doctor Liang, I don’t quite understand what you said. She’s not in danger right now, is she?”</p> <p>“Didn’t I say that the awakening of her power has been suspended for some unknown reason? She’s safe for now, but I don’t know how long this situation can last. She hasn’t passed the crisis, so we should keep her under observation. Do you understand now?” Said the doctor.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong nodded and responded, “I see. So, Yuan Tianxing’s water worked? If we find him and get Ling Ling more of that water, will her situation turn better?” While speaking, he turned and walked outside. “I’m going to find them now.”.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at him, but didn’t stop him, only turning to look at Ling Ling. If this were really because of Yuan Tianxing’s water, Wu Chengyue would have no choice but to keep asking him for help.</p> <p>“Wait, I’m going with you!” Liang Dashu abruptly said out loud, then immediately followed Xiao Yunlong out.</p> <p>The expressionless Moli stayed in the room as she looked at Wu Chengyue and then at Ling Ling. She walked to the bed and bent over to touch Ling Ling’s forehead, then slightly frowned.</p> <p>“Her body temperature is so high, yet she’s only in a semi-coma. How amazing!”</p> <p>Wu Yueling’s clothes had been taken off by her father, because her body temperature was too high. At the moment, she was only covered in a sheet, with her hands and feet exposed in the air.</p> <p>Moli pressed her hand on Ling Ling’s forehead for a few seconds, then took her hand away.</p> <p>“Ling Ling’s mental state is stable, and no unusual change has happened. So, for now, she won’t suffer any mental breakdown. So amazing! What’s that water?”</p> <p>While speaking, she looked at Wu Chengyue. Her face still wore no expression, but her eyes showed some curiosity.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stood up and walked to the bedside. While gently stroking Ling Ling’s long hair, he shook his head and said, “I don’t know! I just gave it to Ling Ling and hoped that it’d help.”</p>",
  "Chapter 264: This One Is A Little Silly": "<p>Moli looked at him and said, “Chief, you’re so careless that you even made the kid drink an unidentified liquid given by some other people. Have you thought about the consequences?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue sighed and responded, “What else could I do? The awakening of a superpower is life-threatening for anyone. To save Ling Ling, I have to think of it as a cure, even if it might be a poison. What if it’s really helpful? You see, hasn’t a good result shown up?”</p> <p>Moli nodded, “You’re right! Having hope is better than being hopeless and unable to do anything.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and Du Yuanxing were in their room, reading the files of the applicants. Many people were attracted by the good deal of food that Yuan Tianxing offered, but most of them gave up on hearing that they would be heading to a zombie city.</p> <p>After all, zombie cities were all forbidden areas. Ordinary people who managed to go to a zombie city and come back alive would be considered really lucky. Even for level three and four superpowered human beings, the chance of survival in a zombie city would be very small.</p> <p>Therefore, ninety-nine percent of applicants gave up, and the rest were either starving, or had no other choice.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing repeatedly emphasized that he and his people would guarantee that no zombie attack would happen. However, they didn’t ensure the applicants’ life safety.</p> <p>Since their mission was published, only three people decided to work for them.</p> <p>“Boss, this one is a level-four with earth power, same as you. I think he’s good.”</p> <p>“Ah, him…I’ve sent someone to check his background. He has a level-four superpower indeed, but he’s a little silly. Every time he went out for a mission with the others, he came back covered in wounds. However, the food he earned is always the least among all. And, he eats like a horse. The food he earned can never last more than three days. The food that can last anyone else for a week, he’ll finish within two days.”</p> <p>“No way! That’s…The others are all trying to save as much as they can, so why does he eat so much?”</p> <p>“That’s why I said he’s a little silly. He just doesn’t know that he should save food. He’s quite famous now. Because he isn’t smart enough, people think that he might become a burden during a mission, so many teams refused him.”</p> <p>“That can be possible though. After all, there’re too many dangers outside. Should we accept him? He won’t cause us any trouble, will he?”<br/>\nYuan Tianxing sighed and responded, “For now, we have too few people that can lead the charge, so we have to accept him. He might be a little dim-witted, but I think he’ll be fine as long as we pay more attention to him.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing nodded. They were too short-handed at the moment, so they couldn’t be picky.</p> <p>At that moment, Lu Junjie, who guarded by the door, abruptly knocked on the door and reported, “Boss, Deputy Chief Xiao is here.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing paused for a second, then turned to look at the door while saying, “Chief Xiao? Ah, let him in.”</p> <p>Lu Junjie immediately opened the door, then stepped aside and made a sweeping motion toward the people outside. Please come in,” he said.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong walked in, and a bearded man followed behind him.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing pointed at the couch and said politely, “Please take a seat. Is this about Ling Ling? What happened?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong pointed at Liang Dashu who was behind him while saying, “This is Doctor Liang from our base. We’re here for that water of yours.” After saying that, he sat on the couch.</p> <p>Lu Junjie closed the door after they walked in.</p> <p>Hearing Xiao Yunlong’s words, Yuan Tianxing nodded at Doctor Liang and greeted him, “Good to see you, Doctor Liang!”</p> <p>“Good to see you too,” Liang Dashu nodded at him as well. Then, Xiao Yunlong pointed at Yuan Tainxing and said to Liang Dashu, “This is Deputy Yuan from Hades Base.”</p> <p>“Mr. Yuan,” said Liang Dashu, “Can you please show us the water that you brought?”</p> <p>Hearing Liang Dashu’s question, Yuan Tianxing’s face darkened slightly. Then, he turned to Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Earlier, he had mentioned that he didn’t want anyone else to know about the water. But now, this Doctor Liang showed up.</p> <p>Seeing the look on his face, Xiao Yunlong understood his meaning. So, he hurriedly explained, “Ah, please don’t worry. Doctor Liang is different from the other doctors. He won’t tell the others about this. And, he’s a solitary person. He rarely contacts with the others, so you really don’t need to worry.”</p> <p>Liang Dashu knew what they both meant. So, he nodded at Yuan Tianxing and said, “I promise, except for my assistant and me, no one will know about this.”</p> <p>“Ling Ling’s current situation is a little special,” said Xiao Yunlong, “Doctor Liang and we all think that it might be caused by the water you gave us. So, we came here to talk to you.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing glanced at Liang Dashu with a serious look, then said to Xiao Yunlong, “How’s Ling Ling now?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong glanced at Liang Dashu.</p> <p>“Her situation is quite special,” said Liang Dashu, “The awakening of her power seems to be suspended by something. It has paused now. She’s still having a high fever, but she hasn’t fallen in a coma yet. I’m not sure if this is temporary, or if she’ll keep being like this. And we don’t know if her power will continue to awaken or stop.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing widened his eyes with surprise, then glanced at Du Yuanxing, who was behind him. After that, he turned back and said to Xiao Yunlong and Liang Dashu, “Suspended? Really?”</p> <p>The two nodded. “It’s the first time for such kind of situation to happen, so we don’t know what’ll happen next,” said Liang Dashu, “So, we want to know if some kind of special elements exist in that water, or some other thing that suspended the awakening of Ling Ling’s power.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing gave Du Yuanxing a hand sign, then asked, “How long has Ling Ling’s situation lasted? When did it start to change?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing poured a cup of the water from Lin Qiao’s space, then put it on the tea table before Liang Dashu and Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Liang Dashu impatiently took the water over and put it near his eyes as he looked at it carefully. At the same time, he answered Yuan Tianxing’s questions, “She was like that when I arrived. She has her eyes opened now, but her mind isn’t clear.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong had also been curiously looking at the cup of water in Liang Dashu’s hands. It was transparent water that looked nothing special. “About half an hour ago,” he said, “Her body temperature stopped rising at fifty-eight degrees. Before Doctor Liang arrived, her body temperature dropped a little bit.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing crossed his arms before his chest and said while thinking, “Fifty-eight degrees, that’s a normal body temperature during the awakening of superpowers. Sometimes, it’ll even reach seventy degrees. Normally, people would lapse into unconsciousness with such a high fever, but Ling Ling is still awake. It’s really a miracle!”</p> <p>“Yeah,” said Xiao Yunlong, “So we came to you. We want to give Ling Ling more of this water, to see if we can stop the awakening of her power for good.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and said, “That won’t happen. Its effects are limited. Drinking more of it won’t heighten its effects.”</p>",
  "Chapter 265: Dragonfly Is Important": "<p>Liang Dashu spent a while staring at the water in the cup, then sniffed at it and took a sip. Then, he turned to say to Yuan Tianxing, “The water does contain a special type of energy. I feel that it shares the same origin as my power, and also has a healing effect. But, the energy contained in the water is not exactly the same as my power…There is more to it. Mr. Yuan is right. The effects of this power are limited.”</p> <p>He sighed, then put the cup on the table.</p> <p>“In fact, it depends on how much energy the people who drank it can absorb. After reaching a saturation, human bodies won’t be able to absorb any more of the energy in this water, and the extra energy would be excreted, or simply fade away,” he continued.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong looked at him, slowly showed a look of disappointment.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “That’s right! But, the effects of the water have just started showing up. We need to wait and see. Can I go to Chief Wu’s place?”</p> <p>“Of course!” Xiao Yunlong immediately nodded.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stayed at the bedside, looking at Ling Ling. Moli took out the clinical thermometer and checked the number on it, then said, “Her body temperature dropped again! It’s fifty-seven point one degrees now.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue touched Ling Ling’s forehead. Feeling her hot skin, he said, “But her mind isn’t clear.”</p> <p>Moli still wore no expression as she responded, “Chief, her body temperature has dropped a little. As long as it doesn’t keep rising, Ling Ling’s condition might take a turn for the better. Even staying in a semi-coma is better than her power continuing to awaken. Cheer up, Doctor Liang may figure out a way to help Ling Ling.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue understood that she was trying to comfort him, and also knew that Ling Ling’s current situation was already not bad. It had been quite long since her power started to awaken. If this magical suspension didn’t happen, she would have fallen into unconsciousness long ago, and no one would know if she would ever wake up.</p> <p>Right now, Wu Chengyue was very scared. He was worried that Ling Ling’s situation might change again. If the energy inside her body continued erupting to trigger her power, she would have no chance of survival.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue sat on the chair beside the bed, holding Ling Ling’s little hand with one hand and brushing her bang with another.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, look at Daddy. Are you hungry? Would you like to eat anything?” He talked to Ling Ling and tried to wake her up with his voice.<br/>\nThe little one glanced at him confusedly without nodding or shaking her head. Then, she turned her large eyes to the ceiling, and those eyes were unfocused.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned his head to see the grass dragonfly that she had put on the table. He paused for a second, then picked it up.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, look, the dragonfly you like. If you don’t get us, Daddy will hide it,” he dangled the dragonfly before Ling Ling’s eyes, then made a joke.<br/>\nHe didn’t expect Ling Ling to make any response, but to his surprise, the little girl moved her eyes to the grass dragonfly from the ceiling.</p> <p>Seeing that, Wu Chengyue gave a start at first, then looked at her with surprise while saying, “Ling Ling, do you recognize this?”</p> <p>Ling Ling gazed at the grass dragonfly without giving any response.<br/>\nWu Chengyue moved the grass dragonfly. As he expected, Ling Ling’s eyes moved along with it.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, do you want this?” He asked, “If you do, just nod. Then Daddy will give it to you, alright?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue wanted to know if Ling Ling’s brain would receive his words.<br/>\nLing Ling didn’t nod as he wished, but kept staring at the grass dragonfly in his hand.</p> <p>Moli, who stood aside, was surprised, even though she didn’t show a surprised look. “This grass dragonfly must be really important to Ling Ling, or she wouldn’t be able to recognize it. After all, her mind isn’t clear at the moment.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue put the grass dragonfly on Ling Ling’s hand and said, “She loves it. She has been seeing it as her treasure all the time.”</p> <p>Soon, Xiao Yunlong returned with Liang Dashu and Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>“How’s Ling Ling doing? Is she getting any better?” They asked about Ling Ling’s condition the moment they entered the room.</p> <p>“Good to see you, Chief Wu. Sorry for coming without an invitation. I hope you don’t mind,” Yuan Tianxng greeted Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>To be polite, Yuan Tianxing only brought Du Yuanxing into the room, and left the others outside.</p> <p>Seeing him, Wu Chengyue immediately stood up and said, “It’s alright! I haven’t thanked you yet. Your water seems to have helped Ling Ling. I just want to ask you for more help.”</p> <p>“Can I see Ling Ling now? To be honest, I’m not so sure about the effects of that water. It’ll be wonderful if it’s really helpful,” said Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>“Yeah,” responded Wu Chengyue, “But, Ling Ling’s current condition might be…”</p> <p>“Thank you,” Yuan Tianxing nodded. While speaking, he walked to the bedside with curiosity and saw that Doctor Liang checking Ling Ling’s pulse and pupils.</p> <p>“How is she?” He asked. Doctor Liang was looking at Ling Ling’s hand which was clutching the grass dragonfly. He found that once he tried to touch the grass dragonfly, the look in Ling Ling’s eyes would change a little.</p> <p>He took a step backward, then said, “Her body temperature has dropped a lot since we left. However, she’s still in a semi-coma. She seems to care a lot about this little thing in her hand. Where did this from?”</p> <p>“Ah, it’s from a…Eh, someone gave it to her,” said Xiao Yunlong, “Ling Ling does love it. Normally, she won’t let go of her hold on it.”</p> <p>Doctor Liang thought for a moment, then continued, “I can’t see any obvious change now, but based on the fact that her body temperature is dropping slowly, she’s getting better. The problem now is that if she can wake up completely. Judging by the reaction she made for this little toy, she cared a lot about it. But, that’s only a subliminal reaction.”</p> <p>Hearing the doctor’s words, Wu Chengyue didn’t relax his tightened face, but he didn’t look as upset as he was before at least.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong looked at the doctor and asked anxiously, “What you do mean? Should we keep observing her?”</p> <p>Doctor Liang nodded in response.</p> <p>On the other side, in Ling Qiao’s space…</p> <p>Lin Qiao wasn’t in there, and some of the others were still sitting on the couches. However, a few energetic ones just couldn’t keep sitting.</p> <p>Ling Wenwen picked some strawberries, then washed them in a bucket by the lakeside. She saw two large buckets by the other side of the lake, but didn’t dare to go near that area because she found that two living zombies were soaking in the buckets!</p> <p>After washing the strawberries, she went back to the couch area. Putting the strawberries on the table, she said, “These are from Miss. Lu’s space. Eat, they’re safe.”</p> <p>While speaking, she picked one and began eating.</p> <p>She and the others had had some of these strawberries before, so they didn’t worry that they might turn them into zombies.</p>",
  "Chapter 266: Recycle Solar Energy": "<p>Unlike Lin Family people, Li Zheng and the others stared at those strawberries in surprise without touching them. Feng Yuming, who had already relaxed, noticed the two large buckets tens of meters away. He pointed at them curiously and asked, “Eh? Are people sitting in the two buckets? I think two people are sitting in them. What are they doing?”</p> <p>“Ah, those aren’t people. Those are zombies. I think we should all stay away from that area,” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“Zom-zombie? Eh? There’re other zombies here?” Feng Yuming asked, horrified.</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and said, “You think the bald lady is the only zombie? She’s just the head of the zombie squad.”</p> <p>Li Zheng asked confusedly, “What a minute, Great Captain! Who is the zombie squad?”</p> <p>Lin Feng smiled and responded, “Um, why do you think we can stay in this area safely? That’s all because we have some special allies.”</p> <p>“Oh! Also, I want to know how you escaped from Yang Jianhua,” Li Zheng asked another question.</p> <p>Lin Feng told him and his teammates about what happened, then said, “So now, we’re staying here temporarily, waiting for Yuan Tianxing and the others. We just didn’t think that Yang Jianhua would have the guts to come back. He’s smart though. He observed us from far away and waited until Qiu Lili wasn’t here to launch a sneak attack.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Outside, Lin Qiao watched Yang Jianhua’s people remove the solar equipment from the building. The solar panel, storage battery, controller, inverter, and other parts were placed aside, waiting to be carried downstairs.</p> <p>As those people prepared to bring the equipment downstairs, Lin Qiao made her move.</p> <p>“Be careful, don’t break it!” Yang Jianhua said to his people loudly.<br/>\nLin Qiao went downstairs ahead of them and waited before the stairs for them to come down.</p> <p>When a man came down, she first collected the things that he carried, then knocked him out and threw him aside. Then, she waited for the next one.<br/>\nAs the solar equipment contained many parts, Yang Jianhua had arranged about twenty people to carry them down.</p> <p>When Ling Qiao knocked out the third man, she was caught.</p> <p>“Someone is stealing the solar equipment!”</p> <p>Hearing this shout, Lin Qiao moved quicker. She swiftly flashed across those people and touched the components in their hands, then knocked them on the heads.</p> <p>By the time Yang Jianhua heard the noise and ran downstairs, he saw a group of people lying on stairs, and the components they carried were all gone. Then, he remembered that some other components were still on the roof, so he rushed back up. However, when he got there, nothing was left.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao suddenly showed up from a corner which was far away from him and gave him a cold smile as she said, “The solar equipment belongs to us. Thank you for disassembling it.”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua’s face was extremely dark now. His handsome face was even a little twisted as he said through gritted teeth, “You’re still here!”</p> <p>Ling Qiao shrugged and said, “Why can’t I be here? This is my territory. Stay here if you dare. I’ll welcome you.”</p> <p>She was never worried that Yang Jianhua would go too far, because she had noticed that no one among his people had space power. Therefore, he needed to transport everything manually, and his vehicles were stolen by Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Even if he didn’t need to carry the solar equipment, he still wouldn’t be able to go too far too soon.</p> <p>“You don’t even have a space-powered person around you,” Lin Qiao continued, “As a leader, you’re such a failure.”</p> <p>Hearing her, Yang Jianhua’s face turned even darker. It was late at night, so no one noticed his dark face. However, his vibe had turned very dark as well. Wave after wave, the depressing vibe radiated from his body. “Whether I’m a failure or not, that’s not for you to say. Stop hiding and fight me face to face if you can!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao laughed on hearing his words. “I don’t like what you said,” she said, “If I could, why would I be hiding? I can’t defeat you, that’s true. But, I didn’t offend you. You offended me! If I could beat you up, I would have disabled you!”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua just couldn’t think of a word to say. She was right! He came here to bring troubles to Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>“They’re just a bunch of homeless dogs,” he snorted and said, “Sooner or later, I’ll kill them all. I guess they’re in your space, right?” Based on what happened before, he had figured out that Lin Qiao had space power. As for the dark mist, he didn’t know that it was her other superpower. Instead, he thought that was just some kind of poisonous mist that she had collected.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s face suddenly turned cold. She stared at Yang Jianhua quietly with a pair of dark eyes which glistened with a strange light while saying, “You won’t have a chance. You aren’t powerful enough. For what you did to Lin Qiao, you’ll pay with your life one day.”</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s name, Yang Jianhua paused for a second. Then, the dark look in his face disappeared, being replaced by a proud grin. “Ah, so you know Lin Qiao,” he said, “You’re not trying to avenge her, are you? Before you do that, I think you should collect her body first.”</p> <p>A gleam of light flashed across Lin Qiao’s eyes as she said, “So, you did trap her in a zombie city and pretend to save her, then got close to her as her life-saver? All this real?”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua nodded and replied, “Yes. Don’t the Lin Family people know that? Do you still need me to confirm it? Don’t bother. I entrapped her, so what? What can you do to me?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao suddenly burst in laughter, sounding a little weird. “For what you just said, please live longer. Don’t die too soon, or I’ll really feel sorry,” she said.</p> <p>She had decided to kill Yang Jianhua after finding back her memories. If she killed him before remembering anything about him, his death might become meaningless. Perhaps, when she finally remembered everything, she might even feel that killing him was just not enough.</p> <p>If he did do what he said, she wouldn’t let him die without suffering.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua sneered coldly and carelessly while saying, “You want me to die? Well, let’s see if you have the ability to kill me.”</p> <p>“Hehe,” Lin Qiao gave a snort and replied, “Even if I have the ability now, I won’t kill you.”</p> <p>“What do you mean?” Yang Jianhua didn’t quite understand, so he asked confusedly, “Will you show mercy to me?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao laughed grimly and responded, “I just don’t want you to die like this. You’re overthinking it.”</p> <p>After saying that, she turned and entered her space without saying anything else.</p>",
  "Chapter 267: Timid": "<p>After entering her space, Lin Qiao showed up next to the pile of solar equipment parts. The others had already gathered in that area. At the moment, they were talking about how to put these parts back together.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over and asked, “Can anyone assemble it?”</p> <p>Hearing her voice, the others all turned to her.</p> <p>Lin Feng shook his head and said, “None of us can do it. Li Zheng, you and your people don’t know how to install it either, do you?” While speaking, he turned to Li Zheng and his teammates who were standing in front of him.</p> <p>Li Zheng shook his head and replied, “Nope. I think we should wait for Deputy Yuan to bring some help back.”</p> <p>Li Qiao abruptly turned to Li Zheng and his people as he said, “Why do I feel that I’ve seen you somewhere before? Your scents are familiar to me as well.” While speaking, he leaned toward them to sniff.</p> <p>“Yee…” Seeing that, Li Zheng and his people automatically stepped back. Feng Yuming hurriedly waved his hands and said to her, “No, no! We never met before. At least, I’ve never seen you.”</p> <p>Looking at Lin Qiao’s shiny bald head and scary dark eyes, he couldn’t help but shiver out of fear.</p> <p>Lin Qiao approached him and said wickedly, “Why are you so afraid of me? Do you fear that I might eat you? Don’t worry, I don’t eat lazy boys.”</p> <p>As she came close to him, Feng Yuming was truly frightened. However, he felt that she was just teasing him.</p> <p>“You… You… Stay away from me!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao moved backward smilingly, then carefully looked at Li Zheng and his people up and down. While thinking, she said, “I really feel that I’ve seen you somewhere before. How strange!”</p> <p>Li Zheng shook his head and smiled at her as he responded, “I’m not sure why you feel that way. But, I haven’t seen you before.” While speaking, he turned to Fei Chonglin, Lei Yao, and Huang Ming.</p> <p>Few Chonglin and Lei Yao shook their heads together, as they had never seen Lin Qiao before she saved them either. Unlike them, Huang Ming fixed his eyes on Lin Qiao’s face with confusion, seeming to be struggling.</p> <p>“You look familiar to me too. Are you from Sea City Base?” He asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him. There was a distance between the two of them, so she couldn’t sense his thoughts. However, the look in his eyes told her that he had thought of something.</p> <p>“You mean before I became a zombie? Yes,” she responded.</p> <p>Huang Ming looked at her face and said, “I feel that I’ve seen you before, but I can’t remember where and when. May I ask your name?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him and replied with a meaningful tone, “I think you better not know my real name.”</p> <p>She knew that Huang Ming wasn’t from the Hades Base, meaning that he wasn’t one of Li Zheng’s team members. He was from Sea City Base, and Lin Qiao guessed that all Sea City Base people had some impression of her face.</p> <p>She looked drastically different now compared to before, as she wasn’t wearing any makeup, was bald, and had zombie eyes. However, Huang Ming still recognized her a little.</p> <p>“Why not? Isn’t your name Lu…” Lin Hao, who stood aside, suddenly began saying her name out loud.</p> <p>“Ahyayayahoho… Shut up!” Lin Qiao uttered a series of weird sounds to interrupt him, then sourly glanced at him.</p> <p><em>‘Because you’re not from Sea City Base </em>!’ She wanted to shout at Lin Hao. After glancing at him, she asked Li Zheng another question, “Were you all under Chief Netherworld Fire’s command before?”</p> <p>She had learned that she had a title and identity which were completely strange to her, and saying those out loud made her feel weird.</p> <p>Li Zheng nodded while asking, “Yeah, why?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin and Lin Feng were also looking at Lin Qiao; both of them had been making some guesses.</p> <p>Lin Qiao noticed the gazes from Mrs. Lin and Lin Feng, so she didn’t continue the topic. “Ah, nothing, I’m just curious.”</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Wenwen abruptly came close to her and pointed at the two zombies which were quietly sitting in the two large buckets while asked, “Those two are zombies, are they? What did you do to them?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to that area and found that Lin Wenwen was talking about Qiu Lili’s two underlings.</p> <p>“Nothing… I just want them to bathe for a few days,” she said.</p> <p>While speaking, she walked to the two zombies. She found that the energy in the water inside the buckets was nearly drained, and the two zombies were facing the group of living human beings while staring at them.</p> <p>For some reason, she wanted to laugh. Why did the two zombies look more and more like two large dogs?</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying followed her over curiously. Behind them were Lin Hao and Feng Yuming. Feng Yuming didn’t want to come, but ended up being dragged over by Lin Hao. The four of them followed Lin Qiao while maintaining a distance of two meters behind her, trying to figure out what she was doing.</p> <p>As they got close enough, they found that the two zombies were hungrily gazing at them with wide-open, creepy-looking black eyes.</p> <p>“Oh my! They won’t jump out of the buckets to eat us, will they?” Feng Yuming was startled.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them and said, “Come here… Stand right in front of them and see if they’ll jump out.”</p> <p><em>‘Why is this kid so timid? </em>‘ She wondered.</p> <p>Feng Yuming quickly shook his head. If Lin Hao hadn’t been grabbing his arm tightly, he would have sneaked back long ago.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen took a small step forward, curiously looked at the two zombies in the buckets while asking, “What are you doing?”</p> <p>It was the first time for her to see such quiet zombies. Their faces had been washed clean, but their pale skin, deeply sunken eye sockets, dark circles under their eyes, sharp teeth, and black eyes still made them look terribly scary.</p> <p>“Transform,” Lin Qiao only said one word.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao come close, the two zombies both uttered deep growls toward her. Lin Qiao glanced at the water in the female zombie’s bucket, then said to her with a cold face, “You see, you’ve drunk so much of the water in your bucket. Why aren’t you stuffed to death?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little speechless, as the water in the female zombie’s bucket was now only waist-deep.</p> <p>“Roar…” the female zombie gave her an unconfident roar, then was attracted by the scents of Lin Wenwen and the others again.</p> <p><em>‘They smell so nice… I want to eat them so badly… I’m so hungry!’</em></p> <p>Lin Wenwen turned to Lin Wenwen and the others and said to them, “Your scents are tempting these two zombies.”</p> <p>Once she said that, Feng Yuming freed himself from Lin Hao’s grip and turned to run away fleetingly.</p> <p>“Oh? Why’re you running? Damn, are you even a man? How can you be such a chicken!” Lin Hao shouted at his back.</p> <p>“I am a man! But, no one said that men can’t be afraid of zombie!” Feng Yuming shouted back from a distance away.</p> <p>Lin Hao pointed at Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying, then continued, “Look, even the girls aren’t frightened! What the hell are you afraid of!”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying were curious about why the two zombies sat motionlessly in the two buckets. The two zombies were alive, and the look in their eyes clearly showed that they wanted to bite the group of human beings very much. However, they didn’t make a single move.</p> <p>Were they tied up?</p>",
  "Chapter 268: Scary Power": "<p>“If you come a little closer, these two will spring up,” said Lin Qiao as she felt that the two zombies were already preparing to make a move. Lin Wenwen took a step back and said confusedly, “Are you trying to change their constitutions by soaking them in the water? Can zombies’ constitution be changed?”</p> <p>“Why not?” said Lin Qiao, “Didn’t I change?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen didn’t know what else to say.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then turned to say to the two zombies, “Get out! Stand aside, and don’t move!”</p> <p>The two zombies obediently got out of the buckets, exposing their naked bodies in front of the group of human beings. The zombies didn’t care, but Lin Wenwen and the others turned their eyes slightly away. But soon, they turned back to carefully observe the bodies of the two zombies, and began giving comments.</p> <p>“This female zombie has a pretty good body shape. Looks, b*obs, slim waist, long and straight legs…”</p> <p>“… Yeah!” Long Qingying responded.</p> <p>“The male zombie is not bad either. I wonder if he can still get erect after becoming a zombie,” Lin Wenwen continued.</p> <p>“Eh-hem…” Long Qingying didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>“Oi,” Lin Hao joined the conversation, “You’re a girl! Can you stop staring at a male creature’s private parts and talking about if he can get erect or not?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen turned to find a group of men beside Lin Hao all staring at her and Long Qingying with a weird look.</p> <p>Long Qingying turned her face away with a slightly embarrassed look. She looked at Lin Qiao and saw the latter drag the two large buckets to the grassland. She poured the water into the grass, then dragged the buckets to the lakeside.</p> <p>After refilling the two buckets, she easily dragged them back to the two zombies.</p> <p>“Get in, sit tight,” she said.</p> <p>Watching the two zombies obediently sit inside the two buckets, Lin Qiao abruptly reached out a hand and pressed on the female zombie’s head while saying, “Don’t drink it! If you drink it, I’ll kill you!”</p> <p>“Roar…” The female zombie gave her an unhappy roar, but didn’t dare to drink the water. Instead, she stared straight at the group of living human beings. Lin Hao, Li Zheng, and the others were curiously watching the two zombies at the moment.</p> <p>“What is she doing?” Li Zheng asked, “These two zombies seem to be at level three or four, but they’re as obedient as puppies in front of her. What level is she at?”</p> <p>Lin Hao shook his head and replied, “We don’t know that. I guess she’s at level-six.”</p> <p>“Level-six?” Li Zheng asked with surprise, “So, she’s a zombie queen? Can zombie kings and queens evolve to such a high grade now!”</p> <p>Lin Feng walked over from behind while saying, “That’s not for sure. I’ve only met two talking zombies like her so far. The other one wasn’t able to talk before. She transformed her and enabled her to talk.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Li Zheng and a few others popped their eyes in shock and gazed at Lin Feng.</p> <p>“She transformed the other zombie? She can enable the other zombies to talk? That’s such a scary power!”</p> <p>“Relax!” Lin Feng said, “At least, she won’t let her zombies hurt humans.”</p> <p>Li Zheng looked at Lin Feng and asked confusedly, “Great Captain, are you really so sure about that. Have you known her for long?”</p> <p>Lin Feng shook his head and said, “No. I’ve known her for about half a month. But, she saved us, and she’s preparing to help us in building the new base.”</p> <p>Li Zheng stared at Lin Feng for a while, then continued, “Why did she save you? And why has she decided to help us build the new base?”</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at him, then turned to Lin Qiao and said, “I don’t know… Perhaps, she has some reasons that we don’t know yet.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her head to glance at Li Feng, then turned to walk toward the small space. Before leaving, she said to Lin Wenwen and the others, “Stay away from them. Their minds aren’t clear right now. They might still attack people.”</p> <p>Maybe because they were now familiar with Lin Qiao, Qiu Lili, and Liu Jun, Lin Wenwen and her family wouldn’t be alert toward the other zombies around the three talking zombies. In their eyes, the zombies around them were all like Lin Qiao.</p> <p>However, as Lin Qiao had kindly reminded them, Lin Wenwen and the others backed off to show respect to her.</p> <p>The others went back to sit on the couches, looking at the strawberries that Lin Wenwen had picked earlier. Unlike the Lin Family people, Li Zheng and his teammates still didn’t dare to touch those strawberries.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao walked toward the small space, Cheng Wangxue and Lin Xiaolu walked out.</p> <p>“Xiaolu, there’re strawberries in the couch area,” Lin Qiao said to Lin Xiaolu. Hearing the word ‘strawberries’, the latter ran toward the couch area. Then, Lin Qiao looked at Cheng Wangxue and asked, “Do you know what’s her power yet?”</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue nodded and said, “I think she has spirit power. She’s a mind reader. But, she needs to touch people to read their minds.”</p> <p>“Eh? Spirit power?” Lin Qiao looked at Cheng Wangxue with surprise, “That’s a rare power. Can she read the minds of other creatures? Such as zombies?”</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue shook her head and responded, “We haven’t tried that, so we don’t know.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao smilingly nodded and said as she kept walking toward the small space, “It’s impossible to defend against spirit power effectively.”</p> <p>In the small space, she saw Liu Jun sitting by the entrance in an armchair, reading a book.</p> <p>Sensing Lin Qiao coming, she raised her head to look at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked inside the small space and asked, “Is the little thing asleep?”</p> <p>Liu Jun glanced back at Tong Tong, who was sleeping tight on the bed, then nodded. “Do you remember them?” She abruptly asked Lin Qiao a question.</p> <p>“Them? Who?” Lin Qiao failed to understand the question immediately.</p> <p>Liu Jun pointed at the couch area with her chin, then said, “You saved them. Didn’t you save them because you know them?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao confusedly shook her head while saying, “Am I supposed to know them? But, I don’t remember them. You know that I don’t remember anything that happened after the apocalypse. I saved them because I believe that the enemies of our enemy are our friends. I saved them to bring troubles to that man named Yang Jianhua. I didn’t recognize them. Do you know who they are?”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded and said, “How can you bring the people you don’t know into your space? Aren’t you afraid that someone might have evil intentions? What if someone tried to use your space and figure out a way to threaten you?”</p> <p>Hearing her, Lin Qiao smiled carelessly and said, “I wouldn’t do it a month ago, but now, the bad guys would have to be strong enough to threaten me.”</p> <p>By now, if she wanted to know what intentions a person had been holding toward her, she only needed to get close to that person to read his or her mind. Even if that person was holding evil intentions toward her, she would know that ahead of time. Besides, she was powerful now. Even a Chief from Sea City Base couldn’t win against her, so who else was able to threaten her?</p> <p>No scheme could hide from her telepathic ability, and no tricks would be able to harm her. That was unless she wasn’t able to sense that person’s thoughts.</p>",
  "Chapter 269: The Skilled Are Bold": "<p>Liu Jun looked at her helplessly, saying, “The skilled are bold. You’re really afraid of nothing.”</p> <p>“That’s called confidence,” said Lin Qiao, “Besides, this is my world, and I’m the sole owner of this place! You haven’t answered my question yet. Do you know the few people?”</p> <p>Liu Jun glanced at the group of people sitting on the couches, then said, “Many Hades Base people know them. If you find back your memories, you’ll diffidently recognize them.”</p> <p>“Is that so? Do they have anything to do with me?” Asked Lin Qiao curiously.</p> <p>Liu Jun rolled her eyes and responded, “Of course. They were all under your direct command!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with disbelief, murmuring, “Eh? No way. The few people I saved conveniently are my subordinates? No wonder they seem to be quite close with Lin Feng and the others. I thought they all know each other.”</p> <p>She didn’t notice all those after bringing the group of people into her space. She saw Mrs. Lin untie them with surprise, so she assumed that they all knew each other. After that, she didn’t pay more attention to them but exited her space.</p> <p>“Did you let Yang Jianhua go?”</p> <p>Hearing she mentioning Yang Jianhua, Lin Qiao spread her hands and said, “Yeah. I’ve heard about many things that he did to me, but I can’t remember anything. If I revenge on him now, my revenge would be meaningless. I want to take my time to deal with him after retrieving all my memories. Besides, with my current power, I can barely hurt him. He can’t hurt me either though.”</p> <p>Liu Jun looked at her and responded with, “You’re right. But, we don’t know how to restore your memory. What if you still can’t remember anything when you’re back in that place? Will you always let him live?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her, said, “If I still can’t remember a thing after going to that place, I’ll have to think of another way. However, if he boldly sent himself to me again, I won’t let him go like I did this time.”</p> <p>Liu Jun looked at her, without knowing how to continue. So, she changed the topic, said, “Where is this small space from? I think it’ll be more convenient if you get a few more small spaces like his. You see, this place is like your home now, and you often invite people here. Maybe you should just bring in a house from the outside, so we can place those furniture pieces well. Don’t you feel weird for them to stand in grasses?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the group of people and the furniture area. The furniture pieces were neatly places, yet they looked a little weird indeed.</p> <p>She had thought about getting a house into her space, but there was a problem. “Em, the buildings outside are all built on the ground. I’m unable to bring anything that’s connected with the earth into this place. Look, like that solar equipment. Only after someone removed it from the building, could I bring it in.”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded with agreement. That was indeed a problem.</p> <p>“I was going to wait for Yuan Tianxing to come back and ask him for help. As for getting more small spaces like this one, I think I might need to kill some space-powered people or zombies to do it.”</p> <p>After the last upgrade of her space, she had learned about some of the nature of this space. Earlier, this small space became a part of her space because she absorbed the space-powered man’s energy nucleus.</p> <p>If she attained the energy nuclei of some more space-powered people, or the zombie nuclei of space-powered zombies, she would be able to create more small spaces inside her space.</p> <p>“Are you saying that this small space is transferred to you from someone else? Can that even work?” Liu Jun looked at her with surprise.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to her, looking at her from head to toe while saying, “I found that you now many things. Your understanding ability is really great.”</p> <p>Liu Jun grinned and said, “If you want to give me a compliment for how smart I am, you can just do it. I won’t be shy.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>“How’s the outside now?” Liu Jun asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao closed her eyes to observe the outside world. Soon, she reopened her eyes and said, “The entire hotel building is frozen. No one can get in or out.”</p> <p>“What about…Yang Jianhua?” Asked Liu Jun.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao’s face suddenly darkened a little. “I’ll go out and take a look,” she said.</p> <p>Finished speaking, she turned and disappeared by the entrance of the small space.</p> <p>Lin Qiao exited her space, stood by the stairs on the roof. The door of the stair room was covered in a thick layer of ice. Inside the ice, were a few soldiers. She then turned to look at the group of ice statues around her, found that they were all Yang Jianhua’s soldiers.</p> <p>Her face darkened further, radiated waves of coldness and intention of killing.</p> <p>The stairs were sealed by ice. All the space inside the building should have been filled up by Yang Jianhua with ice. From the outside, Lin Qiao saw the soldiers on the stairs, who were knocked out by her earlier.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua had frozen all the soldiers that he brought here to death, including two level-five squad leaders.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know that the two squad leaders died because they tried to beg for mercy for those dead soldiers.</p> <p>“They’re useless even if I let them live. They’ll be eaten by zombies on our way back anyway. It’ll be better for me to let them die without being torn into pieces,” while speaking, Yang Jianhua waved his hands and turned the two squad leaders into ice statues.</p> <p>After watching that, the other squad leaders fell into silence.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at those dead soldiers, felt a pain from her heart.</p> <p>Those soldiers shouldn’t die. They were the soldiers of Hades Base. Yang Jianhua imprisoned their families to threatened them, so they followed him. None of them had ever thought that they would end up in this way.</p> <p>Their lives meant nothing to Yang Jianhua. He might let them live if he was in a better mood, but that didn’t happen. Instead, he killed them because he wasn’t happy.</p> <p>‘A man like him should die for ten-thousand times! How can such a man even think about being the leader of a base? I didn’t kill him, but I guess the others won’t let him live for long,’ Lin Qiao clenched her fists tight.</p> <p>The ice in the building wasn’t ordinary ice. Only until the energy contained in it was consumed up, would it slowly melt or break.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t touch those ice statues on the roof, because she knew that once she touched them, they would fall into pieces.</p> <p>She turned and entered her space, then said to Liu Jun who was looking at her, “Yang Jianhua has frozen all the soldiers that he brought here to death.”</p> <p>Liu Jun popped her eyes and said, “What? Why did he kill his own people?”</p> <p>“Those people were forced to come out with him,” said Lin Qiao, “Perhaps, he knows that those people hated him, so he never planned to bring them back to the base alive.”</p> <p>“That’s way too cruel,” said Liu Jun with disbelief, “Did the lives of those people mean nothing to him?”</p> <p>“I guess so,” Lin Qiao sighed.</p> <p>“I didn’t know that Yang Jianhua is this kind of person! A tyrant!” Liu Jun murmured with a shocked look.</p>",
  "Chapter 270: Qiu Lili is Back": "<p>Lin Qiao glanced at her, didn’t say anything but turned and exited her space again. Then, she leaped off the roof.</p> <p>The giant cage and the few large turtles in it had all become ice statues.</p> <p>The hotel building was like an enormous ice block, standing on the ground. With no other choice, Lin Qiao could only find another place for the people who were in her space at the moment.</p> <p>She wasn’t sure if Yang Jianhua would come back, and she felt that she should be careful.</p> <p>She found another hotel, which was much humbler than the first one. It had only six floors, and not too many rooms.</p> <p>She entered her space, walked to the group of people. Seeing her, those people stopped talking but looked at her.</p> <p>“What? I think I saw you go out just now. How’re things out there?”</p> <p>“Yang Jianhua has left,” said Lin Qiao, “The building where we lived before has been frozen entirely, so I found you another place.”</p> <p>“Can we go out now? Yang Jianhua left?” Lin Feng looked at her and asked.</p> <p>“He left,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and responded with, “So we can go out now. We’re terribly sorry for interrupting you in your space.”</p> <p>“You hold each other, let me try to send you all out at one time,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Feng and the others glanced at her with surprise. Then, they separated into two groups of seven, held each other’s hands or arms. The first group was the Lin Family people and Long Qingying, the second group were Lin Zheng, his teammates, Wei Jingchen and Xiao Wenxing.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pressed a hand on Long Qinging’s shoulder, then said ‘out’ silently.</p> <p>Next, she disappeared with Lin Feng’s group.</p> <p>They showed up in the middle of the lobby of the new hotel.</p> <p>“I’ll go bring the others out,” Lin Qiao took her hand away from Long Qingying, then said.</p> <p>While speaking, she flashed back into her space, and soon brought the others out.</p> <p>“Eh? Can you bring more than two people now?” Asked Lin Feng.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then pointed at Li Zheng and his people, said, “Thanks to them. They’re the reason I learned that I can bring people in and out like this. I didn’t think of it before.”</p> <p>Li Zheng looked at Lin Qiao, said, “Thank you for saving us. We never thought that we’d be saved by a zombie.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded at him.</p> <p>“Where is this place?” Lin Hao looked around and asked.</p> <p>“This is a small hotel, near the large hotel that we stayed before,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Hao nodded, then looked at Lin Feng and said, “Shall we go upstairs to see the rooms.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and said, “Sure. Go find a clean room for Mom first.”</p> <p>Then, the group of people went upstairs to find rooms.</p> <p>This small hotel was only about two-hundred meters away from the last one. The zombies in this area had been driven away by Qiu Lili long ago, and now, this building was all empty. So, the group of people can go anywhere in this building without worrying.</p> <p>At last, Lin Feng and his family stayed on the third floor, while Li Zheng and his teammates went up to the fifth floor. Lin Qiao checked all the rooms on the sixth floor, then chose two.</p> <p>She brought Liu Jun and Xie Dong out of her space, so they could clean their own rooms.</p> <p>After that, she turned and went straight up to the roof.</p> <p>In fact, Liu Jun, Xie Dong and she didn’t need to sleep, so they would be fine even if they didn’t have their own rooms.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat on the edge of the roof until daylight.</p> <p>Next day, just after dawn, she sensed Qiu Lili’s vibe from a long distance away.</p> <p>Soon later, she grasped the scents of quite a few zombies around Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was confused. ‘What happened? I told her to kill zombies and collect zombie nuclei, but why she brought a group of zombie back?’</p> <p>The clearer Lin Qiao sensed those zombie scents, the stranger she felt. She stood up, frowned slightly, facing the area where she sensed Qiu Lili from.</p> <p>Except for Qiu Lili’s scent, she recognized two different scents.</p> <p>Before long, Qiu Lili came to her from the frozen hotel.</p> <p>“Ahyayay…Ah…”</p> <p>‘What happened to you? Why is the hotel frozen?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili was still wearing a clean white dress, but her face showed a shocked and angry look.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t answer her question, but looked at the few figures scattered on the roofs behind Qiu Lili.</p> <p>“I’ll explain that to you later. Now you tell me, what are these?” Said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Right at that moment, one of the few figures suddenly pounced on Lin Qiao agitatedly.</p> <p>“Roarrrr! Roar!”</p> <p>‘You! Bad woman!’</p> <p>Looking at the young female zombie which suddenly charged at her, Lin Qiao calmly turned her body and moved her feet to dodge the zombie’s claws.</p> <p>“Why are you here?” She said.</p> <p>“Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>‘Give me my little sister back!’</p> <p>The young female zombie’s ferocious face looked even scarier when she was screaming at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After the roar, she prepared to rush at Lin Qiao again.</p> <p>At that point, Qiu Lili suddenly uttered a growl at her.</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>‘Go away!’</p> <p>The young female zombie gave a start at first, then paused, turned to look at Qiu Lili.</p> <p>“Roar? Roar?”</p> <p>‘Are you with her?’</p> <p>Qiu Lili unhappily stared at the zombie, then shouted at her, “Ahya! Ahyayaya! Ahyyeeeeah! Ahhhh!”</p> <p>‘Yeah! And that’s none of your business! If you attack her again, I’ll beat you!’</p> <p>The young female zombie flinched, then gave Lin Qiao a vicious glance. After that, she turned, swiftly hopped onto the stair room, sat on the roof, swaying her legs while staring straight down at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Ln Qiao couldn’t help but cover her forehead with a hand. “Why did you bring her here?” She asked, “Where did you find her?”</p> <p>“Ah…Ah….” Said Qiu Lili.</p> <p>‘I didn’t find her. She showed up suddenly to challenge me.’</p> <p>“Did you recognize her?” Said Lin Qiao, “She’s the zombie who stole a kid. I’ve mentioned her to you before. Have you had a glimpse of her character now?”</p> <p>“Ah…yee…” Qiu Lili pouted and said.</p> <p>‘She’s so annoying.’</p> <p>“Did she follow you here?” Lin Qiao looked at the young female zombie and asked.</p> <p>Qiu Lili nodded and said, “Yah, ahhh…Ahya…”</p> <p>‘Yeah, she can’t win me, and she loves fighting me. I don’t want to fight her.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao then glanced at the other zombies who followed Qiu Lili here. Those were five zombie leaders, and one of them was Lin Qiao’s old friend.</p> <p>That was the ice-powered zombie who just wouldn’t give up chasing her and Xie Dong at first!</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at that ice-powered zombie leader, and the zombie leader was also staring at her.</p> <p>“What are you looking at! I’m not afraid of you anymore! Come here if you dare! I’ll make you suffer!” Seeing the zombie gazing at her, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but yell at him.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie leader immediately uttered a roar at Lin Qiao, threatened to attack.</p> <p>It seemed to want to attack Lin Qiao, but didn’t move. Instead, he glanced at Qiu Lili. After that, he kept staring at Lin Qiao without making a step forward.</p>",
  "Chapter 271: Let’s Talk About It": "<p>Lin Qiao looked at Qiu Lili, pointing at the few level-five zombies behind her as she asked, “I asked you to bring back some zombie nuclei, but why did you bring back a group of living zombies?”</p> <p>Then, she sniffed at Qiu Lili and continued with surprise, “Eh? I sense many different types of energies from you. What are those?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili took off the small bag that she carried, then opened it and rummaged through it with a hand. Soon, she took out a few weirdly shaped crystal pieces and spread her fingers to show them to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Ahhhh… Ahyayaya…”</p> <p>‘I wanted to kill them. But, they were afraid, so they traded these for their lives.</p> <p>Lin Qiao picked up one of those crystal pieces, then asked, “Did these belong to animals or plants?”</p> <p>She picked up those crystal pieces one after another to sense the energies inside them. She found that the energies contained in two of these crystal pieces were similar to that in the vine kernel which she had obtained before, the rest being different. Sensing that, she felt a bit strange.</p> <p>The two should be zombie nuclei, yet she couldn’t tell which level they were at.</p> <p>Qiu Lili reached out her slender finger and pointed at each of those nuclei while explaining, “Ahhhh… Yahaha… Yeeh…”</p> <p>‘These two belonged to plants, these two belonged to zombie animals, and this one is from a level-five zombie.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the five level-five zombies who were quietly standing aside, and the young female zombie who was sitting on the roof, then asked confusedly, “Did you bring them back? Or, did they follow you here?”</p> <p>“Ahhhh… Yahaha….”</p> <p>‘I brought them back. Didn’t you say that we’re gathering a zombie squad? So, I brought them back. Ah, this one isn’t included. She followed me here!” While speaking, she pointed at the young female zombie.</p> <p>“Roar!” Hearing Qiu Lili mention her, the young female zombie lowered her head to utter an unhappy growl at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Again, Lin Qiao didn’t know what to say.</p> <p><em>‘This one seems to be a little dangerous!’</em></p> <p>“Can you control her?” Lin Qiao asked Qiu Lili, who tilted her head and looked at the former while responding, “Ahyayayaya….’</p> <p>‘Didn’t you say that she’s not evil? That’s why I didn’t send her away.</p> <p>Again, Lin Qiao didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>She had said that indeed, but she didn’t know if this zombie would attack humans or not. Besides, this young female zombie was very moody, like a bomb that could go off at any time! What if she got upset and decided to attack people?</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the young female zombie’s face which was halfway covered in scales, asking, “Why did you follow her here? I’m telling you, you’re not allowed to attack any human being around here. I can’t kill you, but if you don’t follow my words, I’ll ask Lili to punish you!”</p> <p>While speaking, she pointed at Qiu Lili, who was standing in front of her.</p> <p>However, what Lin Qiao said about attacking human beings didn’t catch the young female zombie’s attention. Instead, she roared at Qiu Lili excitedly as if she had heard something that made her happy.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>‘Your name is Lili!’</p> <p>“Roarrrr… Roar? Roar?”</p> <p>‘What’s my name then?’</p> <p>She murmured to herself, wearing a happy look as though she was making some kind of decision. But then, she paused, seeming to be confused and struggling. No one could tell what she was thinking about.</p> <p>Both Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili looked at her bewilderedly.</p> <p>Why was she so happy upon finding out Qiu Lili’s name? What happened to her?</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Qiu Lili and asked, “How was the fight between you and her? She seems to be afraid of you, but she’s not willing to leave you. What’s going on between you two?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili responded with a strange look, “Ahyayaya, Ahahahah, Ahyaya…”</p> <p>‘She can’t win against me. I don’t want to fight her, but I can’t send her away.’</p> <p>‘You need to keep an eye on her. If she loses her temper here, we’ll be in big trouble!’</p> <p>While she was speaking, the young female zombie raised her head to yell at Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili, “Roar! Oar! Oarrrr! Oar-whoo…”</p> <p>‘I know what my name should be! It’s Mengmeng! Mengmeng! Call me! Say my name!”</p> <p>“Why did you name yourself Mengmeng?” Lin Qiao looked at her confusedly.</p> <p>Qiu Lili turned her face away without looking at the young female zombie, saying, “Ahyee…”</p> <p>‘No, I won’t call you that name.’</p> <p>As Qiu Lili refused to say her name, Mengmeng immediately pulled a long face while shouting at her, “Roarrrr? Roar?”</p> <p>‘Why? Will calling my name kill you?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Mengmeng, then at Qiu Lili. Abruptly, she waved her hand at Mengmeng and asked her to come down. “Here, come down here. Let’s talk.”</p> <p>Mengmeng looked at Lin Qiao without doing what she asked. Instead, she glanced at Qiu Lili from time to time, seeming to be waiting for something.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her, wanting to laugh. Mengmeng was so much like a child!</p> <p>“You talk to her,” she thought for a moment, then said to Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Qiu Lili glanced at Lin Qiao, and as the latter nodded at her, she reluctantly turned her head to Mengmeng and roared.</p> <p>“Ahyayay, Ahyaya!”</p> <p>‘Just come down!’</p> <p>Mengmeng looked at Qiu Lili, then at Lin Qiao. Afterward, she leaped off the roof and landed beside Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“You can stay around Lili if you want, but you can’t attack the others. Do you understand that?” Lin Qiao said to her.</p> <p>“Roar? Roar?” Mengmeng didn’t understand.</p> <p>‘What does attack the others mean?’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her, trying to explain, “You see, other people are staying in this building. You can’t hurt or bite them. If you can do that, I’ll let you drink this.” As she was speaking, a cup of water showed up in her hand.</p> <p>Hearing her, Mengmeng first glanced at her confusedly. Next, when she saw the cup of water in Lin Qiao’s hand, her nose twitched slightly.</p> <p><em>‘What is it? It smells so good.’ </em>She curiously looked at the cup and couldn’t help but raise a hand to reach it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stepped backward, bringing the cup away from her while saying, “You need to promise to do what I said before I give you this.”</p> <p>“Roar?”</p> <p>‘Promise what?’</p> <p>Mengmeng looked at Lin Qiao with confusion, then glanced at Qiu Lili. Qiu Lili kept ignoring her, so she turned back to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“You can’t hurt people without a good reason, no matter they’re from around here or other places. Do you get it? As for the people around here, you need to protect them. Can you do that?” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Mengmeng thought for a moment, then nodded, still wearing a confused look. After nodding, she impatiently stared at the cup of water.</p> <p>“Remember what you promised me… No backing out!” Lin Qiao re-emphasized her point as she handed Mengmeng the cup. Qui Lili looked at Lin Qiao unsurely, asking, “Ahyayaya?”</p> <p>‘Why do I feel that she can’t understand you?’</p>",
  "Chapter 272: We’ll Let You Go if You Win": "<p>Mengmeng took over the cup and slightly turned her body as she put the cup under her nose to sniff at the water. Then, she stuck out her tongue to lick it.</p> <p>Her tongue wasn’t the same as the tongues of normal zombies. It was long and slim, quickly and nimbly dipping into the water before drawing back into Mengmeng’s mouth.</p> <p>After that, Mengmeng stuck her tongue and her green eyes glowed. Next, she started pouring the water into her mouth. After the cup was emptied, she handed it to Lin Qiao and gave a roar.</p> <p><em>‘I want more!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao took the cup and said, “You can only have three cups a day.” After saying that, she disappeared. As she reappeared in two seconds, the cup in her hand was refilled with water.</p> <p>Mengmeng took it over and drank it up before handing it back to Lin Qiao, looking at her with eager eyes while waiting for the next cup of water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao refilled the cup again for her, then said, “Alright, that’s it for today. You’ll have more tomorrow.”</p> <p>Mengmeng suddenly sensed satiety from her stomach, so she didn’t disagree with Lin Qiao this time. Instead, she swiftly climbed onto the roof of the stair room like an animal.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao turned to look at the other zombies, who were five zombie leaders. She would be able to kill one or two of them, but facing five of them, she had no chance of winning at all.</p> <p>“Lili, keep an eye on Mengmeng,” Lin Qiao said to Qiu Lili and then turned to walk to those zombie leaders while continuing, “I’ll deal with these level-fives one by one.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, she stared at the middle-aged, ice-powered male zombie that she had acquaintance with. Qiu Lili raised her head to glance at Mengmeng, then disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>Once Qiu Lili left, Mengmeng, who was sitting on the roof, got puzzled at first, then abruptly stood up. She looked around for a while, then calmly sat back down. After that, she looked at Lin Qiao with great interest.</p> <p>At that time, Lin Qiao suddenly disappeared.</p> <p>In a few seconds, the group of zombies who were standing on the roof realized what had happened. Earlier on, Lin Qiao had disappeared shortly while refilling the cup for Mengmeng. But after that, she reappeared in just three of four seconds.</p> <p>However, this time, Lin Qiao didn’t reappear in such a short span of time. Qiu Lili was no longer around, so the group of zombies began glancing around to search for Lin Qiao.</p> <p>They had no idea that Lin Qiao had already turned invisible, and was standing right behind them.</p> <p>She stood in front of the middle-aged male zombie who had chased after her, looking at the claw wound on his chest that was left by her. The wound hadn’t healed yet, and was still sealed in ice.</p> <p>As she thought, high-level zombies weren’t able to heal themselves.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t plan to bring this zombie into her space. Instead, she showed her face half a meter away from him. When showing up, her claws had already clasped his forehead. Once she moved slightly, her sharp claws would sink into his skull.</p> <p>“Roar!” The ice-powered zombie leader was startled by Lin Qiao’s sudden appearance and then shivered intensely. After giving a roar, he felt that his head was gripped by someone, which made him freeze, without daring to move even a little.</p> <p>“Last time, I took your food,” Lin Qiao said to him with composure, “I stole your prey, and you chased me for a long time. Every time, it was you chasing me while I was trying to hide. Now, let’s do a fair fight. I’ll let you leave if you win, but if you lose, you’ll have to follow my words, and only my words, in the future!”</p> <p>“Roar!” The male zombie roared at her, seeming unwilling to do what she had proposed. As they were pretty close to each other, a strong stench from his mouth blew at Lin Qiao’s face.</p> <p>Lin Qiao immediately covered her nose and said coldly, “Or, do you want me to crush your head right now?”</p> <p>While speaking, she clenched her fingers and made her claws, which were even harder than steel, sink slightly into the zombie’s scalp.</p> <p>“Roarrrr!” The middle-aged male zombie didn’t feel pain but sensed a danger, a very strong danger!</p> <p>“Roarrrrr…” Hearing the warning from the male zombie, the other zombies were immediately on alert against Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at them, then said to the male zombie, “What do you think? Will you fight me? If you refuse, you’ll die!”</p> <p>“Roar…”</p> <p>‘I’ll fight! Don’t kill me!’</p> <p>“Don’t even think about running. You won’t be able to run away from me, or Qiu Lili,” said Lin Qiao. Finishing talking, she loosened her grip and took a step backward. Once she took her claws away, the male zombie bent over and covered his head with both hands, moving backward step by step.</p> <p>He stared at Lin Qiao, his dark eyes showing fear. He couldn’t understand why she was so powerful now, as she was weaker than him not long ago.</p> <p>He felt the whole situation being so unfair. Lin Qiao was apparently stronger than him, yet she asked to fight him. Although she didn’t kill him directly, he wouldn’t have a chance of winning her!</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao did promise to let him go if he won. Perhaps… Perhaps he could really win!</p> <p>With that thought, the male zombie suddenly had a gleam of hope in his heart.</p> <p>Qiu Lili had left, but her vibe was still suppressing this whole area. Therefore, even though she had disappeared, the group of zombies didn’t dare to make any move without permission.</p> <p>The male zombie stepped further away from Lin Qiao. The latter didn’t move, but calmly crooked her finger toward the male zombie, signaling for him to start.</p> <p>The male zombie immediately waved both hands toward Lin Qiao. With that, a wave of differently sized ice pieces suddenly fell from the sky, swiftly flying toward her. Next, the male zombie lunged forward and made a circle around Lin Qiao before diving down from her side.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found that this zombie’s attacks were very random. It was like a monkey throwing stones at its enemy without even aiming. However, the male zombie used his ice power while charging at her to start a close combat. Could the combination of these two types of attacks be considered a fighting strategy?</p> <p>She looked at the wave of stone-like ice pieces which were falling toward her, then glanced at the male zombie who was charging down at her. Suddenly, she bent her legs slightly and raised both her arms as she sprung at the male zombie without dodging.</p> <p>The male zombie didn’t think that Lin Qiao would jump at him instead of dodging. As fast as possible, he swung his claws down at her. Seeing that, Lin Qiao slightly turned her left hand to push him to the side and protect herself against the male zombie’s claws. In the meanwhile, she bent her right arm and swung it at him.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>The male zombie fell on the ground and staggered a little.</p> <p>He glanced down at the few deep wounds on his arm, then turned his head to look at Lin Qiao, who landed beside him, perfectly unharmed.</p>",
  "Chapter 273: The Cup is Chewed": "<p>Lin Qiao crossed her arms before her chest as she stared at the male zombie. She had controlled her strength; otherwise, based on the distance between the two of them, the middle-aged male zombie would have been cut into pieces.</p> <p>Sensing Lin Qiao’s strength and attitude, the male zombie started to feel threatened again. Slowly, his sense of crisis suppressed the slight hope in his heart.</p> <p>He took two steps backward with hesitation to move away from Lin Qiao while black and sticky blood flowed out of the wounds on his arm. As he wiped his arm with his hand, a layer of ice appeared on those wounds, freezing the black blood.</p> <p>He stared at Lin Qiao, then suddenly charged at her again, even faster than before. He flashed across the air and showed up before her, along with a wave of cold air.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed the cold air as the floor under her feet was frozen suddenly. Ice fixed her feet to the floor, disabling her from moving.</p> <p>‘Not a bad move!’ Lin Qiao gave a compliment silently. Then, before the male zombie darted up to her, she abruptly waved a hand and released a stream of thick dark mist that surrounded her entire body.</p> <p>The male zombie saw the dark mist just as his claws were about to land on Lin Qiao’s body. He immediately stopped moving, then quickly withdrew his hands and began moving backward.</p> <p>As a zombie, he was instinctively afraid of the dark mist.</p> <p>The male zombie got as far away from Lin Qiao as possibly, then squatted without making any other move.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised a hand and sent the black mist up, making it float above her head. Meanwhile, a few wisps of the black mist covered her feet to melt the ice slowly.</p> <p>The male zombie squatted in a corner of the stair room in front of her, not looking like he was going to attack again. Seeing that, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but shout at him.</p> <p>“Again?”</p> <p>The male zombie didn’t move, only glancing at her once before lowering his head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little speechless.</p> <p>Was the male zombie giving up?</p> <p>The ice created by the male zombie contained his energy. It wasn’t as hard as Yang Jianhua’s ice, yet Lin Qiao still noticed that the few wisps of black mist could only melt it slowly.</p> <p>Therefore, she brought the cloud of dark mist down from above her head and wrapped the ice under her feet. After a whole minute, Lin Qiao was finally able to pull her feet out of the ice.</p> <p>She raised a hand and let the black mist flow back into her palm, then walked to the male zombie. Seeing her approach, the male zombie wanted very much to run away. However, he understood that he wouldn’t be able to run far. He was afraid of Lin Qiao, who was clearly a strange zombie.</p> <p>He continued squatting; each time Lin Qiao made a step toward him, he would move slightly to the side.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked up to him, then slowly lowered her head to look at him and asked, “Have you given up?”</p> <p>The male zombie quickly glanced up at her, then lowered his head again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that he had given up. She was surprised to find that he feared her dark mist so much. While thinking that, she raised a hand, and a cup of water showed up in her hand.</p> <p>“Here, drink,” Lin Qiao handed it to the male zombie.</p> <p>The zombie seemed to be attracted by some kind of scent. As he raised his head to sniff around, he saw that Lin Qiao was handing him a cup of water. He took over the cup with curiosity, then sniffed at it. After pausing slightly, he sniffed at it again, then put the cup near his mouth to lick it. Afterward, he poured the water straight into his mouth.</p> <p>After drinking the water, he spent a moment gazing at the empty cup, then suddenly opened his mouth and took a bite of the cup, caused a cracking noise.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was shocked as she hurriedly grabbed the cup back.</p> <p>Did he like the water so much that he even chewed the cup?</p> <p>Right at that moment, a voice was heard from the stair room. “I think I’ve heard something from up there…”</p> <p>“Miss. Lu is up there. Is Qiu Lili back?”</p> <p>“I’ve sensed energy fluctuations. Is a fight happening there?”</p> <p>Following the voices, three people soon showed up in the stair room—Lin Hao, Li Zheng and Lei Yao. The three of them stood by the door, confusedly looking at the male zombie who was squatted in a corner, and the few level four or five zombies standing on the nearby roofs.</p> <p>“These… Why are so many high-level zombies here? They’re not all zombie leaders, are they?” Sensing the strong vibes of these zombies, Li Zheng asked alertly.</p> <p>“Eh? Where are all these strange zombies from?” Lin Hao wasn’t as nervous as the other, only observing the group of zombies curiously.</p> <p>He saw that Lin Qiao was holding a broken cup while facing the zombie in the corner. He didn’t know what she was doing.</p> <p>“Don’t move! They are all zombie leaders. Lili just brought them back. They haven’t been trained, so they might attack you. You can either go downstairs now, or stand there and not move,” Lin Qiao turned to say to the three.</p> <p>Abruptly, she raised her head to say to Mengmeng, “Don’t you forget what you promised to me just now!”</p> <p>Mengmeng, who was preparing to pounce down upon the three people, immediately sat back down.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao shouting at the roof of the stair room, Lin Hao and the other two raised their head to find a head sticking out of the edge of the roof. Mengmeng was staring at them with a pair of black eyes, which had green and erect pupils in it.</p> <p>“Eh!” The three people were all startled, as they had completely no idea that Mengmeng was there!</p> <p>Mengmeng had given them a very strong suppression. She wasn’t calm and mild like Qiu Lili, as her eyes were filled with aggressiveness.</p> <p>Li Zheng and his people hadn’t encountered any zombie king or queen before, but they had met zombie leaders. Now, as quite a few zombie leaders were standing right in front of them, they didn’t dare to move even if they wanted to!</p> <p>Lin Hao had seen Qiu Lili before, so he understood that Mengmeng was also a zombie queen just like Qiu Lili. But unlike Qiu Lili, Mengmeng looked wilder, seeming ready to attack people at any time.</p> <p>Once the three people showed up, all the others fixed their eyes on them, making their scalp numb.</p> <p>“We… Can we go downstairs? This place is scary!”</p> <p>At that point, a white figure suddenly showed up on the middle of the roof and uttered a roar toward the four zombie leaders who were scattered on the nearby roofs.</p> <p>“Ahya!”</p> <p>Following the roar, the four zombie leaders all leaped toward the hotel building.</p> <p>Seeing that, Li Zheng and Lei immediately put themselves on full alert. But unlike them, Lin Hao was only half alert, because he believed that Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili wouldn’t let those zombies attack the three of them.</p> <p>Hearing Qiu Lili summon the zombies, the middle-aged male zombie intended to go to her. However, Lin Qiao was still standing before him. Should he move or not? If he didn’t go, would the big zombie eat him?</p> <p>In the eyes of zombie leaders, zombie queens and kings were big zombies.</p>",
  "Chapter 274: Zombie Bodyguard": "<p>He glanced again at Lin Qiao, who was standing in front of him. In fact, he didn’t want to go to Qiu Lili now, as he wanted more of the water that Lin Qiao gave him just now.</p> <p>Sensing his thoughts, Lin Qiao said, “No more… You can only have one cup a day, under conditions.</p> <p>“Whoo…” the male zombie quietly looked at her, waiting for her to continue.</p> <p>“Firstly, you have to follow my words,” said Lin Qiao. “Secondly…”</p> <p>She pointed at Lin Hao and the other two as she continued, “Them, and the other people like them in this building… you can’t hurt them, and you have to protect them. Do you understand? Nod if you do.”</p> <p>The male zombie wasn’t as smart as an adult human being, but had the IQ of a seven or eight years old child. Therefore, he was able to understand Lin Qiao, and he immediately nodded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao easily sensed the male zombie’s submission. If the latter lied to her, she would kill him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised a hand toward the male zombie while saying, “Alright… Stand up and do what I said. I’ll give you a cup of water every day.”</p> <p>The male zombie slowly stood up while glancing at Lin Qiao and the other two. After that, he raised his head to sniff around, then looked back at her. Lin Qiao pointed at a tall building that was around twenty meters away, then said to him, “Go stay over there, and don’t run about. Stay in that building. That building is your territory now.”</p> <p>The male zombie turned to glance at that building, then looked at the broken cup in Lin Qiao’s hand. At last, he took a glance at Qiu Lili.</p> <p>He wasn’t sure if the big zombie would let him go over there or not.</p> <p>Qui Lili sensed his gaze, so she turned back to roar at him, “Ah, ahyaya!”</p> <p>‘Go, do what she said.’</p> <p>After receiving Qiu Lili’s order, the male zombie immediately relaxed. He glanced at Lin Qiao for one last time, then turned and leaped up from the roof, landing on the top floor of the building that Lin Qiao was pointing at. Then, he rested his arm on the guardrail of a corridor, looking at Lin Qiao and the others.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the Lin Hao and the other two who didn’t dare to move, and found that they were all staring at her with a strange look in their eye.</p> <p>Lei Yao, who didn’t talk much, asked Lin Hao, “Is she going to let these zombie leaders… be our bodyguards?”</p> <p>Lin Hao had also been looking at Lin Qiao, Qiu Lili, and the other zombies with confusion. With a low voice, he responded, “I have no idea. But, if I didn’t get what she said wrong, I guess that’s true.”</p> <p>“Zombie leaders serving as bodyguards… It’s honestly the first time for me to hear something like this… And, we’re the lucky ones,” Li Zheng joined the conversation.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced up at Mengmeng, then waved a hand at her and said, “You, come down!”</p> <p>However, Mengmeng just looked at her and didn’t move.</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled at her and continued, “Alright! If you refuse to follow my words, you shouldn’t come to me for the water again.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Mengmeng instantly leaped off the roof and quietly landed before Lin Qiao.</p> <p>In fact, after drinking the water, her hostility toward Lin Qiao had become weaker, and her repulsion was halfway gone. But still, she was a little uncomfortable to do what Lin Qiao said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned around and walked toward Qiu Lili. Mengmeng followed behind her, glancing back at Lin Hao and the other two human beings from time to time.</p> <p>Receiving that glance from Mengmeng, the three humans, who were preparing to quietly move backward and sneak away while the group of zombies weren’t paying attention to them, suddenly froze.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked up to Qiu Lili, looking at the four zombie leaders who were at different ages, then asked her, “What are their powers?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili pointed at then one by one, saying, “Ahya, Aha, Ahyaya, Ahahah.”</p> <p>‘Fire, green, earth, metal.’</p> <p>The fire-powered one was a child, who looked only around ten years old. He was a little boy, but now looked rather scary. The upper part of his face was undamaged, yet his jaw was entirely torn off his face, hanging over his neck. His bloody mouth cracked was from side to side. At the same time, his eyes were glowing with a faint red light.</p> <p>The green-powered one was a young female zombie. Her short hair were stuck to her scalp with blood. She was about five-feet and five-inches tall and slim. She had long legs flat chest, and a body that was fully covered in blood. It seemed that she used to be a neat girl before death.</p> <p>The earth-powered zombie was a male one, about thirty-years old. His head remained in shape, but his arms, chest, and stomach were all covered in bloody holes.</p> <p>The last one was a gray-haired elderly zombie, wearing a pair of glasses. Strangely, his hair were still shiny, and not dirty at all.</p> <p>The elderly zombie was wearing a traditional Chinese garment made of expensive fabric. He was the cleanest one among the four.</p> <p>While Lin Qiao was observing the four zombies, they were observing her as well. They had watched the fight between her and the ice-powered male zombie, and were all afraid of her dark mist for some reason.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao approached them, the four zombies fixed their dark eyes on her, as if they were afraid that she might suddenly attack them with the dark mist.</p> <p>“Ahyaya! Ahyayaya!” At that moment, Qiu Lili roared at the four zombie leaders.</p> <p>‘Why are you looking at her? You all need to follow her orders too!”</p> <p>The four zombie leaders immediately turned to Qiu Lili, their eyes filled with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was powerful indeed, but her vibe wasn’t strong enough to suppress the four zombie leaders. Obviously, the four zombie leaders weren’t willing to unconditionally follow the words of a zombie who was not stronger than themselves.</p> <p>Qiu Lili sensed their unwillingness, so she said, “Ahya, Ahyayayay!”</p> <p>‘If you don’t want to follow her words, you can fight her as well!’</p> <p>Hearing that, the four zombies immediately wore an aggressive look while staring at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Seeing that, the latter gave a faint smile and turned up her palm to quickly release a stream of dark mist. From behind her, a cloud of dark mist slowly rose to above the four zombies.</p> <p>Seeing the large cloud of dark mist above their heads, the four zombie leaders became nervous.</p> <p>“Roar… Whooo…” They each took two steps backward, alertly gazing at the dark cloud in the sky and looking like frightened animals.</p> <p>“Roar!” Even Mengmeng couldn’t stay calm as she leaped backward. But then, she found that Qiu Lili made no reaction to that dark mist. Therefore, she stepped forward, then inched her way to Qiu Lili’s side.</p> <p>“Wow! Doesn’t she have space power? Why has she suddenly released this strange black mist?” Lin Hao and the other two were going to sneak downstairs, but before they did that, they found that the sky above their heads was covered by a dark cloud.</p> <p>“Does she have two different types of power?” Li Zheng asked with surprise.</p> <p>Lei Yao was observing the reaction of the group of zombie leaders. While thinking, he said, “I think something is in the dark cloud, and those zombie leaders seem to be very afraid of it.”</p> <p>Hearing him, the other two instantly turned to look at the group of zombie leaders. As Lei Yao said, the four zombies all looked nervous and alert at the moment.</p>",
  "Chapter 275: One Cup A Day": "<p>When Qiu Lili was organizing the group of newly recruited zombie leaders, someone else came upstairs.</p> <p>Feng Yuming ran up toward the roof. As he walked up the last stair step, he saw three men standing there motionlessly while staring outside.</p> <p>“Oi, you’re really up here. What’re you looking at?” Feng Yuming came up and asked curiously.</p> <p>Li Zheng and the other two glanced back at him together, but didn’t answer his question. Instead, they turned back and continued looking outside.</p> <p>Their reaction made Feng Yuming even more curious. He stepped forward and put hands on Li Zheng’s shoulders, then stuck out his head from behind Li Zheng. As a result, he saw a group of zombies standing in the middle of the roof, mostly covered in blood.</p> <p>“Ah! Zombies!” He uttered a scream, then sprung up and turned to run.</p> <p>The three people and group of zombies on the roof were all startled by his scream. They turned to look at him, but only saw a figure running downstairs in haste. Within a blink, Feng Yuming disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>“Damn, I nearly had a heart attack! That bloody kid! The zombies didn’t frighten us, yet he’ll scare us to death sooner or later,” Li Zheng was terribly startled by Feng Yuming. Lin Hao and Lei Yao both wore the same look as he did.</p> <p>“Is he always so gutless?” Lin Hao asked, “Is he always so afraid of zombies? How did you manage to get through your journey here?”</p> <p>Li Zheng sighed and responded, “Don’t even mention it…”</p> <p>“He basically screamed all the way,” said Lei Yao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao who stood aside, turned to say to the four zombies, “Are you going to follow my words or not? Or do you want a fight?”</p> <p>The four zombies stared at Lin Qiao aggressively. However, they glanced up at the dark cloud, then hesitated. At that point, Qiu Lili became impatient and gave a series of shouts unhappily, “Ah, Ahyaya, Ahyaya…”</p> <p>‘Alright, stop playing. I said that you need to follow her orders, so you have to. If you disobey, I’ll rip your heads open!’</p> <p>After saying that, she bared her teeth toward the four zombie leaders, her face showing ferocity.</p> <p>“Whoo…” The four zombie leaders were immediately terrified. They flinched, not daring to move.</p> <p>As Qiu Lili seemed to lose her temper, Lin Qiao decided to not waste any more time. She took back the black mist and made the sky bright again. After that, she threw the broken cup at a corner, and a new one appeared in her hand, filled with water. Holding the cup of water, she waved at the boy zombie.</p> <p>“Alright, you come here first,” she said.</p> <p>The boy zombie glanced at Lin Qiao but didn’t move, turning to look at Qiu Lili instead. Qiu Lili didn’t even want to talk to him. Instead, she directly showed him her claws.</p> <p>The boy zombie shivered on seeing that, then obediently walked toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at his bloody mouth and chin, then handed him the cup and said, “Drink it.”</p> <p><em>‘This kid’s chin is nearly fallen off, so how is he supposed to drink the water? </em>‘ she wondered.</p> <p>The boy zombie carefully took over the cup while glancing at Qiu Lili from time to time. Then, he put the cup under his nose to sniff at it, after which, he was attracted by the energy contained in the water.</p> <p>After sniffing, he directly raised his head and poured the water into his throat. He gulped noisily and soon emptied the cup.</p> <p>Having finished the cup of water, he closed his eyes to feel it. As he opened his eyes again, a red light flashed across those eyes. Then, he raised his head to look at Lin Qiao with sparkling eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took back the cup, then pointed at Lin Hao and the other two humans while saying, “Alright, you can only have one cup a day. And, you can’t hurt the people in this building. You also need to protect them from being harmed.”</p> <p>After being startled by Feng Yuming, Lin Hao and the other two were less nervous now. At this point, they felt like they were watching a show.</p> <p>“Ahyaya! Ahayaya!” Qiu Lili hastened Lin Qiao with discontentment. ‘Hurry up! I want to evolve!’</p> <p>While speaking, she spread her fingers to show Lin Qiao those energy nuclei in her hand.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then gave a cup of water to each of the remaining three zombie leaders. When it was the elderly zombie’s turn, she found that his way of drinking was different from that of the others.</p> <p>The other zombies all impatiently poured the water into their mouths; but unlike them, the elderly zombie drank the water with small sips. Moreover, before every sip, he would blow the water slightly.</p> <p><em>‘Oi, the water is cold, so why are you blowing? Can you drink it faster? You’re drinking with an elegant manner, but… </em>‘ Lin Qiao complained silently.</p> <p>Indeed, the elderly zombie had an elegant manner of drinking. Apart from that, he had looked around when taking over the cup. Lin Qiao knew that he was looking for a couch or chair!</p> <p><em>‘You need to sit on a couch or chair to drink water? Is your life so exquisite? You’re just a zombie!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao wasn’t the only one surprised. Even the three humans who were standing aside and watching now stared at him with a strange look.</p> <p>After all zombie leaders had some water, Lin Qiao found a spot for each of them and said something to them. Only after that did she take over the few energy nuclei from Qiu Lili’s hand.</p> <p>“Viney has been sleeping recently. I’ll wake her up first and bring you in later.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili nodded at her, then watched Lin Qiao disappear in front of her.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Qiao entered her space and sensed some human scents. Those were the scents left by Lin Feng, Li Zheng, and the others. Even the air in her space was now filled with their scents.</p> <p>Of course, those scents had faded a little already.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know where the air in her space came from, and where it would go.</p> <p>Holding the few energy nuclei, she stood by the lakeside and shouted at the lake, “Viney, Viney, wake up! We have energy nuclei!”</p> <p>She called Viney’s name a few times, but nothing happened in the lake.</p> <p>Looking at the lake surface, she didn’t know what to do. <em>‘I can’t wake Viney up, so what should I do? Normally, Viney would sense the energy nuclei once I brought them in here. But, why isn’t it working this time?’</em></p> <p><em>‘I don’t need to go down to the lake bottom to bring these nuclei to her, do I?’</em></p> <p>“Viney?” Lin Qiao called Viney’s name once again and waited for a few seconds. However, Viney still didn’t respond.</p> <p>Looking at the peaceful lake, Lin Qiao sighed.</p> <p><em>‘Alright, I’ll go down and take a look. I haven’t observed the world down there yet.’</em></p> <p>She put the energy nuclei on the ground, then began taking off her clothes. After making herself naked, she picked up the energy nuclei and walked into the lake.</p> <p>The cool water contained a strong energy, which made her feel comfortable. She didn’t feel cold, so she kept walking down into the water. When the water reached her chest, she dove in.</p> <p>She didn’t need to breathe in the water. The only thing she needed to do was paddle with her limbs and swim toward the lake bottom.</p> <p>The clear water was colorless in her eyes. However, once she narrowed her eyes, she was able to see a dark-greenness.</p> <p>While sensing Viney’s vibe and location, she kept swimming downward.</p>",
  "Chapter 276: The World Down in the Lake": "<p>Lin Qiao spent quite a while swimming downward. She felt that at least a couple of minutes had passed, yet the lake bottom was still nowhere near. She sensed that Viney was pretty close to her, yet she swam for a while but couldn’t see the bottom of the lake.</p> <p>It was so weird!</p> <p>Holding the energy nuclei, she kept swimming downward. She couldn’t tell how long she had swum, but after one hour or two, she finally saw a shred of shadow in the water. As she went further down, the shadow grew more and more obvious.</p> <p>Soon, she saw something dark-purple.</p> <p>She didn’t think that the lake was actually so deep. It was scary!</p> <p>As she got close enough, she found that the dark-purple thing she saw was the ground. Soon, she stood on the ground and looked around, but found no bounds.</p> <p>She didn’t see Viney.</p> <p>She had a sense that Viney was here. Where exactly was Viney?</p> <p>Standing on the ground, she felt a little strange. The dark-purple ground was soft like a yoga mat. She had been taking a great water resistance down in the lake, and only a small buoyancy force. Therefore, she wasn’t floating up.</p> <p>She plodded for two steps on the lake bottom but couldn’t see Viney; so with no other choice, she decided to search around. At the same time, she was calling Viney’s name in her heard constantly, hoping that it could hear her.</p> <p>While walking, she suddenly saw a dented area. She walked over to look at it with curiosity, then found a long crack.</p> <p>It was very dark in the lake, so she didn’t notice the crack earlier. But now, as she got closer, she finally saw it.</p> <p>It was all dark in the two-meters-wide crack, and nothing could be seen.</p> <p><em>‘Damn, where on earth is this place!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed Viney’s vibe from the crack, so she wondered if she should go down there. She hesitated, because she couldn’t see anything in there. Even when narrowing her eyes, she was only able to see a dark redness.</p> <p>She sensed no danger from down there, but being unable to see or feel anything made her feel threatened! However, she was sure that Viney was down there. For this reason, she needed to go down… She had to!</p> <p>After making the decision, she put her legs down from the edge of the crack. Then, she clasped the soft ground with her claws. The strange thing was that her claws which had stuck in the soft ground were actually able to hold her body steadily.</p> <p>She slowly moved her claws to crawl downward, and soon, she could see nothing but darkness upon raising her head.</p> <p>Where in the world was she?</p> <p>She thought that she would need to crawl for long before reaching the bottom, but unexpectedly, her foot suddenly felt the ground after she had moved down for a few meters.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? So fast!’</em></p> <p>She turned around and narrowed her eyes, then saw a giant sphere which was glowing with a faint green light. She walked over and reached out a hand to gently touch the giant green sphere. As she thought, she touched some vines.</p> <p>The energy that she felt from the vines was very feeble. No wonder Viney had shrunk into herself and fallen into deep sleep.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pressed a zombie nucleus on the giant sphere. When the zombie nucleus touched the vines, the faintly glowing green vines sparkled, and then Lin Qiao’s hand sensed a vibration.</p> <p>The delighted Lin Qiao quickly pressed all the other energy nuclei on Viney’s body.</p> <p>As she expected, those energy nuclei soon disappeared. Then, the vines under her hands began moving. The dim green light grew brighter and brighter, soon illuminating this area. Before long, this entire place was turned beautifully green.</p> <p>Afterward, the large sphere began shifting shape like a monster as the frizzy vines started wagging and extending toward all directions.</p> <p>An arm-thick vine quickly coiled around Lin Qiao’s waist.</p> <p><em>‘Mama! Mama! Mama!’</em></p> <p>A happy voice was immediately heard from Lin Qiao’s mind.</p> <p>She wasn’t able to talk in the water, so instead, she said to Viney in her mind,<em>‘Send me up.’</em></p> <p><em>‘Alright!’</em></p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao felt that she was lifted up by the vine around her waist, and a strong force pushed her straight upward. She was sent up much more quickly than how she came down, and before long, she went out of the water.</p> <p>Only after Lin Qiao walked out of the water to the lakeside did Viney unwrap her body.</p> <p>While walking, Lin Qiao said, “Viney, you should absorb the energy in the few nuclei now. After that, you need to help Qiu Lili activate her bodily functions.”</p> <p>Viney touched Lin Qiao’s arm and sent a message to her, <em>‘Alright… But I might take a while to absorb the energy. Mama, please be patient and wait for me. </em>‘</p> <p>“Sure!” Lin Qiao walked to the lakeside while nodding and picking up her clothes. Meanwhile, Viney’s vine drew back into the lake, then sank into the water.</p> <p>After experiencing the quietness down in the lake, Lin Qiao could still sense Viney’s activity even after she went back into the water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that Viney needed some time to absorb the energy. So, she put her clothes on, then turned and walked toward the woods.</p> <p>She went through the grassland to get to the woods, and as she arrived there, she found a large pile of supplies that she had collected from the Upper City District and Pinghu District earlier.</p> <p>As she had stored these supplies in the woods on purpose, the group of people who stayed in her space earlier on didn’t find them. All sorts of metal cabinets were piled in the woods along with some buckets and boxes, all filled with rice, flour, and some dried foods.</p> <p>She only visited a few nearby storages; all those storages were untouched, so she had collected a considerable amount of food.</p> <p>These foods could last a person for five years.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced around at the weird-looking trees. She didn’t know where they came from, or what they were here for.</p> <p>As she was walking around in the woods to observe those trees, she suddenly sensed a strong energy vibration from the lake. She stopped and turned around to look at the lake, then walked out of the woods.</p> <p>Once she came out of the woods, she saw that the waves in the lake were running high, and the water level seemed to be rising slowly.</p> <p>She hurriedly ran to the lakeside and carried the chair to the woods area, then shouted at the two zombies who were sitting in the buckets with their eyes popped while staring at the lake in fear without daring to move.</p> <p>“Stop staring at the lake! Come out! Help me move things! First, carry your buckets up!”</p> <p>Hearing her order, the two naked zombies immediately jumped out, each dragging a bucket and running toward her.</p> <p>The energy in the lake was way too strong. Therefore, the two zombies felt that they were like two tiny ants that were so weak that even a single wave from the lake could kill them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s words made them feel like they were suddenly saved.</p>",
  "Chapter 277: Viney Breaks Into Level Three": "<p>Lin Qiao dragged the chair which was placed by the lakeside to the clearing before the small space. Then, she moved the few pots and buckets to that area as well. Only after that did she walk over to the lake to look at the edge of the water and measure the rise of the water level.</p> <p>Then, she turned back to glance at the couches, tables, and cabinets. She didn’t know if the water would reach that area, but she still felt that she should better move those furniture pieces to farther places.</p> <p>It was same for that pile of pumpkins and potatoes.</p> <p>She looked at the two zombies who had dragged the two buckets to her. Ignoring their naked bodies, she pointed at the grassland and said to them, “Pour the water in the grass, then place the buckets over there. After that, come back to carry these furniture pieces to that area too.”</p> <p>While speaking, she pointed at the clearing before the woods.</p> <p>The woods and the lake were parted by the grassland, which was about two-hundred-meters-wide. Lin Qiao couldn’t tell how much would the water-level rise, but she still decided to take some precautions and move everything away.</p> <p>Besides, after the last upgrade, two clean clearings had emerged in her space—one between the grassland and the woods, and one before the small space.</p> <p>As the two zombies were piling the pumpkins and potatoes before the woods, Lin Qiao dragged the furniture pieces into the small space one by one.</p> <p>After carrying the couches, tables, and beds all into the small space by herself, Lin Qiao turned to look at the lake and found that the stone stove that she had built earlier had already been soaked. The three-meters-wide soil ground between the lake and the grass was soaked as well. By now, the water had reached the grass.</p> <p>Squeak! Squeak! The sounds of mice were heard.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to find two mice hiding under a bed. The grey rabbit had run out of the grass as well. At the moment, it was squatting by the lakeside, looking at the strawberry field and then at the lake water.</p> <p>The rabbit seemed to be worrying that the water might flood the strawberry field.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao turned back, she suddenly found something wrong.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Damn! Why did the small space go further away?’</em></p> <p>Looking at the small space which was meters away from her, Lin Qiao was a little stunned. Earlier on, she was focusing on the lifting, but didn’t notice the change of her space. Now, as she had finished the work, she found that the small space had moved away.</p> <p>She raised her head to look around, then found that the space had become larger than before.</p> <p>The woods seemed to have expanded as well.</p> <p>The water in the lake was still waving, showing no sign of calming down.</p> <p>She then looked at the two zombies. They had carried all pumpkins and potatoes away from the lakeside, and were squatting far away from the lake at the moment.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched the water submerge the grass for about a meter. After that, the lake surface gradually quieted down. Next, a few arm-thick vines reached out of the water. Viney’s vines didn’t grow thicker, but their color had turned into jade white.</p> <p>If Lin Qiao didn’t go down to the lake bottom, she wouldn’t know that Viney’s vines were actually no shorter than a thousand meters. She couldn’t tell how deep she had been, but she knew that she had spent a long time diving down.</p> <p>The tips of the jade-white vines had a few tiny green leaves on them. Through the water surface, a vine reached toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the lakeside and watched the vine coil around her hand. However, the first thing that Viney said wasn’t about her.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, those naked people are so ugly… They butts are exposed…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little speechless.</p> <p><em>‘They are no longer human beings, so they don’t care about their butts… </em>‘ she said in her heart.</p> <p><em>‘But… My eyes hurt when I look at them… </em>‘ said Viney.</p> <p>Lin Qiao burst out in laughter on hearing that. <em>‘Alright, I’ll make them wear something later. How are you now? Have you upgraded?’</em></p> <p>Viney twisted the few vines in the water and said, <em>‘Yes, yes, I’m a level higher… I’m at level-three now… When I got to level-five, I’ll be able to go out… I can see the outside now! It’s so, so large…’</em></p> <p>“Eh? You can see the outside?” Lin Qiao asked with surprise, “How?”</p> <p><em>‘Yes, yes </em>,’ said Viney, <em>‘Through Mama’s body. </em>‘</p> <p>“My body?” Lin Qiao was confused.</p> <p><em>‘Yes, yes </em>,’ Viney responded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment, but failed to figure it out. She guessed that Viney was able to sense the outside world through her sensations. She didn’t plan to spend too much time on this question though. Since Viney had upgraded again, she should be able to fix and activate Qiu Lili’s body.</p> <p>“Alright Viney, can you fix Lili’s body now?”</p> <p><em>‘Yes, yes… Viney is full now, </em>‘ replied Viney.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood Viney’s meaning. She meant that she was full of energy now, and was able to do some work.</p> <p>“Alright then!” said Lin Qiao, “I’ll bring Lili here. Wait for us.”</p> <p>After saying that, she didn’t flash out immediately, but turned to walk to the closet. She took out two sets of adults’ clothes, then waved her hands toward the two zombies.</p> <p>“You two, come here.”</p> <p>The two zombies looked at her and hesitated shortly, then walked toward her. Lin Qiao handed them the clothes, then asked, “Do you know how to put these on?”</p> <p>The two zombies reacted differently. The male zombie only gazed at the clothes on Lin Qiao’s hand without taking them over. But unlike him, the female zombie curiously took over the clothes, then looked at them from up to down.</p> <p>Soon, a tearing noise was heard, as the female zombie tore a shirt.</p> <p>“Ah!” Lin Qiao stared at the female zombie, then glanced at the male zombie. At last, she couldn’t help but rest one hand on her waist and the other on her forehead. As she did that, the hand on her forehead accidentally slipped to the back of her head.</p> <p>She rubbed her bald head, then sighed at the two zombies.</p> <p>“You can’t tear this. You need to wear this… Do you understand?” She said to the female zombie, “I’ll help you once, then you have to memorize it.”</p> <p>Then, she picked up the panty after getting down on one knee and said to the female zombie, “Here, put your foot in.”</p> <p>The female zombie looked at her bewilderedly, as if she were a psychopath.</p> <p>Lin Qiao waited for a short while, but the female zombie gave her no response. So, she raised her head to find the look in the zombie’s eyes.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! What am I doing? I’m trying to dress a zombie, and the zombie is seeing me as nuts! Why?’</em></p> <p>“Why are you looking at me? Put your foot in! Left foot! Not this foot, that foot… Good! Now, put the other foot in… Not this side! The other side! One foot each side, not two! Alright, stand straight!”</p> <p>After putting the panty on the female zombie with some effort, Lin Qiao made her wear a pair of mini-shorts. She couldn’t find any pants in the closet, only dresses and mini-shorts. Therefore, Lin Qiao took a pair of mini-shorts and a shirt for the female zombie. But unexpectedly, the zombie tore the shirt.</p> <p>Soon, Lin Qiao noticed the giant wound on the female zombie’s head, and felt that it might frighten kids.</p> <p>To solve that problem, she picked a baseball hat as she went back to the closet for another shirt. She didn’t manage to find a new shirt, so she put the torn one on the female zombie, then covered her head with the hat.</p> <p><em>‘Hmm… not bad </em>!’ Lin Qiao said to herself.</p>",
  "Chapter 278: It’s Qiu Lili’s Turn": "<p>After dressing the female zombie, Lin Qiao turned to dress the male zombie. She tried not to look at his body at first, but once she squatted, her eyes landed right on the male zombie’s private parts.</p> <p>“Eh-hem.”</p> <p>She silently turned her face and reached out her hands to prop open the underwear for the male zombie. Before she said any word, the male zombie put a foot into the underwear.</p> <p>These two zombies were quite smart. When Lin Qiao asked them to dress themselves, they were confused, and didn’t know how to begin. However, after watching Lin Qiao do it once, they had had both learned and memorized how to do it. In fact, their learning abilities were quite impressive.</p> <p>After quickly putting some clothes on the two zombies and making them look like human beings, Lin Qiao brought them out of the space. They were soaked in the water in her space for a couple of days, so Lin Qiao thought that it was time for them to go out and breathe some fresh air.</p> <p>Once out, Lin Qiao found that only Mengmeng stayed on the roof. She sat on the roof the stair room, gazing at the cloudy sky. As Lin Qiao and the two zombies abruptly showed up, she immediately looked down at them.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>‘You’re finally out!’</p> <p>“Where’s Lili?” Lin Qiao looked at her and asked. Mengmeng leaped off the roof and darted up to her as she shouted, “Roar! Roarrrrr! Roar… roar… roar!”</p> <p>‘Liar! You said that you’ll give me three cups of water a day… Now you owe me… Three cups a day, so six cups for two days… Three days, four days, five days… You owe me fifteen cups!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her speechlessly. Mengmeng didn’t answer her question, but only cared about the fact that Lin Qiao didn’t provide her with the water!</p> <p>“Five days? I was in my space for five days?” Lin Qiao didn’t think that she spent so much time in her space.</p> <p>Mengmeng moved around her while yelling, “Roarrrrr…”</p> <p>“Water, water, water…”</p> <p>“Alright, alright, stop! I’ll get you the water,” Lin Qiao looked at her and replied helplessly. While she was speaking, a bailer suddenly appeared in her hand, filled with lake water.</p> <p>That was more than three cups.</p> <p>Mengmeng immediately reached out her hands and took over the bailer, then turned and prepared to leave. Before Lin Qiao called her, a white figure flashed across the air and landed beside Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Ahya!”</p> <p>‘I’m here,’ Qiu Lili shouted at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her and said, “Em, Viney is ready. She has absorbed the energy. When you get into the lake, she’ll filter the energy and give it to you, to fix your body and activate your bodily functions.”</p> <p>“Ahyayaya!” Qiu Lili nodded excitedly.</p> <p>‘Hurry up!’</p> <p>“Stay around here… Don’t run about,” Lin Qiao turned to say to the two zombies. Then, she held Qiu Lili’s arm and disappeared with her.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili disappeared, the two zombies immediately moved to the sides, leaping off the roof from both sides and going downstairs. They did that because Mengmeng’s vibe had made them feel terribly uncomfortable, and they had sensed the vibes of many other zombies who were more powerful than them from nearby.</p> <p>They didn’t dare to move without Lin Qiao’s permission. Once she gave her order, they immediately ran away from Mengmeng.</p> <p>Mengmeng didn’t pay much attention to Qiu Lili and Lin Qiao’ disappearance, but only paused slightly. After all, at that moment, she was gulping the lake water.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After being brought into the space by Lin Qiao, Qiu Lili looked at the upgraded space with surprise.</p> <p>“Whaaa…” Once she was in, she found that the space had changed. ‘It’s bigger…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Yes, the space seems to expand once Viney upgrades. Take off your clothes, then go down the lake.”</p> <p>Then, she shouted at the lake, “Viney, bring Lili down.”</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p> <p>A few jade-white vines quickly rose from the lake surface and danced while reaching toward the lakeside.</p> <p>“Ahyaya?” Qiu Lili hesitated when Lin Qiao told her to take off her clothes.</p> <p>‘Do I need to take off my clothes?’</p> <p>“Even if you keep them on, they’ll all disappear soon,” said Lin Qiao, “Just go into the water. I won’t look at you. I’ll go out.”</p> <p>While speaking, she turned and disappeared. In fact, even if she weren’t here, she would still be able to see things in this place.</p> <p>After Lin Qiao left, Qiu Lili looked at the white vines which had been quietly waiting for her by the lake, then pinched the hemline of her dress with hesitation. However, she only hesitated for a few seconds, then started to take off her clothes. Before stripping herself, she looked around, then ran to the furniture area and brought a chair to the lakeside.</p> <p>After that, she took off her clothes, folded them neatly, then put them on the chair.</p> <p>Then, she awkwardly covered her chest with one hand, her crotch area with the other, and walked into the lake. Viney reached a vine to her and slowly coiled around her wrist to bring her down into the water.</p> <p><em>‘Sister Lili, don’t be afraid… Viney will be very gentle…’</em></p> <p>Qiu Lili was surprised to hear the voice which didn’t belong to her from her own mind. “Ahyaya?” she said.</p> <p>‘Viney?’</p> <p><em>‘Yes, yes, Viney is here… </em>‘ Viney replied.</p> <p>“Ahyaya?” Qiu Lili asked.</p> <p>‘Will it hurt?’</p> <p><em>‘A little… You need to endure that…’ </em>said Viney.</p> <p>As Qiu Lili went into the water, Viney’s vines wrapped around her waist and legs, gently dragging her toward the deeper area.</p> <p>Outside the space, Lin Qiao observed the sky and figured that it was afternoon time. Then, she sensed the surrounding vibes and found that the group of zombie leaders were obediently staying in their places. However, at the moment, they had all been gazing at her, their eyes showing their eagerness.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood what they were eager for. As same as Mengmeng, they were thinking about the lake water.</p> <p>The vibes of the dozens of people in the hotel building were thriving. Yuan Tianxing wasn’t back yet; it had been quite a few days, and Lin Qiao wondered when he would come back. It might be difficult to hire people for the first time, but he still shouldn’t spend too long on that.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the five zombie leaders, then waved her hands at them while saying, “You all come over.”</p> <p>Once she uttered a sound, the group of zombie leaders swiftly darted to her. Even the polite elderly zombie seemed to be a little impatient now.</p> <p>The five zombie leaders came up to Lin Qiao and stood in a line, staring straight at her with their dark eyes, which were glowing with faint, colorful lights.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed the cups in her space. The ones used by Lin Feng and his people were placed on the table before a couch, and the rest were in the kitchen cabinets. She flashed into her space and showed up before a kitchen cabinet, then opened it and took out five glasses.</p> <p>She was able to hold five glasses, but not five glasses of water. Therefore, she turned to shout at Mengmeng.</p> <p>“Did you finish? Give that bailer to me if you have.”</p> <p>With that, Mengmeng handed the bailer to her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took it over and re-entered her space, then came back out soon. When she was out, the bailer was filled with lake water.</p> <p>She squatted and put the glasses on the ground. Then, she filled the glasses with water one after another and handed them to the group of zombies.</p> <p>Lin Qiao let each of them drink three glasses of water, then told them to take the glasses away.</p> <p>“You can’t break your glasses. If your glasses are broken, don’t come back to me for more water!”</p>",
  "Chapter 279: They’re Healing": "<p>The five zombies left with their treasured glasses, and only Mengmeng stayed beside Lin Qiao, staring at the bailer in her hands.</p> <p>“… Here you go!” said Lin Qiao. After throwing the red bailer to Mengmeng, she turned and went downstairs.</p> <p>On the sixth floor, she saw Tong Tong and Lin Xiaolu running about in the corridor, playing with Xie Dong. Liu Jun was sitting on a chair by the door of her room, watching the three. However, Lin Qiao didn’t see Cheng Wangxue. Normally, she was always with Lin Xiaolu.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao came down, Liu Jun dropped the book in her hands and asked Lin Qiao, “You’ve spent a few days on the roof. Have you tamed those zombie leaders? How’s Lili?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to Junjun and leaned against the wall, crossing her arms before her chest. She shook her head and said, “It wasn’t hard to tame those zombie leaders that Lili brought back, but the one at the same level as Lili was a little difficult. I can’t handle her for now. But, I think Lili is able to suppress her completely. She’s in my space now. I just asked Viney to fix and activate her body. I don’t know how long it’ll take.”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded and responded, “I felt that the vibes of the two zombies you just brought out of your space are different now. Your lake water is getting more and more effective. Is it related to Viney’s upgrade?”</p> <p>“Em,” Lin Qiao nodded and replied.</p> <p>At that moment, she saw that Lin Xiaolu had stopped running abruptly, turning to look at her with confusion before slowly walking toward her.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?” Seeing the little girl walking to her, Lin Qiao smiled and asked.</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu walked up to Lin Qiao and spent a short while staring at her stomach, then raised her head to look at the latter’s face with her large eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with surprise. She found that she wasn’t able to sense Lin Xiaolu’s thoughts anymore, not even when they were close to each other. She guessed that it was because the latter now had spirit power. Her power might have blocked Lin Qiao’s sensation, and it should be some kind of self-protection.</p> <p>“Aren’t you in pain?” Lin Xiaolu asked. Once she said that, Liu Jun and Xie Dong both looked at Lin Qiao confusedly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao blinked, then squatted and smiled at Lin Xiaolu while answering her question, “Don’t worry, I’m not in pain. The one you sensed isn’t me. It’s someone else.”</p> <p>“Not you?” Lin Xiaolu’s eyes were filled with puzzlement. She abruptly pressed a hand on Lin Qiao’s forehead, then thought for a while and asked another question, “Is it your space? There are two people in your space. Are they fighting?”</p> <p>Liu Jun and Xie Dong glanced at each other, then both turned to Lin Xiaolu with surprise.</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu’s power actually allowed her to sense the insides of Lin Qiao’s space. The little girl was unexpectedly powerful.</p> <p>“No,” said Lin Qiao, “They aren’t fighting. They’re healing.”</p> <p>“Okay…” Lin Xiaolu nodded without fulling understanding.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rubbed her head and said to her, “Go and play.”</p> <p>In fact, Lin Xiaolu’s sensations were rather keen. Earlier on, she sensed Lin Qiao when the latter was still three meters away. She would become incredibly powerful in the future when her power upgraded to a certain level.</p> <p>“We’re going down. It’s almost dinner time,” Lin Xiaolu shook her head and said to Lin Qiao. Then, she turned to Tong Tong and continued, “Tong Tong, let’s go downstairs for dinner.”</p> <p>“Alright…” Hearing the word ‘dinner’, Tong Tong immediately agreed and walked toward Lin Xiaolu.</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu held his hand, then they walked toward the stairs together, with Xie Dong following behind the two kids.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched Lin Xiaolu walking before Tong Tong like a little adult. She seemed to be looking after Tong Tong carefully. After Xie Dong and the two kids left, Lin Qiao turned to look at Liu Jun, who continued sitting on the chair.</p> <p>“Is Tong Tong eating with them now?”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded and said, “Yeah… Madam said that they all eat together anyway. She also said that it was inconvenient for me to cook for Tong Tong alone, and that it’ll be better for them to prepare Tong Tong’s food. Tong Tong eats like a bird, and the two kids can eat more than usual when eating together. So, I agreed.”</p> <p>“I don’t need to eat anyway,” she spread her hands and continued, “It’s indeed inconvenient for me to prepare a tiny amount of food for the kid every day.”</p> <p>She was pretty diligent before, but now, she was actually getting a little lazy.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed her thoughts and said, “You felt inconvenient because you’re getting lazy, right?”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Qiu Lili stayed in the lake for three days before finally making some noise. Lin Qiao had been paying attention to the lake the whole time. On the third day, she finally sensed a strong wave of energy from the lake.</p> <p>She flashed into her space and stood by the lakeside, watching the small swirl in the middle of the lake which was caused by the energy from the center of the lake. Quite a while later, she saw countless jade-white vines reach out of the water through the swirl, dancing in the air.</p> <p>After that, a vibe from the lake suddenly made her feel repressed. The vibe slowly grew stronger, and so did the repressing feeling; so much so that she felt hard to breathe.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Qiu Lili didn’t directly break into level-seven, did she?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao remained standing by the lakeside, fighting against the repressing feeling with a frown. However, she started failing in just a few seconds. An intention of running far away from this place was rising from her heart.</p> <p>Thankfully, right before she gave up and turned to exit her space, the vibe suddenly disappeared. Then, the swirl in the middle of the lake slowly faded.</p> <p>Viney’s vines calmed down as well, all drawing back into the water. Lin Qiao sighed in relief, as she knew that Qiu Lili had finally woken up.</p> <p>A while later, she saw Qiu Lili stick her head out of the water, slowly swimming toward the lakeside. As Qiu Lili got closer and closer to her, Lin Qiao found something to not be quite right.</p> <p>Qiu Lili was still in the water, but Lin Qiao had seen her over a meter long hair which were floating behind her!</p> <p>Before, Qiu Lili’s hair only reached her waist. But now, her hair could almost reach her feet! Lin Qiao’s hair had all fallen off, but Qiu Lili’s didn’t. On the contrary, her hair even grew longer!</p> <p>Lin Qiao suddenly felt that she needed to talk to Viney about life.</p> <p>Qiu Lili, who now had super long hair, slowly stood up from the water. She covered her chest with an arm while walking toward the chair beside Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched her approaching and asked, “You… Did you upgrade?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili glanced at her confusedly, then thought for a moment before nodding.</p> <p>“I think… so… Eh? I can talk!” As she opened her mouth, a clear sentence escaped her lips. Hearing her own voice, she stopped walking. Then, the confused look in her face was replaced by a look of joy. She popped her blood-red eyes and stared at Lin Qiao happily.</p> <p>“Ah, I can talk! I can talk!”</p> <p>She was so happy that she even forgot to put clothes on. Lin Qiao looked at her and smiled before responding, “Alright, I get it. It was meant to happen, wasn’t it? Hurry, come up and put your clothes on.”</p> <p>Only after hearing Lin Qiao’s words did Qiu Lili realize that she was still naked.</p>",
  "Chapter 280: I Want to Talk to You": "<p>As Qiu Lili ran away to dress herself, Lin Qiao shouted at the lake, “Viney, come here. I want to talk to you!”</p> <p>Hearing her, a few jade-white vines immediately rose from the lake and reached to Lin Qiao before wrapping around her wrist.</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted and said, “Let me ask you a question. Why did all my hair fall off when I upgraded, but Lili’s grew so much longer when she upgraded?”</p> <p>She glanced back at Qiu Lili’s long, black, shiny hair, then turned to look at the vine on her hand.</p> <p><em>‘Em… I don’t know… I can’t control that… Maybe… Mama, maybe your hair will grow too when you’re at her level…’</em></p> <p>“Level?” asked Lin Qiao, “Is it about level? Not every zombie will have their hair grow crazily when reaching level-seven, right?”</p> <p><em>‘I don’t know if the others are the same… Maybe only Sister Lili can grow hair… Or, maybe the others will also have their hair fall off, just like Mama…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “You see, Junjun’s hair didn’t fall off. No one else will become bald like me, right?”</p> <p>Viney stayed silent for a while, as if she was thinking hard. Then, she said, <em>‘But Mama, your body was damaged badly. To activate your body, I needed to reform all of it.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was puzzled at first, then asked with surprise, “What? You haven’t activated my body yet? But, I’m already able to talk, am I not?”</p> <p><em>‘That’s because I’ve fixed and reformed your throat, </em>‘ said Viney <em>, ‘Mama’s throat wasn’t damaged.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and responded, “Is that so? Alright!”</p> <p><em>‘Mama, Mama </em>,’ Viney continued regretfully, <em>‘I’ve used up all the energy in helping Sister Lili upgrade. I can’t upgrade Mama now…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao carelessly shook her head and said, “It’s alright. I’ll just get you more energy nuclei. You’re tired. Just go take some rest.”</p> <p>She had felt that Viney was a little weak.</p> <p><em>‘Alright, </em>‘ Viney replied obediently. Then, she unwrapped Lin Qiao’s wrist and drew back into the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the lake. The density of the energy contained in the lake water had grown much higher than before. Lin Qiao guessed that all that energy was filtered by Viney.</p> <p>She turned back to look at Qiu Lili. The latter had dried her hair with her fire power, and was now fighting against those super long hair. The hair were too long, and she wasn’t used to them. Now, she just didn’t know how to tie her hair up.</p> <p>The hair at such a length could be tied into twin tails, but that was indeed not an easy thing to do.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wasn’t good at hair-managing either. So, she spread her hands and said to Qiu Lili, “Maybe you should go out and ask Junjun for help. I don’t know how to tie up such long hair either…”</p> <p>Qiu Lili paused slightly, then looked at her helplessly while pouting and said, “Why are they so long? Why did yours fall off but mine became twice as long?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao noticed that Qiu Lili’s voice was even sweeter and more silvery than it used to be, unlike her own dry and unpleasant voice.</p> <p>Was it really because Qiu Lili was at a higher level?</p> <p>Lin Qiao held Qiu Lili’s hand, then both of them flashed out of the space.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Liu Jun, Xie Dong, even Mengmeng had all been waiting for them to come out. Once Qiu Lili showed up, Mengmeng, who stayed on the roof, suddenly appeared on the windowsill of Liu Jun’s room.</p> <p>“Roar?”</p> <p>‘Lili?’</p> <p>Seeing Qiu Lili who was now with draped hair, Mengmeng called her name with uncertainty.</p> <p>Liu Jun’s eyes glowed for some reason when she saw Qiu Lili’s long and straight hair reaching straight to the ground, as smooth as a waterfall.</p> <p>“Wow, your hair are so beautiful!”</p> <p>Seeing Liu Jun’s glowing eyes, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but want to laugh. Liu Jun acted like a kid who had spotted some kind of interesting toy!</p> <p>“Yeah, they grew longer. They are too long… Can I cut them short?” Qiu Lili said with a clear and sweet voice.</p> <p>She wanted to cut her hair short. However, after seeing the look in Liu Jun’s eyes, she felt that it would be wrong for her to cut her hair without the latter’s permission.</p> <p>“No!” As she thought, Liu Jun shouted out loud, then hurriedly ran up to her and lifted her hair. While stroking the hair, she continued, “It’ll be such a shame to cut off these beautiful hair. Don’t cut them, I’ll tie them up for you. You can have any style you like.”</p> <p>Xie Dong looked at Lin Qiao confusedly, who spread her hands toward him.</p> <p>Sometimes, guys just couldn’t understand girls’ obsession with hair.</p> <p>On seeing Qiu Lili’s super long hair, Liu Jun even ignored the level-seven vibe from her. Even though the latter had fully restrained her vibe on purpose, the pressure from a higher level being should still be strong for Liu Jun, as she was so close to Qiu Lili at the moment.</p> <p>Mengmeng stood aside, looking at Qiu Lili. After confirming the latter’s identity, she sat on the windowsill with her back to the outside, swaying her lower legs.</p> <p>Lili had become further stronger than her. She wasn’t able to defeat Lili before, and now, she had even smaller chance. She guessed that Lili was now able to send her flying away with a single slap.</p> <p>How did Lili become so powerful? Was it because of Lin Qiao? Could she grow stronger like Lili did?</p> <p>Mengmeng looked at Qiu Lili, then turned to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>She had a feeling that Lin Qiao must have something to do with Qiu Lili’s sudden upgrade. After all, the two of them disappeared together earlier on, and now showed up together. Once they were out, she found that Lili had become much stronger than before!</p> <p>However, she didn’t wonder for long, as she was soon distracted by Tong Tong, who was sleeping in the bed.</p> <p>Qiu Lili said to Liu Jun, “I want them to be like before, but they are too long now…” While speaking, she wore a struggling face. Liu Jun immediately made her sit on the chair, then brought the comb and hair strings out of her room while saying, “Watch me do it. I’ll teach you.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Tong Tong, who was taking a nap, then turned to Mengmeng, who was gazing at him with sparkling eyes. “This is Tong Tong,” she said to Mengmeng, “You can’t take him away without permission like you did before! Also, you can’t hurt him! Do you understand?”</p> <p>She detected no evil intention from Mengmeng’s eyes, but she was worried that the latter might accidentally hurt Tong Tong.</p> <p>At that moment, Qiu Lili suddenly turned back to yell at Mengmeng fiercely, “I’ll kill you if you dare to hurt Tong Tong.”</p> <p>Mengmeng looked at Qiu Lili and flinched, shaking her head quickly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao smilingly watched the two of them. Qiu Lili was like Mengmeng’s invincible opponent! As long as Lili was here, Lin Qiao wouldn’t need to worry that Mengmeng might become unruly.</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao looked at Qiu Lili and couldn’t help but feel lucky for the fact that her humanity had stayed, and that she was a kind soul. She was so powerful now! If she picked the side of evil, she would become a real disaster.</p> <p>She wondered if any other zombie dominators existed in this world. There were so many zombies now, and it was possible for them to evolve into second-grade zombie kings and queens, also known as zombie dominators. Maybe zombie dominators did exist, but no one had encountered any yet.</p> <p>Lin Qiao believed that there were more zombie dominators in this world. However, she didn’t want to meet any of them except for Qiu Lili!</p>",
  "Chapter 281: The Number of Zombies": "<p>Liu Jun quickly braided Qiu Lili’s hair and curled them slightly, then tied them up into twin-tails, hanging behind her body.</p> <p>The dark circles under Qiu Lili’s eyes had disappeared. Her eyes were still black, and her pupils were fiery-red. The skin of her face and body had become white and smooth. Wearing the white dress, she still looked very adorable.</p> <p>Qiu Lili flipped her super long twin-tail and felt not so bad. So, she became happy again.</p> <p>Liu Jun asked Lin Qiao, “Eh? Did Viney use up all the energy contained in the nuclei that Lili brought back this time? Didn’t you ask Viney to give you another treatment, to see if your hair could grow back out?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “Viney said that the energy has been consumed up. Lili is at a high level, so she required a great amount of energy to fix her body. Fortunately, she brought back enough nuclei. If there was even one less, she might not have been able to upgrade.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>More days passed by. These days, Lin Qiao had been training the seven zombies—five zombie leaders and two level-four superpowered zombies. In order to call them more conveniently, Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili numbered them. Now, they called them directly by the numbers.</p> <p>Zombie number one wasn’t the strongest one, but was the one who was the most obedient to Lin Qiao, and number two was the second most obedient one.</p> <p>So, reasonably, the two level-four zombies, who were the weakest ones among them all, became number one and two. The male zombie was number one, while the female zombie was number two. The male zombie had a lower IQ than the female, but he was tractable. The female zombie was smart indeed, but Lin Qiao felt that she liked to play petty tricks and considered herself to be very clever. Moreover, she was very violent…</p> <p>When Lin Qiao taught her how to dress herself, she tore half of the shirt off; when Lin Qiao asked her to pick up things, she picked up a pile of good and bad things. The funniest thing was that Lin Qiao could tell that she understood the order, but still decided to bring the bad things back, as she guessed that a big quantity might bring her compliments.</p> <p>Sometimes, Lin Qiao found this female zombie to be both funny and annoying.</p> <p>The middle-aged male zombie who was beaten up by Lin Qiao was zombie number three. After being beaten and having a cup of water that Lin Qiao provided, he became very obedient to her. He didn’t remember what happened before, as if the debts between him and Lin Qiao had been canceled completely.</p> <p>The boy zombie was zombie number four, the female zombie leader was zombie number five, the male zombie leader was zombie number six, and the elderly zombie was number seven.</p> <p>The elderly zombie had kept some habits that he had before death. Lin Qiao felt that he used to be someone with a very strong self-awareness. She guessed that he was a government official, or the leader of a large family… or the godfather of the underworld.</p> <p>Zombie number seven had an old habit, that when drinking water, he had to find a chair to sit down. If there wasn’t a chair around him when Lin Qiao gave him the water, he would hold the glass and look around. Only after finding a chair of a couch would he sit down and drink the water sip by sip.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wondered if he thought the water was booze or tea.</p> <p>As a part of the training content, Lin Qiao made them memorize the human beings who were staying in this area. Of course, in their eyes, those humans were all preys and food.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao brainwashed them every day… Yes, she brainwashed them!</p> <p>She not only made them memorize the scent of every human being who lived in the hotel building, but also demanded them to memorize their names. The zombies had no idea what names were, so Lin Qiao explained to them that people called each other by different names… She felt like she was teaching a group of elementary school students.</p> <p>Thankfully, all zombie leaders were quite smart. They didn’t understand at first, but as Lin Qiao explained two or three times, they had mostly gotten her meaning.</p> <p>At last, Lin Qiao strongly demanded these zombies to not hurt people. Apart from that, she also required them to protect the people who lived in the hotel building.</p> <p>But of course, while ordering these zombies to not hurt people, she also told them to stay away from strangers. Otherwise, it would be bad if they refused to hurt people because of what she said, but ended up being killed after accidentally exposing themselves to strangers.</p> <p>At last, Lin Qiao gave them a final direction–they weren’t allowed to hurt anyone, unless someone hurt them! And of course, if anyone attacked them, they should fight back with the same level of attack.</p> <p>Then, those zombies were confused by the term ‘same level of attack’. To explain, Lin Qiao gave some examples.</p> <p>In addition to the above, Lin Qiao also asked them to think of this area as their territory. No outsiders were allowed in their territory. Lin Qiao forbade them from directly making a move when an unexpected situation occurred; instead, they always needed to report to her first.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had let the group of zombies know that any zombie who didn’t follow the rules would be executed… not by Qiu Lili, but by herself.</p> <p>Mengmeng was a special one. She kept a part of her humanity, but had lost all her memories. Also, she seemed to be a little mentally subnormal. She was half-good and half-evil.</p> <p>When happy, she was a good kid; but when upset, she was evil. And of course, when she lost her temper, she would turn into a monster!</p> <p>Lin Qiao hadn’t seen her going mad. No blood scent was detected from her body, judging by which, she didn’t seem to have killed any human.</p> <p>If that weren’t the case, Lin Qiao wouldn’t have let Qiu Lili show mercy to her.</p> <p>Furthermore, Lin Qiao found that Mengmeng was especially interested in children. Earlier on, she acted like she had attained some kind of treasure after seeing Wu Yueling. She was happy on seeing Tong Tong as well. At last, she started playing with Lin Xiaolu.</p> <p>She didn’t approach Lin Xiaolu. Instead, the latter came to her.</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu found that she was able to communicate with Mengmeng after getting close to her for the first time. At that time, she had to sneakily approach Mengmeng to talk to her, because Lin Qiao had told Lin Feng and the others to keep an eye on Mengmeng and stay away from her, as she was powerful and a bit unruly.</p> <p>Therefore, people were shocked that day upon finding that Lin Xiaolu had gotten close to Mengmeng when the adults weren’t noticing. Fortunately, the two of them got along well, and nothing bad happened.</p> <p>Another thing was that Lin Qiao had upgraded the appearances of each zombie. As for the boy zombie’s scary-looking wounded mouth, Lin Qiao had asked her to cover it with bandages. She only allowed him to take off the bandages while drinking his daily water. For the rest of the time, the boy zombie looked like a severely wounded child.</p> <p>Currently, those zombies would only take in the lake water that Lin Qiao provided, but not any food. The lake water was able to ease their hunger and repair their bodies from the inside, very slowly though.</p> <p>On this day, Lin Qiao was teaching the boy zombie how to write. The boy zombie overreacted each time he saw notebooks and pens, maybe because he was violently forced to study by her parents back in the old world. As he didn’t know how to hold a pen, it was difficult for him to even draw, let alone write.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao would teach him how to read and write when she had time.</p>",
  "Chapter 282: Coming Across Man-eating Robbers Again": "<p>Lin Qiao, who was on the roof teaching the boy zombie how to write, suddenly felt something before someone showed up by her side. That was the elderly zombie, zombie number seven.</p> <p>“Roar…” The elderly zombie’s deep voice was heard.</p> <p>‘People there.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao had told the group of zombies to not call humans ‘preys’, but ‘people’ instead. So, the elderly zombie used those two words to report what he had sensed to her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was puzzled at first, then raised her head to find that he was holding a hand behind his body, the other hand pointing at the area that he had been guarding.</p> <p>That was the way to Sea City.</p> <p>Lin Qiao closed her eyes and tried to sense, but felt nothing. Afterward, she stood up with her eyes closed as she sniffed deeply at the air toward that direction.</p> <p>Two minutes later, she opened her eyes which glowed slightly.</p> <p>She thought that Yuan Tianxing and his people might be back, but upon sniffing carefully, she found that those people were a group of strangers. She didn’t detect the scents of Yuan Tianxing, Du Yuanxing, and the other few.</p> <p>“Grandpa, go stop them,” she said to zombie number seven, “Remember, scare them off, but don’t hurt them… Eh, wait!”</p> <p>She had planned to send the elderly zombie to scare those people away and make them avoid this area. For some reason, she felt it would be better to not let Lin Feng and the others meet those people.</p> <p>However, before she finished talking, she sensed another group of people behind the first group.</p> <p><em>‘Alright, two batches of people. In this case, we need to figure out what’s happening first.’</em></p> <p>“Let’s go there and take a look,” Lin Qiao stood up and leaped from the roof with the elderly and the boy zombie. She wanted to know who those people were and what they were doing!</p> <p>Mengmeng watched Lin Qiao and the two zombie leaders leaving. She didn’t follow them out of curiosity, as Qiu Lili didn’t do it.</p> <p>Sensing that Lin Qiao and the two zombie leaders were leaving, Lin Feng, who was in his room, curiously glanced at their backs. Mrs. Lin noticed his expression, so she asked, “What’s wrong?”</p> <p>Lin Feng turned back and replied, “Lu Tianyu and two zombie leaders left. I don’t know what they’re going to do.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin nodded and said, “Ah, I guess they just need to do something.”</p> <p>Lin Feng silently turned to look out of the window.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and the two zombie leaders swiftly leaped over the zombie crowd, then quietly approached the two groups of people.</p> <p>At that moment, a dozen people were moving forward about two miles away. They were all armed to the teeth, each of them having at least ten guns and countless bullets. They were heading toward where Lin Qiao was. On their way, they shot every zombie they saw.</p> <p>Every single bullet of theirs put down a zombie, not one going wasted.</p> <p>While getting close to those people, Lin Qiao turned herself invisible. She asked zombie number four and zombie number seven to keep an eye on those people from a distance away while she moved closer sneakily.</p> <p>When she finally saw the first group of people clearly, she couldn’t help but knit her brows into a frown. The dozen men didn’t look like good people at all. Every single one of them was radiating a strong scent of blood, their eyes filled with craziness, cruelty, and bloodlust.</p> <p>What made Lin Qiao frown wasn’t how fierce they looked, but the fact that they were with three captives.</p> <p>Those were two male captives and a female one. The two men looked very young, about eighteen or nineteen years old. The female looked a little older, around twenty.</p> <p>The first group of people didn’t seem to have been chased, as they weren’t alarmed at all. On the contrary, they all look pleased with themselves.</p> <p>Their vibes were familiar to Lin Qiao, as she had sensed that kind of vibe before.</p> <p>Yes, if she were right, the dozen men in front of her were all post-apocalyptic robbers. The three captives would probably end up as their food.</p> <p>They were in a villa area. The villas in this place weren’t high-end, but were all detached, two-story villas. Lin Qiao stood on top of a very tall tree, looking at the dozen men violently dragging the three captives into a detached villa. At this point, the three captives’ clothes had all been ragged. Lin Qiao was able to guess what they had been through.</p> <p>Women were rare in the post-apocalyptic era. Even many people in the bases weren’t able to fulfill their desires, not to mention those robbers who needed to fight their way out of zombie crowds every day.</p> <p>Therefore, men vented their desires on each other sometimes. Of course, the youngest or weakest among a group would become the target.</p> <p>However, robbers rarely did that to their own people. Normally, their objects would be the people that they robbed. They wouldn’t let go of women or young and pretty men.</p> <p>When they got tired of those captives or accidentally killed them, they would cut them into pieces and eat them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao counted the group of robbers. There were twelve of them, all at a relatively high level. No wonder they had been acting calmly and confidently.</p> <p>The invisible Lin Qiao walked straight to the front gate of the villa, then hopped onto the two-meters-tall fence wall.</p> <p>The two robbers who guarded by the door didn’t sense Lin Qiao’s entry at all. They were even chatting pretty leisurely.</p> <p>“I think that long-haired man is juicy. He’s tall and slim, with slender limbs. His skin is good too, feels so damn great! Sadly, he wore out soon. It has only been two days, but he’s already half-dead. Well, he’s dying, hm.”</p> <p>“The rude one is not bad either. He’s strong and provocative. Only this kind of people can give you the sense of conquest. That’s how you can feel good. That long-haired one is too sissy. Not my type anyway.”</p> <p>“Well, we just have different tastes. I like pretty boys, but you like the stronger ones. I know it, hehe…”</p> <p>“I sure do. The long-haired one is too skinny, and he’s too easy to break! But, Boss is so lucky this time. He actually got us a woman. I haven’t touched a woman’s soft tits in five years!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao calmly listened to their conversation, a coldness developing in her eyes. The contents of this conversation were unexpected.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she sighed silently over the current reality of this world. Power was the only principle now. The weaker ones would either end up dead or humiliated. It was like a primitive society.</p> <p>She jumped into the villa, then walked through the front yard to the door, which was guarded by two robbers as well. She walked into the villa and saw that a few men were cleaning the place roughly. The three captives were tied up and thrown into a corner.</p> <p>None of the three seemed to be in a good mental state. Their faces were all filled with despair and numbness. Judging by their body conditions, the woman seemed to have been treated slightly gently than the two men, as no obvious injuries were found on her body except for the red marks on her cheeks, which were clearly caused by heavy slaps.</p> <p>Her clothes were in a mess. Her shirt was ripped open, and the breasts were half exposed. At this time, she had lowered her head, curling in the corner.</p> <p>The two young men weren’t doing as good as she was. They were both covered in wounds, such that even the corners of their mouths were broken. Their faces were stained by blood. Their upper bodies were bared, as each one of them was only wearing a pair of pants.</p> <p>They were lying on the ground motionlessly with their eyes closed.</p>",
  "Chapter 283: He Felt that Something Wasn’t Right": "<p>About five or six men were in the living room, the rest having gone upstairs to check around.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found that these robbers were only carrying weapons, but not other things: no food or living supplies. She couldn’t tell if they had finished all the food, or if one of them had space power.</p> <p>Thinking of space power, Lin Qiao was reminded of the small space in her space.</p> <p>If a space-powered man did exist among these robbers, she wouldn’t hesitate to harvest him.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao was leaning against the wall and thinking, she saw that a few bottles of water suddenly appeared in a man’s hands.</p> <p>“Boss,” that man who suddenly had three bottles of water appearing in his hands shouted at the highest-leveled one, then threw a bottle of water at the latter.</p> <p>After that, he threw a bottle to another man.</p> <p>The man who was called Boss unscrewed the cap before taking a large gulp, then asked, “San, how much water do we have left?”</p> <p>The guy who threw him the water responded, “About a dozen bottles. We’ll draw those people here, then see how much water they have brought.”</p> <p>“Will they come here? What if they give up on chasing us?” said another man.</p> <p>“I think they will,” said Boss while putting the water bottle on a table. After that, he turned up the overturned couch and dusted it before sitting down and continuing, “This woman should be important for them. So, as long as she’s alive, I think they won’t give up. But of course, even if they did give up, we won’t lose anything, right?”</p> <p>He laughed while speaking.</p> <p>San held a bottle of water while nodding and saying, “Yeah, Boss, we need to keep this woman well, so we can have a way to channel our passion… Hah!”</p> <p>While talking, the few men turned to the women in the corner. Hearing them mentioning her, the woman automatically flinched.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the Boss man. He was wearing a pair of glasses and looking polite. However, the look in his eyes was nowhere near politeness. Even from meters away, she was able to sense the strong blood scent and evil hostility from him.</p> <p>San was a bald man. He was very fierce-looking, yet his vibe was the mildest among all.</p> <p>Another man called Er was incredibly handsome. He had a chiseled face and deeply sunken eyes. The calm look in his eyes was weirdly appealing.</p> <p>All three of them had strong superpowers, especially the Boss man. He had been making Lin Qiao feel a certain pressure.</p> <p>He was actually a level-seven superpowered man, while the other two were both at level-six.</p> <p>These people wouldn’t make Lin Qiao worry if she were alone. However, they were pretty close to Lin Feng and his people now, and that concerned her.</p> <p>“Boss,” said Er, “Do you think Yang will keep his word?”</p> <p>“Seventy percent,” Boss replied blandly, “He’s an ambitious man. Being on an equal footing with the other two has not been enough for him since long ago.”</p> <p>Er nodded and said, “You’re right! But, the one named Yuan Tianxing is only at level-six. What is there to be afraid of him for?”</p> <p>“Who is he? Why does Yang want us to kill them?” San asked confusedly while rubbing his bald head.</p> <p>Boss pushed his glasses slightly upward and bent over, elbows resting on knees, fingers crossed to support his chin. “I heard that he has dated the prettiest lady in Sea City Base, which made Yang unhappy,” he said carelessly, “So, Yang wants us to make him and his people disappear.”</p> <p>“We can do that for him if he lets us join the Sea City Base,” said Ear, “But, I want to know what Yang Chao plans to do to Wu Chengyue.” ,</p> <p>Boss laughed and responded, “He surely will start with that man’s weakness. Everybody knows about Wu Chengyue’s weakness—the little princess. Well, she’s too little now. If she were twelve, or even ten, it’d be nice to play with her.”</p> <p>Hearing his words, the other two reacted differently. San chuckled and said, “Boss, so you fancy young girls! I didn’t know that!”</p> <p>Unlike him, Er frowned slightly, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao, who stood beside them, had straightened her body with her eyes turning colder and colder.</p> <p>What did she hear? Such a coincidence! These people were after none other than Yuan Tianxing, who was her friend! And, the little one turned out to be living quite a risky life as well. Having a powerful Daddy was really not a good thing!</p> <p>“Are you sure that Yuan Tianxing is coming this way? Don’t get it wrong. It would be embarrassing if we missed him.”</p> <p>Boss nodded and said, “Yang Chao has sent his people to confirm the information. Apart from Yuan Tianxing and his people, another group of Hades Base people is out here. Those are the family members of the Hades Base leader.”</p> <p>Er stood by the couch with his arms crossed before his chest. He looked down at Boss and said, “Hades Base’s leader? Netherworld Fire? Her family escaped? Yang Jianhua is way too useless then. He can’t even catch a few fishes.”</p> <p>“Because Yang Jianhua has shown up in this area, Yang Chao believes that Netherworld Fire’s family is around here. This means that Yuan Tianxing was with them earlier. Perhaps, we’ll be able to find Netherworld Fire’s family before he returns. I heard that Netherworld Fire’s younger sister and sister-in-law are both pretty,” said Boss.</p> <p>“They have pretty women?” said San excitedly, “Boss, no wonder you came all the way here.”</p> <p>At that moment, Er suddenly paused, then turned around and scanned the living room for a few times. After that, he looked at the three captives. Seeing the look on his face, Boss and San both looked at him with confusion. “What’s wrong?” Boss asked.</p> <p>Er responded unsurely, “I don’t know… I had a bad feeling just now.” While speaking, he uncrossed his arms and turned to walk toward the door.</p> <p>“Jiu, Shi, have you noticed anything?” He walked to the door and asked the two men who were guarding outside. The two turned around and looked at him confusedly before one of them replied, “Eh? Nothing! Is anything wrong? If you’re talking about zombies, you should ask Qi and Ba. They’re on the roof.”</p> <p>Then, this man walked into the front yard and yelled at the roof, “Oi, Qi… is there a situation?”</p> <p>A man stuck out his head from the roof, looking down at him while responding, “Situation? I didn’t see anything but zombies. What’s wrong?”</p> <p>Jiu shook his head and said, “Nothing. Er seems to have felt something, so you should be careful.”</p> <p>The man on the roof gave him an OK sign, then left the roof edge.</p> <p>Er shook a hand to Jiu and said, “I’ll go out and look around. I still feel that something isn’t right.” While speaking, he walked out of the house, toward the gate.</p> <p>Lin Qiao coldly watched him walk out, then turned back to stare at the Boss man.</p>",
  "Chapter 284: Inhuman": "<p>There were two other people in the living room—Wu, who was leaning against the window near the three captives and smoking, and Si, who was checking the kitchen and bathrooms.</p> <p>After Er had left, San and Boss stopped talking. They both quieted down and began carefully looking around like Er just did.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at each of them. Er seemed to have the sharpest sensations among them all. She couldn’t tell what power Er had yet, but was almost sure that San had space power.</p> <p>Normally speaking, space-powered people were relatively weak. Since the bald San had space power, his fighting capacity should be no good. However, he was called ‘San’, meaning three. So, Lin Qiao wondered how they ranked themselves.</p> <p>“Wu, keep an eye on them,” Boss said to Wu. The latter put the cigarette between his lips and nodded before turning to the three captives in the corner. Lin Qiao understood that these people wouldn’t mention anything important now. Only after Er returned and confirmed that it was all clear would they start talking again.</p> <p>She turned around and walked out of the house, then quickly leaped over the fence wall and ran to hundreds of meters away to summon the boy zombie.</p> <p>She took out a piece of paper and a pen from her space, then wrote down a few words before handing the paper to the boy zombie, “Four, go back and give this to Lili. Don’t let anyone else see you. Go.”</p> <p>The boy zombie nodded and took over the piece of paper, then folded it and put it in his pocket. Then, he turned and ran fleetingly toward where Lin Feng and the others were. After that, Lin Qiao went back to the villa and began thinking about how to deal with that bald guy.</p> <p>Earlier on, she didn’t plan to make a move, as she thought that she would only be watching whatever was happening around here. However, what happened here was unexpected. Those robbers turned out to be going after Lin Feng and his people; and after finishing Lin Feng, they would try to hurt Yuan Tianxing as well.</p> <p><em>‘They’re coming at us, and they think that we don’t know yet, </em>‘ thought Lin Qiao. <em>‘In this case, whoever strikes first gains the advantage!’</em></p> <p>Er walked out of the gate and asked the two guards outside if they had noticed anything strange. As same as the man on the roof, the two also told him that they had seen nothing but zombies.</p> <p>“What? Is there a high-level zombie?” One of the two asked.</p> <p>Er scanned around with his sharp eyes, yet found nothing.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment, then abruptly saw the elderly zombie who was on the other side of the road. She immediately ran to him, then showed up beside him. She restrained her vibe as much as possible, then said to the elderly zombie, “Grandpa, gather the zombies nearby… the more the better. Let’s surround them!”</p> <p>“Roar?”</p> <p>‘Should I kill them?’ Grandpa looked at her and asked, seeming to be in deep thoughts.</p> <p>“Kill them,” said Lin Qiao, “Leave the bald guy to me. But, you need to be careful about the one wearing glasses. He’s powerful. Don’t become his target.”</p> <p>Grandpa clasped his hands behind his body and nodded, then disappeared from where he was.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then returned to the villa and stood behind the bald man. Right at that moment, a long and weird roar was heard from the outside.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that was Grandpa summoning ordinary zombies.</p> <p>“Eh? What happened? What’s that sound?” San asked curiously. He and the others had all heard that. The Boss blinked and said, “If I’m right, it should be a high-level zombie.”</p> <p>San’s eyes glowed. “High-level? Which level? Four? Five? It’ll be even better if it’s a level-six…” he said.</p> <p>“We only have three level-five zombie nuclei now,” said Boss, “But, we have quite some level-four nuclei. The nuclei we have can buy us quite some food from Yang Chao. So, if we get a level-six zombie nucleus, we can’t give it to him.”</p> <p>San paused slightly, then nodded and responded, “Alright! Let me check how many level-four nuclei we have.”</p> <p>While speaking, he closed his eyes. Three seconds later, he opened his eyes and said, “Boss, we have thirty-one level-four nuclei.”</p> <p>Boss nodded in response.</p> <p>Outside, Er showed a look of knowingness after hearing Grandpa’s roar. After that, he turned and walked back.</p> <p>“It should be fine. That high-level zombie seems to be the reason why I’m nervous. I just don’t know which level it’s at,” he said.</p> <p>“Alright!” The two by the gate nodded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t launch an attack, but walked to the three captives and sensed their life-force.</p> <p>The woman was fine, but the slim long-haired man was already at his last gasp. Four of his rib bones were broken, and so was his arm bone. Apart from that, his liver was slightly injured as well. The other man was in a better state. He wasn’t injured as badly as the long-haired one, but he still had a leg bone broken.</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted and reached out a hand to touch the two men’ foreheads, then sighed.</p> <p>Those two men had almost given up on survival.</p> <p>She pressed her hand on their foreheads and asked them in her mind, <em>‘Do you wanna live?’</em></p> <p>She repeated the question for a couple of times.</p> <p>She used to be a soldier. Back then, saving people was her duty. Now, she didn’t have that duty anymore, but her sense of responsibility remained. She wasn’t kind enough to be willing to save anyone, but what would be wrong if she saved some lives while fighting the bad guys?</p> <p>But at this point, she didn’t think that she could save the souls of these two men. She was able to heal their bodies with the lake water, but not their souls. She had repeated the question so many times, yet the two men gave no response at all. It seemed that they had both given up on their lives.</p> <p>Nevertheless, she had grasped some faint subconscious thoughts from the woman.</p> <p><em>‘Someone will certainly come to save me!’</em></p> <p>She repeated that over and over again to hypnotize herself, so she didn’t kill herself because of despair.</p> <p>At that moment, Wu suddenly walked over. Lin Qiao hurriedly stood up and stepped aside. Wu kicked the slim man, then turned to talk to Boss.</p> <p>“Boss, this kid will die in hours. Why don’t we cut him before he dies? He’ll taste bad after death.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao noticed that the women froze upon hearing Wu’s words.</p> <p>Boss turned to glance at Wu. However, before he said anything, Er walked in.</p> <p>“I think we should listen to Wu. His vitality will be gone after he died, and his flesh will taste awful.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao slightly widened her eyes and turned to stare at those people with disbelief. They wanted to cut this boy alive and eat him! These robbers had truly lost their humanity. They were no different from wild beasts.</p> <p>They talked about eating human beings like how people talked about eating animals back in the old world. Moreover, they refused to eat dead people, but wanted to eat someone alive!</p> <p>Boss nodded and said, “Then let’s build a fire to roast meat. We can cut him while roasting. He’ll taste better that way.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao clenched her fist, trying to calm herself down.</p> <p>She had decided to kill them all. Man-eating people were even more disgusting and terrifying than zombies. More importantly, these people were holding evil intentions toward Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing. She wasn’t able to kill the level-seven one now, but she could kill the others!</p>",
  "Chapter 285: Start Killing": "<p><em>‘You’re going after my people, so don’t blame me for taking your lives!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao turned and walked toward the two guarding by the gate. The gate was closed, so she leaped over the fence wall.</p> <p>The two didn’t detect her when she stood in front of them. Instead, they were looking around, as Er had just warned them that a large number of zombies might come to this area. So, they needed to be careful.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood between them and abruptly reached out her hands to grab them and drag them into her space. Before the two men realized what was happening, their eyes were dazzled. By the time they could see clearly, a claw had already sunk deep into their skulls.</p> <p>These two level-four superpowered men didn’t even manage to react before Lin Qiao killed them.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao suddenly showed up and brought the two men by the gate into her space, Er, who was in the living room, paused again. He suddenly turned to the door, then walked outside while wondering.</p> <p>“Jiu, go out and check on Shiyi and Shier.” While walking, he spoke to Jiu, who was guarding outside the door. Jiu nodded and walked out without saying a word.</p> <p>Lin Qiao threw the two bodies to the fringe of the woods, then flashed out. She stood behind the gate, hearing Jiu’s voice coming from the inside. “Shiyi, Shier, is everything okay out there?”</p> <p>Shiyi and Shier couldn’t answer his question.</p> <p>Jiu was puzzled slightly, so he continued, “Shiyi? Shier?”</p> <p>Once he called their names again, he got a bad feeling. He hurriedly opened the gate, but saw no one out there.</p> <p>He was shocked, immediately realized that something bad had happened. He turned back to shout at the villa, but just when he had opened his mouth wide, he disappeared from where he was.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spread her fingers, then clasped his head and dragged him directly into her space. Once in, she instantly put forth her strength through her fingers and inserted those fingers into that man’s head.</p> <p>“Eh… Eh…” Jiu popped his eyes while gazing at Lin Qiao with disbelief. His rifle dropped to the ground from his hands while a small amount of blood flowed out of his mouth, nose, eyes, and ears.</p> <p>However, he didn’t die immediately. Instead, he stared at Lin Qiao, unable to believe what he had seen. At last, fear emerged in his eyes.</p> <p>“You… Eh…”</p> <p>He raised a hand with some effort. He wanted to use his power, but found that he couldn’t. His power seemed to have disappeared. Well, it had not disappeared completely, but more like it had been weakened by ninety-nine percent.</p> <p>So, he wasn’t able to do anything with his power now.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t give him a chance to talk. Seeing that he was still alive, she clenched her fingers.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>Just like that, she crumbled his head, following which, Jiu’s body slowly fell to the ground. Lin Qiao glanced at her fingers. She didn’t have the time to wipe those fingers clean as she exited her space right away.</p> <p>This time, the look in Er’s face changed immediately. “On full alert!” He suddenly shouted out loud, “Everyone on full alert!”</p> <p>Hearing his words, all the others quickly raised their guns and looked around alarmedly. At the same time, the Boss walked out and saw the wide open gate. No one was around the gate.</p> <p>“Where’re Jiu, Shiyi and Shier?”</p> <p>Er shook his head and said, “Gone! No scent of blood. No scents at all.”</p> <p>The Boss stared at the gate while saying, “Gone? How’s it possible? Didn’t you find anything just now?”</p> <p>“I think it’s a zombie,” said Er, “This time, it’s a level-six space-powered zombie!”</p> <p>Boss glanced back at Er, then put his glasses slightly upward and said, “Are you saying that it can hide from our sensations while quietly bring three living human beings into its space and eating them?”</p> <p>Er looked around and nodded silently.</p> <p>A beam of light flashed across Boss’s glasses as he turned to look around as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood beside them. The dangerous feeling that she detected from Boss had grown stronger. It seemed that he had boosted his vibe.</p> <p>However, that didn’t affect Lin Qiao, but only made her feel threatened.</p> <p>She directly leaped onto the second floor from the outside, then stepped on the guardrail of the balcony and climbed onto the roof. Abruptly, Er thought of something. All of a sudden, he yelled at the two who were guarding on the roof, “Qi! Ba! Come down here!”</p> <p>When he shouted out loud, Lin Qiao was already standing behind Qi and Ba. She swiftly reached out a hand, gripped Qi’s neck, and brought him into her space.</p> <p>Just now, she discovered how pleasant it was to kill people inside her space! That was because she was able to sense how her space had been rejecting the powers of other superpowered beings. Just now, as Jiu prepared to attack with his power, Lin Qiao felt that something invisible had suddenly wrapped him up to stop him from activating his power.</p> <p>She didn’t know what that thing which wrapped Jiu up was; it wasn’t energy or air. She just had no idea!</p> <p>However, she understood that it was very helpful to her.</p> <p>This time, after dragging Qi in, she broke his neck quickly, neatly, and violently, making her killing very efficient! Ever since she became a zombie, human bones had been awfully fragile to her, as she was able to crush them with a slight effort.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>After throwing the fourth body to the edge of the woods, Lin Qiao went out again. At that moment, Ba was gazing at where Qi had disappeared, stunned. In the next moment, Lin Qiao showed up again on that spot.</p> <p>“Qi! Ba!” No one responded from the roof, so Er instantly had a bad feeling. He abruptly raised an arm, and a blood-red vine swished out of his palm, swinging up to the roof edge.</p> <p>He moved swiftly, and upon reaching the roof, the tip of the vine suddenly lunged at Ba and wrapped him tightly. Seeing Er’s blood vine, Ba immediately came back to his senses. Following the vine, he jumped off the roof.</p> <p>Then, the others all turned to Er, as only one man came down the roof.</p> <p>Er’s face darkened as he asked, “Ba, did you see anything?”.</p> <p>Ba calmed down and responded with a pale face, “Yes, it flashed across. I saw the back of a human… in a camouflage suit, bald… It should be a man.”</p> <p>At that moment, Er released five or six blood vines to wrap everyone else except the Boss.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Er with surprise. It turned out that he had green power. His blood vines looked quite dangerous.</p> <p>No wonder he had keen sensations. Green-powered people all seemed to be quite sensitive.</p> <p>“Are you sure it’s a man, and not a zombie?” said Er.</p> <p>Ba shook his head and replied, “I only saw his back. He disappeared within a second, so I don’t know if he’s a zombie or human!”</p>",
  "Chapter 286: Kill Them for Me": "<p>Lin Qiao looked at the six robbers who were all wrapped in Er’s blood vine, showing a cold look.</p> <p>Er believed that Lin Qiao wouldn’t be able to take them down one by one as long as he tied them all together. He was right though. However, Lin Qiao was able to bring them all into her space.</p> <p>Besides, she had Viney! Viney was her greatest weapon!</p> <p>At that moment, a series of roars could be heard from the outside, as a great number of zombies showed up, slowly approaching this area. Meanwhile, Lin Qiao moved to stand beside Er. Maybe because he was too vigilant or his level was too high, Lin Qiao wasn’t able to read his mind no matter how hard she tried.</p> <p>She glanced at the group of robbers, then flashed into her space.</p> <p>“Viney, come out!” She stood by the lake and called Viney’s name. Hearing her, Viney soon reached a few vines to the lakeside and wrapped around her wrist.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, Mama, did you miss me?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little speechless. Was Viney being affectionate to her?</p> <p>“Yes, I missed you!” she said, “Here, I need to talk to you. Later, I’ll bring a few bad guys in here. Can you kill them for me?”</p> <p><em>‘Eh?’ </em>said Viney with surprise, <em>‘Mama, you’ve killed quite a few just now. Are there more to kill? </em>‘</p> <p>“Yes,” said Lin Qiao, “I’m worrying that I might not be able to defeat them, as those people I’m about to bring in are too powerful.”</p> <p>Hearing that Viney immediately got excited. She wagged the vines in the middle of the lake while responding, <em>‘Mama, don’t be afraid. You just bring them in. I can directly absorb the energies at or below level-seven! Viney is powerful now! </em>‘</p> <p>“Level-seven?” Lin Qiao looked at Viney and said in surprise, “Can you kill level-seven superpowered human beings? Or even zombies?”</p> <p>“No…” said Viney, “I can kill all level-seven humans… but not zombies… Level-seven zombies aren’t at the same grade as level-seven humans.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, wondering if she could bring the Boss man in here.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then said to Viney, “Okay Viney, I’ll bring some people in here later. None of them is at level-seven, but two are at level-six. Leave the bald one for me. Don’t absorb his energy.”</p> <p>She was worried that Viney might turn the bald guy into a mummy, like what she did with Yang Cheng. If Viney forgot to leave her the bald guy’s energy nucleus, she wouldn’t be able to obtain her second small space.</p> <p><em>‘Sure, sure </em>,’ Viney replied.</p> <p><em>‘Alright, I’m going out now. Wait for me </em>,’ Lin Qiao said to her before turning and flashing out of her space.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Outside, the group of robbers were staring at the gate. Boss pushed his glasses slightly upward while saying, “They’re here.”</p> <p>A giant crowd of zombies had shown up outside the gate. By now, they were rushing at those robbers while roaring.</p> <p>Back in the old world, this place was a remote villa area. This area was never densely populated, so there shouldn’t be so many zombies nearby. Boss guessed that this zombie crowd was brought here by a high-level zombie, which should be a zombie king or queen.</p> <p>“The space-powered zombie seems to be a zombie king or queen,” he said, “While capturing us one by one, it summoned all these zombies from further areas.”</p> <p>“Boss, I can’t feel it!” said Er, sounding a little depressed. He had always been good at sensing. But now, a zombie had been showing up around him from time to time, yet he felt nothing at all!</p> <p>That was like a slap right on his face.</p> <p>Boss glanced at him and wore a sullen look as well. “Everybody, be careful!” he said. “It’ll definitely spend a while if it tries to cut off Er’s blood vines to capture you. That span of time will be enough for you to fight back!”</p> <p>“Yes, Sir!”</p> <p>“Copy!”</p> <p>The others looked around carefully, all on full alert.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took a slight step toward Boss. However, as she was about a meter away from him, and prepared to reach out her hand, Boss suddenly turned to look where she was.</p> <p><em>‘This is bad </em>!’ She said to herself while noticing the gleam of light flashing across his eyes. She hurriedly took back her hand, then moved away as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Then, she saw Boss swiftly swing his arm and sending a wave of metal blades to where she was standing a second ago.</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p> <p>Over a hundred two-feet-long, inch-wide blades fell from the sky and pierced into the ground. If Lin Qiao hadn’t dodged fast enough, at least twenty of these blades would have sunken into her body.</p> <p>She was invisible, yet her body didn’t merge with the air. She still wasn’t able to go through walls. She couldn’t touch people either, because if she did, they would feel her.</p> <p>Watching the metal blades stick into the ground, the Boss showed a grim expression. Just now, he did feel that something was in that area, and was pretty close to him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood aside calmly while looking at him. By now, she had learned about this level-seven superpowered man’s range of sense toward her invisible state. Once the distance between him and her was shorter than a meter, he would be able to sense her. So, she wasn’t able to bring him into her space while he wasn’t noticing.</p> <p>Fighting him would be impossible. She might have a chance to win against a level-six superpowered man, but fighting a level-seven one would be suicidal for her.</p> <p>She turned to look at the others. As same as Boss, they had all been staring at those metal blades which were halfway inside the ground now.</p> <p>Then, she avoided the others and walked toward the bald guy.</p> <p>She stood before the bald guy, watched him look around in a panic. Abruptly, she curved her lips and showed a wicked smile. Next, she raised a hand to clasp San’s bald head, then whispered two words to herself.</p> <p>‘All in!’</p> <p>In the next moment, Boss’s eyes were dazzled, as everyone else on the scene disappeared all of a sudden.</p> <p>In the space, Viney, who was waiting by the lake, reached out countless vines to tie the group of robbers up even before they realized what was happening.</p> <p>“Ah… Where is this place!”</p> <p>“I… I can’t move!”</p> <p>“What is this place! Power… I can’t use my power!”</p> <p>As the world before their eyes suddenly changed, the group of robbers panicked immediately.</p> <p>Er’s blood vines slowly fell off from their bodies. Seeing that, Er was slightly flurried as well. While looking around, he tried to control his power and rip off the white vines wrapping around his body.</p> <p>He saw a lake. He was standing by the lakeside, and those white wines were emerging from the lake. Apart from that, he knew nothing.</p> <p>However, as the vice-captain, he soon calmed down. Before long, he found that even though the vines had wrapped him tightly up, they didn’t try to drag him and his friends into the lake. Besides, there were no thorns on the white vines. So, as long as their skin wasn’t broken, the chance of being poisoned would be small.</p>",
  "Chapter 287: All In": "<p>Lin Qiao stood behind the bald guy without moving, but quietly looking at this group of people. She was shorter than the bald man, so no one saw her in the first few seconds. But soon, she was spotted by those robbers.</p> <p>“You… Who are you!”</p> <p>“No! She isn’t a human! Look at her eyes! Her eyes are all black! She’s a zombie!”</p> <p>“She is… Er! She must be the space-powered zombie queen that Boss mentioned!”</p> <p>Some of them were still holding their guns. The ones whose hands weren’t tied by Viney immediately fired at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>A series of gunshots was heard.</p> <p>Lin Qiao moved swiftly to dodge the bullets which were sent toward her by three people while giving Viney a shout.</p> <p>“Viney, move!”</p> <p>Following her voice, the group of people felt that the vines wrapped around their bodies suddenly tighten, even seeming to break their bones. What made them pop their eyes shock was the words they heard just now. The zombie talked! It gave an order!</p> <p>The vines tied them up so tight that they could barely breathe. At that moment, they had nothing but questions in their heads.</p> <p>Wasn’t that a zombie? Why was the zombie able to talk!</p> <p>But soon, they couldn’t continue thinking about those questions because the vines wrapped them up from the feet to their necks and squeezed them violently, causing them a pain that stopped them from breathing. They felt that all their internal organs were about to be crushed.</p> <p>“Ah…”</p> <p>“Ahhh…”</p> <p>Except for Er and San, the others all burst into screams, their faces twisted. They were all blushing because of suffocation, their eyes bulged while veins stood out under the skin of their temples.</p> <p>Er and San were in great pain as well, but they suffered less than the others. After all, even though they weren’t able to attack with their powers, their powers had still been protecting their bodies from being harmed.</p> <p>Therefore, they only had their faces turn red, but made no other reactions. But of course, they couldn’t move either.</p> <p>At that moment, a vine tip rose from each of them, reaching much higher than their heads.</p> <p>The pair of cute little leaves on each vine tip folded together, then the leaf tips turned slightly before magically forming a sharp thorn and slowly approaching the temples of everyone except the bald guy.</p> <p>Just like that, the thorns quietly pierced into their heads while they were still struggling.</p> <p>“Ah…”</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>A series of shrill scream could be heard, filled with pain.</p> <p>Er and San were startled by those screams. They widened their eyes and turned to look at their friends, then saw the leaves on the vine tips puncturing into their friends’ temples. Immediately, the looks in their faces changed. They watched their friends’ faces twisted in pain and heard them howl. Then, as the white vine drilled into their right temples, they stopped screaming, but the expression on their faces remained.</p> <p>Before long, the vine tips pulled themselves out, having turned blood-red.</p> <p>Er abruptly turned his head to look around his head. As he had thought, a similar vine tip was pointing at his temple. Seeing that, he instantly began shaking his head in fright.</p> <p>“Ah! No! I don’t want to die! No…”</p> <p>But soon, Viney drilled into his temple.</p> <p>“Eh…”</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao had already raised her hand and put her sharp nails against San’s scalp.</p> <p>“You’ve been eating people. Had you thought that you’d end up being eaten as well one day?” she spoke blandly.</p> <p>San was in complete terror. He tried to turn around, but couldn’t move his body. He managed to turn around his head, yet only saw Lin Qiao’s face from the side.</p> <p>Then, he felt that something sharp had pierced into his head.</p> <p>“No, no, no… wait a minute… Please don’t kill me… Please don’t kill me… Eh… Ah…”</p> <p>As he begged for mercy, Lin Qiao impatiently inserted her fingers into his skull.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>Along with the cracking noise, San stopped crying. Lin Qiao dug the space-powered nucleus out of his head and put it in her palm before gripping it. The nucleus soon turned into a scorching hot stream of energy in her palm, quickly surging into her body through her arm.</p> <p>She then turned to look at the others and found that they had all quieted down. Viney lifted all the dead bodies and sent them to the woods area.</p> <p>Looking at those dehydrated corpses, Lin Qiao said to Viney, “Viney, just put all bodies together. You don’t need to bring them to the woods area particularly.”</p> <p>Viney piled these new bodies together with the four which were dropped in the woods by Lin Qiao earlier, then drew them back into the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to those corpses and picked up Er and San before flashing out of her space.</p> <p>Thud! Thud!</p> <p>She threw the two corpses to the ground, then clapped her hands and quickly moved away to dodge the Boss’ sharp metal blades.</p> <p>Boss glanced at Er who was lying on the ground motionlessly, and San, whose head was broken. Then, he turned to look at Lin Qiao, who had shown her face. Through the glasses, he stared at her with a vicious look.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the door and found countless metal objects piling on the gate and the fence wall, making the wall over three meters tall. The ordinary zombies outside weren’t able to come in, so they were trying to climb up while roaring now.</p> <p>After seeing Er and San’ bodies, Boss understood that the others had no chance of surviving either. He looked at Lin Qiao in the eyes, and the latter looked back at his eyes, as composed as always.</p> <p>None of them moved, while all kinds of noises and zombie roars could be heard from the outside.</p> <p>Right at that moment, the Boss’ eyes moved slightly. He suddenly glanced at where Lin Feng and his people stayed, then raised a hand and clenched his fingers toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>With that, countless metal objects immediately flew toward Lin Qiao. Within a blink, those metal objects turned into sharp thorns, darting at her from all directions.</p> <p>Seeing that, Lin Qiao flashed into her space. As she closed her eyes to see outside, she found that the Boss was gone.</p> <p>She walked to the pile of corpses and picked up two, then flashed back out. She went into the villa to find ropes, but there were none. So, she ripped off the curtains and tore them into strips, then brought them into her space.</p> <p>In the space, she tied the rest of the corpses together and dragged them all out.</p> <p>Except for the bald San and the ones that Viney had absorbed, the ones Lin Qiao had killed earlier on still had energy nuclei in their heads. So, after exiting her space, Lin Qiao dug out the remaining four energy nuclei.</p>",
  "Chapter 288: Had Enough After Sniffing": "<p>Lin Qiao understood why the Boss ran. Just now, Qiu Lili’s strong vibe had spread out from a long distance away. The Boss felt it clearly and left because of fear, while the zombie crowd outside the villa suddenly quieted down and stood transfixed to the ground.</p> <p>At that point, Grandpa flashed across the air and landed by Lin Qiao’s side, looking at the group of dead people on the ground with a mysterious look, his hands behind his back.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him, then said, “These people can be killed. If you want to eat, these five are still edible.” While speaking, she pointed at the few who were killed by her. However, Grandpa’s face showed dislike, as he shook his head.</p> <p>“No? Why?” Lin Qiao looked at him and asked curiously.</p> <p>“Roar…” Grandpa gave a roar. ‘They’re ugly.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao was speechless again, unable to think of a word to say.</p> <p>Would a zombie actually think that some human beings were too ugly?</p> <p>She then silently walked to the three captives and squatted beside the two boys.</p> <p>She brought out a cup of water from her space, then turned the two boys around and forced their mouths open before pouring the water in. After giving each of the two boys three cups of water, she raised her head to look at that girl.</p> <p>At that moment, the girl was sneakily looking at her. As Lin Qiao raised her head, they accidentally made eye-contact. The girl then clearly saw her purely black eyes.</p> <p>“Ah!” She was frightened immediately, so she moved backward as quickly as possible while screaming.</p> <p>She woke up upon hearing the noises from the outside. She thought that someone was here to save her, so she waited with both surprise and delight. Before long, she saw someone come in, rip the curtains off, and then disappear.</p> <p>She saw a bald person that she had never met before. It was no one from her squad. Therefore, she didn’t dare to many any sound, but quietly watched Lin Qiao yank the curtains down and disappear.</p> <p>Earlier on, she didn’t see Lin Qiao’s eyes.</p> <p>And now, she saw Lin Qiao came back in to feed water to her dying friends. She didn’t know what that water was. And unexpectedly, Lin Qiao raised her head and showed her a pair of zombie eyes!</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her, then stood up and turned to leave. She saw that Grandpa was still standing beside those corpses and looking at them.</p> <p>“You’ve been staring at them for a while. Are you really not going to eat them?” she asked.</p> <p>“Roar.” Grandpa raised his head to look at her, responded with a roar. ‘No.’</p> <p>“Then, why are you looking at them?” asked Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Roar…” roared Grandpa. ‘I’m sniffing at them.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao was speechless again.</p> <p><em>‘Grandpa, do you think that you’re a ghost? Can you be full after just sniffing at them?’</em></p> <p>“Let’s go back,” she said. After that, she sprung out of the fence wall. Grandpa turned around to glance into the living room, then left with Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After an hour of quietness, a group of people found this place with some difficulties.</p> <p>They finally got through the zombie crowd outside and carefully arrived at this area. They thought that they would be facing a bunch of extremely violent and wicked robbers, yet after approaching, they heard no sounds from them at all.</p> <p>After repeatedly confirmed the safety of this area, they climbed over the fence wall and saw those corpses that Lin Qiao had left in the front yard. Under that kind of situation, seeing dead bodies wasn’t scary, but running into living people was!</p> <p>As they got closer, they recognized those bodies as the group of robbers. Except for their leader, all the other robbers were lying there.</p> <p>“What… happened? They’re all dead!”</p> <p>“The leader’s body isn’t here!”</p> <p>“These few men look a little weird. Why do they seem to have been drained?”</p> <p>“Look at these few… Their heads are crushed or cut open.”</p> <p>They checked the bodies and found no biting marks and tearing wounds left by zombies.</p> <p>“Did someone kill them?”</p> <p>“That’s possible… There are wounds on their heads, but their hearts aren’t missing, and their brains are untouched. I don’t think it’s a high-level zombie who killed them.”</p> <p>“But, these two are both at level-six. What kind of powerful being can kill them all at one time?”</p> <p>“Get in here!” At that moment, the one who went in to check the living room suddenly ran out and yelled at the people outside. The group of people immediately walked into the villa and saw the three captives in a corner.</p> <p>The girl was still curling in the corner, her arms around her knees. As the group of people came in, she raised her head to look at them. The two boys beside her still remained in the same lying posture as when Lin Qiao had left.</p> <p>The group of people immediately came up and held up the girl and the two boys up from the ground, checking their bodies with concern. After that, they even wanted to kill those dead robbers again.</p> <p>They didn’t dare to ask the girl about what happened. Seeing her dull eyes, they were worried that their questions might stimulate her. They had found them, and they were still alive. That was enough.</p> <p>Anyway, the girl didn’t say anything.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Grandpa went back to the small hotel, and Qiu Lili showed up by her side.</p> <p>“How’s it going? Did they run?” Qiu Lili asked with a silvery voice.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her and said, “One ran away, and I killed the rest of them.</p> <p>Qiu Lili pouted and continued unhappily, “Robbers are the worst. They’re even worse than zombies! They eat people! And, they’re sneaky!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao patted her on the shoulder and said, “You should just stay away from them.” While speaking, she walked toward Lin Feng’s room. Seeing that she seemed to be in haste, Qiu Lili asked, “What’s wrong?”</p> <p>“We might need to leave this place. I’m going to explain the situation to Lin Feng,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Qiu Lili nodded and responded, “Alright!”</p> <p>Then, she followed behind Lin Qiao with no interest.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to Lin Feng’s door and asked Wei Jingchen, who was guarding outside, “Is Lin Feng in there?”</p> <p>Wei Jingchen nodded, then knocked the door before opening it and shouting, “Great Captain, Miss. Lu is here.”</p> <p>“Let her in,” Lin Feng’s voice was heard from the inside.</p> <p>Wei Jingchen pushed the door open, then stood aside and gave Lin Qiao a gesture to let her in.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili walked in, seeing that Lin Feng, Mrs. Lin, Li Zheng, Lei Yao, and a few others were sitting around the tea table, with a map spread on it.</p> <p>“Here, here, we’re trying to find a way from here to Upper City District. There’re many gas stations on the way. We need to find some gas.” As Lin Qiao came in, Lin Feng said to her without raising his head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to them and glanced at the map, then said, “We don’t need to look at the map for now. I think we should change our plan and go to Sea City Base to find Yuan Tianxing first.”</p> <p>Hearing her, the others were puzzled slightly, then raised their heads to look at her with confusion.</p> <p>“What? Did something happen?” Lin Feng asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao reached out her hand which was held behind her back; her fingers and palm were covered in blood.</p> <p>“Something did happen… I just killed a group of people.”</p>",
  "Chapter 289: Change the Plan": "<p>Hearing Lin Qiao say that she had just killed a group of people, all the others wore a serious expression, looking at her confusedly.</p> <p>“Please sit down,” Lin Hao stood up from beside her and offered her the chair, then sat on the windowsill. Lin Qiao sat down and looked at the others while speaking, “Just now, two groups of people showed up in the East, about three miles away. The first group was comprised of twelve robbers, and I’ve killed eleven of them. Their leader escaped, however.”</p> <p>“Robbers?” This word gave the others a start.</p> <p>“Are you talking about those man-eating post-apocalyptic robbers?” Lin Feng looked at Lin Qiao seriously. He didn’t miss the part that their leader had escaped. Post-apocalyptic robbers were all vengeful. As long as even one of them survived, that person would definitely come back to this place and fight a way to take revenge for his friends.</p> <p>Moreover, they were all extremely cruel and heartless. Otherwise, how could they get used to eating people?</p> <p>Therefore, anyone who happened to offend a robber or a group of them should better stay inside a base for one or two years. Otherwise, once out, he or she would be facing the robbers’ vengeance.</p> <p>With a frown, Lin Feng asked, “Which levels are their powers at? How ’bout that leader?”</p> <p>“The weakest ones among them were at level-four. The leader, the strongest one, was at level-seven,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Level-seven!”</p> <p>“Can you even force away a level-seven? Which exact level are you at now?”</p> <p>The others were all shocked upon hearing that the robber leader was at level-seven. That was the level of base leaders! More importantly, that level-seven robber leader had escaped because of Lin Qiao!</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and gave and grin, exposing her white, shiny teeth while replying, “How can I be so powerful? I can only handle level-six and below. But, you may not know yet, Lili has already broken into level-seven.”</p> <p>The people were shocked by her words.</p> <p>“Wait… wait a moment!” Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Qiao confusedly while saying, “Miss. Lu, are you saying that Lili is… a level-seven zombie now?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao smilingly looked at her and said, “Aunty, as I said, you can call me Tianyu, or Yu. You always call me Miss. Lu, which makes me feel distanced from you.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin paused slightly, then smiled and responded, “Ah, Tianyu… Eh, I’m used to calling you Miss. Lu earlier, so I always forget to change that.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled in response.</p> <p>Li Zheng, who was sitting next to her, asked in shock, “So Lili is a… zombie dominator now?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to nod at him and said, “Yeah, she’s a zombie dominator now.”</p> <p>“This is bad… The level-seven robber leader ran away,” Lin Feng said, “He’ll bring us troubles in the future!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao waved a hand at him and responded, “Not necessarily. At least, he doesn’t know that I’m with you. Even if there will be trouble, that’ll be for us only.”</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at her and wanted to say something, but didn’t. However, he was showing a worried look.</p> <p>“Don’t we have Lili now?” said Mrs. Lin, “We shouldn’t be afraid of them.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Lin Feng. She understood what he was worried about, “Aunty, hidden arrows are difficult to guard against. We’re stronger than he is, but we do need to prevent against any possible sneaky moves of his. There’s only one Lili. We’re safe around her, but we can’t guarantee that everyone will always stay with her.”</p> <p>Being reminded by Lin Qiao, Mrs. nodded with agreement, “You’re right.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao continued, “And, there is some other news. That group of robbers had made some kind of deal with a leader of Sea City Base. They were going to Sea City Base to hurt Wu Chengyue. Apart from him, they also planned to attack Yuan Tianxing. So, even if I didn’t kill them, they would come for us.”</p> <p>As she said that, the others all looked at her with surprise.</p> <p>“How can Tianxing have anything to do with it? The leaders of Sea City Base are Wu Chengyue, Yang Chao, and Zou Shihui. Everyone knows that Yang Chao has issues with Wu Chengyue, but what does that have to do with Tianxing? Is it because Tianxing is seeking cooperation with Wu Chengyue?” asked Lin Feng.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him, then nodded and said, “Em, that’s one of the reasons.”</p> <p><em>‘He also dated the prettiest lady in Sea City Base, so someone is jealous of him! We sent him to carry out a serious mission, yet he actually picked up a pretty lady.’ </em>Lin Qiao said in her head.</p> <p>“Those robbers were…” Lin Feng looked at her and continued.</p> <p>“They were rather strong,” said Lin Qiao, “I guess, Yang Chao wants them to kill Wu Chengyue for him in secret, so he wouldn’t need to do the dirty job himself. As for what he promised those robbers, I don’t know if he’s planning to keep his word or not. But, if I were him, I wouldn’t let those robbers join my base.”</p> <p>If Yang Chao was smart enough, he wouldn’t let a man who might become his new enemy join his base, right after taking out his old enemy… Not to mention the fact that the robber leader was at an equivalent level as him.</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded as he agreed with Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“So, you said that we need to change our plan. Are we going to find Deputy Chief first?” asked Li Zheng.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and replied, “Yes, we’ll head straight to Sea City Base, then help Yuan Tianxing with the recruitment. When we have hired enough people, we need to build our base as soon as possible. Once we have built our own castle, we’ll be able to defend against level-eight enemies, let alone level-seven.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and said, “I agree.”</p> <p>The others surely had no objection either.</p> <p>“When do we leave then?” Mrs. Lin glanced at Lin Feng, then at Lin Qiao, and asked. Lin Feng was looking at Lin Qiao as well.</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao stood up and said, “Now! Everyone, pack your things! We’re leaving this place.”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded in agreement and said, “Alright, let’s pack up and get ready to leave!”</p> <p>Having finished with the discussion, Lin Qiao turned and walked out toward Liu Jun’s room.</p> <p>“We’re going to leave… Pack your bags!” She said to Liu Jun and Xie Dong after entering the room. The two looked at her with surprise and asked, “Why are we suddenly leaving? Did something happen? Is it about Lili’s vibe that we sensed just now?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “We’ve changed out plan. We won’t stay here and wait for Yuan Tianxing. Instead, we’ll go to Sea City Base to find him. After that, we’ll head to Upper City District together, to build our base.”</p> <p>“Eh? Why?” Liu Jun carried Tong Tong as she asked.</p> <p>“He might get into trouble on his way back, so it’s better for us to go and find him,” Lin Qiao stood by the door and responded while taking over Tong Tong from Junjun’s hands.</p> <p>“Trouble? What kind of trouble?” After putting Tong Tong into Lin Qiao’s arms, Liu Jun looked at her confusedly and asked. Lin Qiao propped Tong Tong’s butt with one arm, then said to Liu Jun, “Some people have their eyes on him. I guess they’ll make a move after he has left Sea City.”</p>",
  "Chapter 290: Leaving For Sea City": "<p>Lin Qiao slightly tilted her head to look at Tong Tong, who was rubbing her head, and asked, “Is it fun?”</p> <p>Tong Tong was already used to Lin Qiao’s unpleasant dry voice. Hearing her question, he stopped, but his hands didn’t leave Lin Qiao’s bald head.”</p> <p>“Yes.” While speaking, Tong Tong glanced at Qiu Lili, who stood beside Lin Qiao. In fact, he wanted very much to touch Qiu Lili’s long and black twin-tails as well, but the latter wouldn’t let him.</p> <p>Liu Jun packed Tong Tong’s belongings and put the bag beside Lin Qiao, then raised her arms to take him over.</p> <p>“Let’s go,” Lin Qiao bent over to put the bag into her space, then sent Liu Jun and Tong Tong in as well. After that, she turned around and walked out of the room with Xie Dong.</p> <p>The members of the zombie squad didn’t have much carry-on luggage. Tong Tong had relatively more of it, and most of it was stored in Lin Qiao’s space.</p> <p>After coming out of the room, Lin Qiao told the others to go downstairs without her. She let out one of Yang Jianhua’s vehicles for Lin Feng and the others to drive, then climbed up to the roof and gathered the five zombie leaders.</p> <p>“Hold this rope together.” She found a hemp rope and made the five zombies hold it. Then, she brought them into her space together.</p> <p>At present, there was one extra small space next to the old small space, just as she had expected. This second small space was three times larger than the first one.</p> <p>The first space-powered man that Lin Qiao killed was only at level-three, so his space was merely as large as a small room. Unlike him, the bald robber’s space was rather large, about two-hundred-meters squared.</p> <p>After entering the space, Lin Qiao ordered zombie number one and zombie number two each too fetch a bucket of water and soak themselves. Now, she and the five zombie leaders were standing before the second small space.</p> <p>She pointed inside and said, “Get in, and stay inside. Don’t come out, and never get close to the lake. I’ve warned you. If you go to the lake and encounter a danger, don’t ask me for help.”</p> <p>While speaking, she glanced at the lake.</p> <p>However, her warning turned out to be unnecessary. The five zombie leaders had already started moving toward the second small space. Right now, they were all gazing at the lake nervously. Grandpa even inched his way backward to hide behind the other zombies.</p> <p>The moment they came in, they had sensed the strong vibe from the lake, which was even scarier than Qiu Lili’s.</p> <p>Qiu Lili kept her vibe restrained, but Viney never tried to do the same.</p> <p>Feeling the strange vibes of the five zombie leaders, Viney reached a few vines out of the lake, dancing in the air. Seeing the vines, the five zombie leaders immediately darted into the second small space, hiding behind the door before sticking their heads out to look at the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the five zombies who acted like frightened puppies, wanting to laugh. “Alright, Viney…” she turned to say to Viney, “Just meet the new guys. Don’t scare them.”</p> <p>Hearing her, Viney shrank back into the water, also restraining her vibe slightly. Only after that did the five zombie leaders calm down slightly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then glanced at Liu Jun and saw that the latter had put Tong Tong on the bed and started to tidy the small space. After cleaning, she would probably go clean the strawberry field and the vegetable field.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned and left the space, then leaped toward the direction that Lin Feng and the others were moving in; stepping on utility poles, buildings, trees, and other tall objects. Before long, she had caught up with the vehicle.</p> <p>As she landed on the car roof, two figures were already there. Qiu Lili was at the front while facing the wind, her long twin-tails fluttering in the air. Long Qingying was sitting behind with her legs crossed, her ponytail also dancing in the air.</p> <p>Lin Qiao landed between them. She looked around, then sat down and crossed her legs like Long Qingying.</p> <p>These three females stayed on the roof of an armed vehicle.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put her hat and sunglasses back on. Even though both Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili had restrained their vibes, the strong pressure that they had been giving out still kept the surrounding ordinary zombies away from the vehicle.</p> <p>The car avoided the abandoned vehicles and all other sorts of obstacles on the road, but was forced to stop after merely five miles.</p> <p>About twenty people barred the road. Looking at them, Lin Qiao wasn’t surprised at all.</p> <p>This group of was following behind those robbers. At the moment, the three captives were among them.</p> <p>Li Zheng was driving the car while Lei Yao was sitting in the front seat. After stopping the car, Lin Feng and Li Zheng got off, standing by the car.</p> <p>They looked at the group of people, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>The strongest two among this group of people were at level-six. However, neither of them looked good. They were all sallow, seeming to be in a difficult situation.</p> <p>Except for the pretty girl whom Lin Qiao had met before, the three other girls among these people were average-looking. However, they were all young, and had good body shapes.</p> <p>The two level-six humans walked out of the crowd to stand about six-meters away from Lin Feng.</p> <p>“We mean you no harm, so please don’t worry. We just want to make a trade with you, and we want to know if you’re willing to do that,” said one of them. These two should be the leaders of this group of people.</p> <p>“My name is Chen Yuting, and I’m the leader of the Fengting Hunting squad.” One of the two men who looked around thirty years old introduced himself. Then, he pointed at the man beside him and continued, “This is the other leader of our squad, and his name is Lu Changfeng.”</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at them expressionlessly and asked, “What do you want to trade?”</p> <p>“Weapons and food,” said Chen Yuting,”We have many level-four zombie nuclei, some level-five zombie nuclei, and water.”</p> <p>They didn’t plan to come to Hangzhou to hunt zombies. But unexpectedly, they encountered those robbers, who kidnapped their most important teammates. So, they followed them all the way to this area.</p> <p>Ninety percent of their weapons had been consumed on their way, and their food had been eaten up.</p> <p>“We don’t need water and zombie nuclei, and we don’t have many weapons,” Lin Feng refused them calmly.</p> <p>Hearing him, Chen Yuting and Lu Changfeng paused slightly, then glanced at each other in surprise. After that, they turned back to look at Lin Feng. They thought that Lin Feng would be willing to make the trade with them because they had said that they had water.</p> <p>Water, food and weapons were the most needed supplies. Among them, water was the scarcest resource, because without it, people would die quickly.</p> <p>“You… Don’t you want water?” A young man behind Lu Changfeng and Chen Yuting said abruptly, sounding a little anxious.</p>",
  "Chapter 291: I Can Do Anything You Want": "<p>Lin Feng looked at them blandly and said, “We do not lack water or zombie nuclei. So, please move away.”</p> <p>“But…” The look on the young man’s face changed. He wanted to say something else, but before he did that, Chen Yuting reached out a hand to stop him. He stopped the young man from continuing, then looked at Lin Feng and said, “Alright, sorry to bother you.”</p> <p>After saying that, he stood aside and slightly lowered his head as he said, “Make way for them.”</p> <p>However, only Lu Changfeng moved. The others weren’t willing to do the same.</p> <p>Lu Changfeng looked at them and said, “Move!”</p> <p>“Captain Lu!” The group of people looked at their leaders, wishing to speak but stopping on second thought. Chen Yuting coldly looked at his teammates and said, “I order you to move away. What are you doing? Do you want their car to run over you?”</p> <p>Hearing that, those people slowly moved to the roadside.</p> <p>Being driven by the situation, hunting squads often needed to cooperate temporarily, or make trades outside the bases.</p> <p>After finding the three people who were captured by those robbers, Chen Yuting and his people found that their weapons and food weren’t enough. As they were trying to figure out a solution, they heard the noise of a car. The noise told them that another hunting squad was passing by this area. So, they risked rushing onto the road to stop the car, even though they might need to face a zombie crowd.</p> <p>Before they heard the noise of the car, there were many zombies in this area. But to their surprise, those zombies slowly moved away for some reason as the car got closer and closer.</p> <p>Lin Feng turned to glance at Lin Qiao who was on the car roof. Qiu Lili had disappeared before these people showed up, as she had sensed the scents of human beings long ago. So, at the moment, only Lin Qiao, who was wearing a hat and a pair of sunglasses, and Long Qingying, who had her back to the engine cover, were sitting on the car roof.</p> <p>Lin Qiao only gave Lin Feng a glance, without saying anything. Her attitude made Lin Feng feel that she wouldn’t trade anything with these people. So, he turned and sat inside the car.</p> <p>Seeing that, Li Zheng followed Lin Feng into the car.</p> <p>Chen Yuting and his people looked at them, reluctantly waiting for them to drive away.</p> <p>As the car was about to drive past those people, a girl suddenly rushed out of the crowd, then ran up to the car and stopped it once again.</p> <p>“Lu Ting!” Watching the girl’s movement, Chen Yuting, Lu Changfeng, and their other teammates all shouted out loud, their expressions changing.</p> <p>Lu Ting was the girl who was kidnapped by those robbers. As she rushed over, Li Zheng slammed the brakes and stopped the car. Fortunately, the car wasn’t moving fast. Then, Li Zheng and Lin Feng got off the car for the second time, albeit impatiently this time.</p> <p>“What are you doing? Are you trying to kill yourself?”</p> <p>Lu Ting shook her head, then walked up to Lin Feng and raised her coquettish face, looking at him temptingly.</p> <p>“What can make you trade food and weapons with us? As long as you give me food, I can do anything you want… even… that thing…” Lu Ting’s expression didn’t change much when she finished her speech, but the look in her eyes was slightly awkward.</p> <p>However, she still said that, for food.</p> <p>Any man would understand her meaning. She was offering to trade food with her own body.This kind of a trade happened commonly in the post-apocalyptic world. It would happen both in or out of the bases.</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at her, then shook his head and said, “Sorry, my wife and child are in the car.”</p> <p>Clearly, he refused her, and also tried to tell the others not to misguide the child.</p> <p>A look of embarrassment flashed across Lu Ting’s face. She never thought that her plan would actually fail. It had always worked. But soon, she managed her expression and wore a smile before saying, “I’m sorry! But, are you sure that you don’t want to make the trade with us? I can serve someone else.”</p> <p>While speaking, she glanced at Li Zheng, then looked into the car. At last, she raised her head to look at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had been sitting on the car roof with her upper body leaning forward, elbows resting on the knees, and fingers crossed under her chin. At this point, she was looking at the girl with interest.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao was leaning forward and her coat was baggy, Lu Ting couldn’t see her chest. Added with the fact that she was wearing a pair of sunglasses and a hat, and no hair could be seen around the edge of the hat, Lu Ting thought that she was a man.</p> <p>She did look like a man.</p> <p>Lu Ting was trying to seduce her while glancing at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Lu Ting, wanting to laugh. The desperate look of hers that Lin Qiao had seen in those robbers’ place was gone, and instead, she was bravely using her beauty in the middle of the road.</p> <p>Lin Feng and Li Zheng glanced at Lu Ting for the last time, then turned back to look at Lin Qiao with a meaningful expression in their eyes. Lin Qiao glanced at Lu Ting, then at Chen Yuting and the others.</p> <p>She found that those people all seemed to be struggling. They didn’t seem to agree with Lu Ting’s behavior, especially Lu Changfeng. But at the same time, they seemed to want Lu Ting to succeed.</p> <p>They didn’t have any vehicles. Sea City Base was about three-hundred-miles away from this area, so to head back on foot, they would spend at least seven days if they sped up. During this time, they would encounter zombies and all sorts of dangers. They had water, but without food or weapons, they wouldn’t be able to make it back to Sea City.</p> <p>Therefore, to go back to the base alive, they had no choice but to wish that Lin Feng and his people were willing to trade food or weapons with them.</p> <p>Lin Feng’s car was excellently armed, so they guessed that the people in this car must have plenty of food and weapons.</p> <p>As no one responded to her, Lu Ting started to get anxious. She looked at Lin Feng eagerly, her eyes turning red as she begged helplessly, “I’m begging you… Please, please help us! We can do whatever you want, as long as you give us food and weapons.”</p> <p>As Lu Ting was prepared to play the ‘women’s trick’, Lin Feng and Li Zheng helplessly raised their heads to glance at Lin Qiao They wouldn’t know what to do when women were being unreasonable.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao stood up abruptly. Then, Chen Yuting, Lu Changfeng, and the others finally realized that she was a woman.</p> <p>Her breasts were huge!</p> <p>She numbly leaped off the car and walked to the shocked Lu Ting. While gently raising the girl’s chin, she asked a question blandly with her hoarse voice.</p> <p>“Will you do anything I want?”</p> <p>Lu Ting immediately came back to her senses. The look on her face turned a little strange, but still, she nodded calmly while looking at Lin Qiao determinedly.</p> <p>“Yes! As long as you don’t kill me, I’ll do anything you want.” Despite her words, her chin which was touched by Lin Qiao was already covered in goosebumps.</p> <p>She didn’t mind doing that thing with men… but with women…?</p> <p>She wasn’t a lesbian. So, she couldn’t accept getting physical with women!</p>",
  "Chapter 292: I Have No Interest": "<p>Lin Qiao gave a faint smile while looking at Lu Ting without saying anything. After four or five seconds, when Lu Ting was about to collapse under her gaze, she took her hand away and said, “Sadly, I have no interest in women, and I’m not a lesbian.”</p> <p>Lu Ting sighed with relief, then asked, “Then what do you want us to do?”</p> <p>She could tell that Lin Qiao didn’t refuse her as resolutely as the two men did. Also, she noticed that the two men took a glance at Lin Qiao earlier on when making the decision.</p> <p>She was willing to do whatever Lin Qiao asked, as long as the latter gave food and weapon to her and her friends.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Lu Ting, feeling that she was pretty perceptive. She turned to look at Chen Yuting and the others, then walked toward them.</p> <p>“If you really want to trade with us, I do have a job to offer you. I’m just not sure if you’re willing to take it.” She said that to Chen Yuting and the others, meaning that she needed men, and not women.</p> <p>Chen Yuting and his people understood her meaning. “What job? We’re willing to do it, as long as we can,” Chen Yuting quickly responded in surprise.</p> <p>“Em… construction workers,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Construction workers?” They were puzzled shortly upon hearing Lin Qiao’s answer, almost thinking that they had misheard her. However, Lu Changfeng soon figured something out. “May I ask what are you going to build?” he asked, “How long will it take? How much can we earn?”</p> <p>Hearing him, the others all nodded and agreed, “Yeah, you said construction workers… What do you want to build? Houses?”</p> <p>“A fence wall,” said Lin Qiao, “Barring accidents, it’ll take six to twelve months. Of course, I won’t force you to work. You will be paid with rice and flour daily. About the location, I can’t tell you that now, but I assure you it will be somewhere safe. What do you think?”</p> <p>People reacted differently after hearing her words.</p> <p>Chen Yuting and his people hadn’t thought that this kind of a good thing would happen to them. It was a fortune that Lin Qiao had offered them such a great job. By helping build a fence wall, they would be paid with rice and flour.</p> <p>Both rice and flour were very precious food now. In any base, only powerful people could get a slight amount of it.</p> <p>Li Zheng and Lin Feng glanced at each other, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>They didn’t plan to hire these people, as they had no access to their background information. Besides, they needed to go to Sea City Base before returning to the Upper City District of Hang Zhou. If they hired strangers on their way, some unnecessary problems might occur.</p> <p>They didn’t think that Lin Qiao would offer them the job at this time.</p> <p>“Is that real? How can we believe you?” Lu Ting suddenly asked a question.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned around and shrugged while saying, “Believe me or not, I don’t care. I’m not begging you now. You should be clear about your attitude. If you don’t come with us, we’ll keep looking for others. By the way, we’re heading to Sea City Base now. If you’re willing to work with us, I can send you back to your base for free.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, Lin Qiao turned and walked to the car silently.</p> <p>“I’ll give you three minutes to think. After that, we won’t wait.” While speaking, she hopped onto the car roof and then turned around, crossing her legs and sitting down.</p> <p>Lu Changfeng and Chen Yuting glanced at each other, then turned to look at the others.</p> <p>“What do you think? They’re not trustable, but we don’t have any better choice now,” Lu Changfeng said to the others.</p> <p>“I… I’ll go! We have no food or weapons now. We’ll be dead in just a couple of days, no matter how hard we try. Besides, this place is too far away from Sea City. We’ll either starve to death on our way back, or end up being eaten by zombies.”</p> <p>“You’re right. I’ll go too. I’m willing to believe her!”</p> <p>“But… What if she lied to us?”</p> <p>“They don’t look like robbers, but we can’t guarantee that they’re not. And… that woman didn’t tell us about the work location. What if they bring us to a dangerous place, and we can’t get back?”</p> <p>“But, we have nothing that they want. Why would she lie to us?”</p> <p>“I don’t think she has a reason to lie to us. Probably, they’re really short-handed. She said that they’re going to build a fence wall. Are they planning to build a small base somewhere?”</p> <p>“Small base? These few people? I think we shouldn’t believe them!”</p> <p>“I… I don’t care. I can do anything as long as I won’t starve to death… I still need to take care of my mother! Wealth comes from danger, isn’t that right? How can we know if we’ll find treasures or not without taking any risk?”</p> <p>“That’s right! We all need food. We can earn food by ourselves, but the most important thing right now is that we need to go back to the base alive, isn’t it?”</p> <p>“Me too.”</p> <p>“Me too.”</p> <p>Most of the group of people thought that they had no choice but to risk believing Lin Qiao. Chen Yuting and Lu Changfeng glanced at each other, then made up their minds and nodded.</p> <p>They turned and took a few steps toward Lin Qiao, then looked at her and said, “We agree to work with you. As long as you help us to get back to Sea City Base safely, we’ll build your fence wall for free for a month.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao clapped her hands, then nodded and said, “It’s great that you agreed! Let’s head to Sea City first. I’ll tell you about the next step there.”</p> <p>While speaking, she waved a hand.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>A minibus-sized green-colored armored vehicle appeared and fell heavily to the ground, stirring up a cloud of dust.</p> <p>Seeing the vehicle which looked exactly the same as the one under Lin Qiao’s feet, Chen Yuting and the others fixed their eyes on it with shock. Later on, they turned to look at Lin Qiao with disbelief.</p> <p>“You can drive this car for now. Don’t forget to give it back to me after getting back to Sea City Base,” Lin Qiao said to them blandly.</p> <p>“Re-really?” Chen Yuting looked at Lin Qiao in shock, who only gave him a faint smile.</p> <p>Li Zheng and Lin Feng turned to get into the car. Then, the car under Lin Qiao’s feet was started before being driven forward.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao’s car was driving away, Chen Yuting and the others immediately rushed toward the second car.</p> <p>“Hurry up, get into the car! We’ll talk later!”</p> <p>“This is real! Great!”</p> <p>They opened the car door and hopped in. Whether Lin Qiao was telling the truth or not, they would be able to return to their face safely with this car. In this case, the reliability of Lin Qiao’s words increased by fifty percent.</p> <p>The hunting squad was surprised to find out that the domineering woman who offered them the job was actually a space-powered one.</p> <p>In their eyes, space-powered people were the weakest.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao looked very strong.</p>",
  "Chapter 293: Bad Child Mengmeng": "<p>After a couple of hours of driving, the two cars stopped by a gas station.</p> <p>Lin Feng and Lin Qiao stood on the clearing nearby and spread a map. Lin Feng pointed at one spot on the map and said to her, “We should be able to arrive at this town before dark. We’ll stay there for the night, then leave tomorrow morning. Tomorrow noon, we should be arriving at Sea City.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Then, we’ll find a place in this area to stay over the night.”</p> <p>On the other side, Li Zheng and the others found some stones and built a stove with them. After that, they found some dry wood, also chopping all the wooden tables and chairs in the gas station into long pieces.</p> <p>Chen Yuting and his squad weren’t familiar with Li Zheng and his people yet, so they didn’t feel appropriate to interrupt them. Instead, they guarded aside awkwardly to prevent any possible sudden zombie attacks.</p> <p>“Which one of you have fire power? Come here and help us build a fire,” Li Zheng shouted at them.</p> <p>“Xu, go help them,” Chen Yuting instantly sent over one of his teammates.</p> <p>Except for the injured two who were still in a coma, there were twenty-one people in his squad. The vehicle that Lin Qiao lent them wasn’t large, but they could thankfully all squeeze into it. If not, a few of them would need to sit on the car roof.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a while watching Li Zheng and the others build a fire to prepare the food, then turned to walk toward the hill behind the gas station. This place was rather remote. Apart from the gas station and a convenience store, the staff dormitory of the gas station should be nearby.</p> <p>The area was surrounded by a series of hills, and on the hill behind the gas station was a small patch of woods.</p> <p>Lin Qiao headed toward the woods, and after stepping in, she looked around and soon found a white figure standing on top of a tree. Seeing Lin Qiao walk over, Qiu Lili pouted and said to her unhappily, “I want to stay inside the space. There’s so much dust out here!”</p> <p>No tall buildings existed on their way, so Qiu Lili had been leaping through treetops. However, she had still breathed in quite some dust.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to a rock and hopped onto it.</p> <p>“Come over here then,” she said.</p> <p>Qiu Lili airily landed on the tock, then reached out her hands toward Lin Qiao. The latter held her hands and brought her into the space.</p> <p>Seeing the two of them, Liu Jun asked with surprise, “Why are you in?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili ran to her own couch and sat on it, then lazily lied down.</p> <p>“Ah… it’s too dusty on the road. She doesn’t like it, so she asked me to bring her in,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Where are we now?” Liu Jun asked.</p> <p>“We just entered Fuyang City. Right now, we’re resting in a gas station. We’ll stay here for two hours and continue driving in the afternoon. In the evening, we should be arriving at a small town in Yuhang District. We’ll stay there for the night, and we’ll enter Jiaxing City tomorrow morning,” Lin Qiao said.</p> <p>“I see,” Liu Jun nodded and responded.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that moment, Mengmeng was catching birds on the other side of the woods. Suddenly, she felt that Qiu Lili’s vibe had disappeared. She paused briefly, then turned back to look at where Qiu Lili’s vibe disappeared, but only managed to grasp a trace of her scent.</p> <p>Then, she flashed toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was returning to the gas station. All of a sudden, she sensed a strong gust of wind blowing at her face. She calmly moved aside, then turned to look at Mengmeng with confusion, who was lying face down on the rock that she stood on before.</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>‘Where’s Lili? Where’s Lili?’</p> <p>Mengmeng lied on the rock and bared her teeth to roar at Lin Qiao. The latter looked at her and joked, “I ate Lili.”</p> <p>After spending a few days with Mengmeng, Lin Qiao felt that she was really like a naughty child. She was odd-tempered, willful at times, and she loved to play.</p> <p>She always stayed around Qiu Lili. She feared the latter, but also seemed to like her very much.</p> <p>If Tong Tong and Xiaolu were like her little toys, Qiu Lili could be described as her big toy. Also, Qiu Lili was like a friend that she had admitted.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t tell why Mengmeng suddenly lost her temper, but she still wanted to joke with her.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>‘You lie!’</p> <p>Mengmeng screamed, swiftly moving her limbs and pouncing on Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“You knew I lie, so why’re you nervous?” Lin Qiao leaped backward and flipped in the air before hopping onto a tree, then speaking lazily.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>‘I don’t care! Let Lili out!’</p> <p>Mengmeng ignored her words and just kept roaring at her while charging at her again.</p> <p>“I didn’t kidnap her,” said Lin Qiao helplessly, “She wanted to go in.” While speaking, she leaped off the tree.</p> <p>But before Lin Qiao landed, Mengmeng, who had leaped up, suddenly turned her body in the air and stepped on a tree nearby, lunging at the former.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was playing with her, and not seriously dodging her attack. As a result, she was grasped by Mengmeng from the back.</p> <p>Mengmeng jumped onto her back, her limbs wrapped tightly around her neck and waist, seeming to be desperate.</p> <p>“Roarrrr!”</p> <p>‘I don’t care! Let Lili out!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao steadied herself, then speechlessly turned to look at Mengmeng while saying, “What are you doing? Lili doesn’t like staying outside. It’s all dusty on the way. She didn’t want to stay outside. What can I do to her? Get down.”</p> <p>“Roar! Roar!”</p> <p>‘No! No!’</p> <p>Mengmeng hung herself on Lin Qiao’s back, then violently shook the latter’s head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hurriedly raised her head to stop Mengmeng, “Stop! Stop this! Get down!”</p> <p>However, Mengmeng shook her head more and more quickly. Lin Qiao tried to drag her down, but she refused, only holding Lin Qiao’s head with her claws.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found this both funny and annoying. She dragged Mengmegn’s arms and tried harder to get her down.</p> <p>“Scratching me won’t help. Lili doesn’t want to come out. What do I have to do with it?”</p> <p>Still, Mengmeng refused to let her go. As they pulled and dragged each other, Lin Qiao’s hat fell off, exposing her bald head.</p> <p>Clap! Clap! Clap!</p> <p>Mengmeng spread her fingers to slap Lin Qiao’s bald head and express her discontentment.</p> <p>As she refused to get down, Lin Qiao threatened her, “If you continue doing this, I’ll ask Lili to banish you! Will you listen to me or not!”</p> <p>Her threat immediately pissed Mengmeng off. She abruptly opened her mouth wide to bite Lin Qiao’s bald head.</p> <p>“Ah! Damn! You little devil! Your saliva is on my head!” Lin Qiao exploded, bursting in screams.</p> <p>She didn’t sense any pain from Mengmeng’s bite, but the sticky feeling on her head was pretty clear!</p> <p>She couldn’t stay calm anymore. Instead, she put forth her strength through her arm, dragged Mengmeng off, and threw her away.</p> <p>“Roar!” Mengmeng, who was violently dragged down by Lin Qiao, landed on the ground like a nimble cat. After that, she instantly bared her teeth toward the other.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was speechless.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! I really can’t pamper this naughty child!’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 294: Come At Night": "<p>Lin Qiao wiped her head with her hand and found that it was as wet as she had thought. With a dark face, she said to Mengmeng, “Biting me will change nothing. Lili won’t come out for now. Can’t you just follow me? You can go play with her when she’s out! Damn! Behave yourself, or I’ll tell Lili to beat you!”</p> <p>While speaking, she swung her hand and picked up her hat before putting it on and then turning to walk out of the woods.</p> <p>Mengmeng angrily glared at her, but didn’t dare to attack again. She was really worried that Lin Qiao would ask Lili to banish her.</p> <p>“Ah!” Mengmeng, who had no way to channel her anger, turned around and raised both arms to scratch the shank-thick tree, then violently slapped it with both hands.</p> <p>The tree was rustled by her, and many leaves fell off.</p> <p>Hearing the noise, Lin Qiao, who was walking out of the woods, gave a helpless smile, then continued walking toward the gas station.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Li Zheng and the others made some lean pork congee in a large, bucket-shaped iron pot. As Lin Qiao came back, Lin Hao handed her a large bowl of congee.</p> <p>“It’s Tong Tong’s lunch,” he said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took it over and nodded, then turned to look at the hunting squad. Each of their members was now holding a bowl of congee, squatting or sitting in a corner. They gulped impatiently, seemingly wanting to pour all of the hot congee into their mouths.</p> <p>Lin Qiao carried Tong Tong’s lunch and flashed into her space, then walked to Liu Jun.</p> <p>“Here’s Tong Tong’s food.”</p> <p>Liu Jun took over the bowl, then said to Tong Tong, who was playing with Viney by the lake, “Tong Tong, come here for lunch.”</p> <p>Tong Tong was squatting by the lake, playing with Viney’s two vines. Hearing Liu Jun’s voice, he didn’t stand up right away, but continued talking to Viney.</p> <p>“Viney, I’m going to have lunch. Do you want some?”</p> <p>Viney put a vine on his hand and said, ‘Viney has had lunch… Tong Tong, you go and eat…”</p> <p>Viney had eaten a few human beings this morning. She had absorbed the energies of those robbers, and had been waiting for Lin Qiao to come in so her body could be fixed further. However, Lin Qiao didn’t seem to have time for that now, so Viney stored the energy.</p> <p>“Alright,” Tong Tong nodded and stood up, then turned and said, “I’ll go have lunch then.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Liu Jun watched Tong Tong walk back from the lakeside. They weren’t worried that he might fall into the water, because Viney lived there, and she wouldn’t let anything happen to him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the lakeside and looked at Viney as she asked, “Viney, how much energy have you absorbed by now?”</p> <p>Viney coiled around Lin Qiao’s hand and responded, <em>‘Lots of it… One of those people had plenty of energy…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that she was talking about Er who happened to have green power. With curiosity, she said, “Eh? That man also had vines, like you.”</p> <p>Hearing her, Viney quickly wagged her vines and replied with disagreement,<em>‘Not the same, not the same… His vines were red…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with a smile, saying, “It’s just different color, calm down!”</p> <p><em>‘Mama, get down here,’ </em>said Viney <em>, ‘I can give you another treatment… Your hair might grow out…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao paused briefly, then looked at her and asked unsurely, “Can you do that? Do you have enough energy?”</p> <p><em>‘Yes, yes </em>!’ Viney said excitedly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment and then said, “Alright then, but I can’t do it now. I’ll come at night. Later on, I need to go out and travel with them. I’ll come back after we have found a place to stay for the night.”</p> <p><em>‘Alright! </em>‘ Viney responded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back and walked to Qiu Lili and the others, then found a teapot on a table. After that, she went back to the lakeside to fill it with water. Next, she turned and walked toward the two small spaces.</p> <p>While walking toward the second small space, she saw the few zombies sticking their heads out of the entrance. They sensed that Lin Qiao was getting close, so they found some courage to stick out their heads and look outside.</p> <p>Before that, they were curling inside the small space without daring to move.</p> <p>While blowing the hot congee for Tong Tong, Liu Jun asked Qiu Lili, “When did she get that extra small space?”</p> <p>“I don’t know,” Qiu Lili was lying on the couch, playing with her hair. Hearing Liu Jun’s question, she turned to glance at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao walked to the entrance of the second small space and saw the group of frightened zombies, so she asked them confusedly, “Are you really so afraid of her?”</p> <p>The group of zombies promptly responded with roars.</p> <p>‘Yes!’</p> <p>‘Very!’</p> <p>‘She’s terrifying!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood by the entrance, holding the teapot. “Take out your glasses. Don’t you want some water?”</p> <p>Hearing that, the five zombie leaders immediately took out their glasses.</p> <p>By now, they each had a bag, which was given by Lin Qiao for storing their glasses and other stuff.</p> <p>Lin Qiao filled their glasses, then left with the teapot. While walking past the first small space, she turned and looked inside. As she expected, the two level-four zombies were soaking in the water.</p> <p>These two zombies were allowed by Lin Qiao and Viney to fetch water from the lake. Every time, they would wait until the water in their bucket completely ran out of energy before slowly dragging their buckets to the lake to fetch fresh water.</p> <p>One time, because they moved too slowly, Viney directly reached up a few vines and dragged their buckets down to the lake before filling them up and then sending them back.</p> <p>Since then, they would always fetch water swiftly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao carried the teapot and passed by the first small space, walking to the couch to sit down and put the teapot on the table.</p> <p>“Your two underlings are almost ready for treatment. Tonight, send them out to find energy nuclei,” she said.</p> <p>Qiu Lili glanced at the two zombies, then nodded.</p> <p>“I haven’t asked you this yet,” Lin Qiao continued curiously, “Were those two related to you before death?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili shook her head and said, “Not at first. I met them a few years ago, not long after the apocalypse. Back then, they were still alive. At one time, I tried to get close to some humans, but they kicked me out. Those people were all so afraid of me. I did nothing, but they attacked me. Only those two didn’t reject me. They even tried to persuade the others to accept me.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the two zombies with surprise, then turned back to continue listening to Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Qiu Lili carried on, “After that, I sneakily followed behind them. Days later, the two of them were pushed out by the others to hold off some zombies. They were bitten by zombies, and I didn’t manage to save them. So, after they turned into zombies, I kept them.”</p> <p>Liu Jun and Lin Qiao both looked at Qiu Lili. No wonder she brought those two zombies everywhere.</p> <p>Qiu Lili turned around and lay on the couch on her stomach, looking at the first small space and continued, “I wish Viney can restore some of their memories.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced in that direction, then turned back to Qiu Lili. She understood that the latter had affection for those two zombies as they had been following her for years, even though they were just two memory-less zombies.</p>",
  "Chapter 295: Her Hair Do Grow Out": "<p>Lin Qiao sat there for a short while and then exited her space, because the people outside were almost ready to continue the journey.</p> <p>The people in the hunting squad which was named Fengting Squad were starving for days. But now, they each had a full bowl of hot congee and restored some energy. At the moment, they looked much more energetic than before.</p> <p>During the break, except for Lin Qiao and Long Qingying who stayed outside, the other female members on Lin Feng’s side didn’t come out of the car. Chen Yuting and his people saw Lin Hao send food into the car, so they figured that there were some people in the car who didn’t come out.</p> <p>“Get in the car. Check the vehicles, then get ready to go,” Lin Feng shouted at the others.</p> <p>After everyone got on the car, the two vehicles moved toward Sea City.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Long Qingying were still sitting on the car roof, right under the sunlight. Lin Qiao felt hot, but she didn’t get inside the car, as she needed to sit on the car roof to scare away the zombies on the road.</p> <p>It was October already; the daytime was hot, but the nighttime had become a little chilly. After the apocalypse, the nights in autumns could be very cold.</p> <p>It was truly dusty on the way.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At dusk, they entered Yuhang District. On the way, Chen Yuting and Lu Changfeng felt stranger and stranger, as they hadn’t seen even one zombie on the road! Why?</p> <p>They had noticed that this morning, but didn’t pay much attention to it, as they were driving on highways or suburban areas. But later on, they found that they were strangely safe even when passing by the center of Hangzhou, which was a crowded zombie city.</p> <p>Lin Feng zigzagged when driving through the city. The city used to be crowded with both people and buildings. Hence, many roads and streets were jammed by abandoned cars, rocks, or other large obstacles.</p> <p>To hurry on with the journey, Lin Feng didn’t especially look for a safe place to stay for the night. After all, with Lin Qiao, Qiu Lili and the other zombie friends, anywhere would be safe.</p> <p>At last, when it was getting dark, Lin Feng found a club which had hotel rooms, bars, a foot bath center, sauna rooms, billiard tables, and all other kinds of recreational facilities.</p> <p>As they stopped their cars, all the zombies in the club ran away.</p> <p>Lin Feng and his people pulled the cars before the club, then got off and raised their heads to look at the front door and the sign of the club.</p> <p>“We’ll stay here for tonight. This building is nearly sealed with high security.”</p> <p>Unlike Lin Feng and his people who were relaxed, Chen Yuting and his squad got off the vehicle alertly, but then found no zombie around them.</p> <p>Seeing this, both Chen Yuting and Lu Changfeng showed a weird expression.</p> <p>Why didn’t any zombie approach them? This place was supposed to be full of zombies. However, the zombies they saw on the way even escaped at the sight of them.</p> <p>They guessed that Lin Feng and his people must have something that all zombies were scared of.</p> <p>The group of people walked into the club. It was dark, and there was no electricity in the city. So, they checked around with flashlights.</p> <p>Not a single zombie was found in the club, even though this place was all dark.</p> <p>Lin Feng and his people found the diner and the bar, then started preparing some simple food. About thirty people gathered in the diner, waiting for dinner to be ready.</p> <p>As no one was paying attention to her, Lin Qiao walked away.</p> <p>She flashed into her space, then said to Qiu Lili, “Lili, you go out to keep an eye on those people. I need to go down into the lake tonight.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili sat up from the couch, then nodded and replied, “Alright!”</p> <p>After sending Qiu Lili out, Lin Qiao released the group of zombie leaders and the two level-four zombies. Following that, she walked to the lake and dragged a chair to the lakeside. Before walking into the lake, she took off her hat and sunglasses, and stripped herself.</p> <p>Tong Tong had fallen asleep in Liu Jun’s arms long ago, who sat on the couch, looking at Lin Qiao’s back as the latter was walking into the water.</p> <p><em>‘Her back is beautiful. Her waist is slim, hips are round, legs are long, and her skin is snow-white. She would look stunning if she had long hair hanging loosely on her back.’</em></p> <p><em>‘Sadly, she’s bald.’ </em>Liu Jun thought.</p> <p>Lin Qiao touched her stomach which still felt weirdly soft, like cotton. As she stepped into the water, Viney’s vines coiled around her feet and dragged her deeper down.</p> <p>Countless vines wrapped on her body, slowly turning her into a jade-white cocoon.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed a familiar energy seeping into her body, and then, her body which could only sense warmth and not coldness started feeling hot. She didn’t know if her hair could grow out this time, but she could tell for sure that at least her stomach would recover further.</p> <p>Her stomach felt hotter and hotter, as if a fire was burning in it. She also felt that her throat and brain were on fire.</p> <p>A faint green light shone from the jade-white cocoon. A long while later, the light faded slowly, then a dark mist abruptly spread from the cocoon.</p> <p>The mist didn’t merge into the water, but moved quickly.</p> <p>The moment the black mist emerged, the jade-white vines suddenly unwrapped Lin Qiao.</p> <p>The black mist covered her entire body. Without Viney’s support, her body didn’t sink to the lake bottom, but floated in the water.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao woke up, she saw nothing but darkness. She thought that she wasn’t clear-headed yet. However, two seconds later, she suddenly realized that the darkness before her eyes was her black mist.</p> <p>As she generated a thought, the dark mist gathered toward her palm, and the darkness before her eyes disappeared.</p> <p>Right then, she found that she was still in the lake.</p> <p>As all the dark mist had drilled into Lin Qiao’s palm, Viney, who had been waiting below, reached up her vines.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, Mama, you’re awake!’ </em>Viney wrapped Lin Qiao’s waist to send her up.</p> <p><em>‘Yeah </em>,’ Lin Qiao responded in her mind, <em>‘How long has it been? </em>‘</p> <p>Viney answered her question, <em>‘Not long, just a couple of hours </em>.’</p> <p>Sometimes, Lin Qiao was curious about where Viney came from. She was like a child, yet she knew lots of things. She was affectionate, but also had a wide range of knowledge.</p> <p>Lin Qiao came out of the water and swam toward the lakeside. After coming ashore, the first thing she did was to dress herself.</p> <p>“Eh? I think your hair grew out… but short…” A voice was heard from beside her. Following the voice, Liu Jun showed up like a ghost.</p> <p>Lin Qiao paused briefly, then turned to look at Liu Jun. After that, she raised a hand to touch her own head.</p> <p>Then, she understood what Liu Jun was talking about.</p> <p>Her hair did grow out… but…</p> <p>The hair she touched were very short…</p> <p>She guessed that even freshly shaved hair could be longer than hers.</p> <p>Then, she heard Liu Jun add, “Eh, why did Lili’s hair grow so long, but yours only grew by a tiny bit? Haha… I wonder if there’s a secret relationship between Lili and Viney!”</p>",
  "Chapter 296: Leave Me Alone": "<p>Lin Qiao silently looked at Liu Jun and threatened the latter with her eyes, <em>‘I’ll hit you if you don’t shut up.’</em></p> <p>Liu Jun smiled and turned to glance at the lake, then asked, “Aren’t you gonna ask Viney about your current condition?”</p> <p>Being reminded by her, Lin Qiao decided to ask about it.</p> <p>“Viney?” She put her clothes on and turned to shout at the lake. Then, she abruptly touched her stomach.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? It became harder!’</em></p> <p>Viney reached a vine out of the water to the lakeside, then coiled around Lin Qiao’s hand.</p> <p><em>‘Mama…’</em></p> <p>“Viney,” Lin Qiao asked her, “Why is it so hard for my hair to grow? Lili’s hair have grown so long, but mine only grew a tiny bit.”</p> <p>Viney responded with, <em>‘Mama, I focused the energy on your tummy, so the recovery of your hair and throat might be slower… But Mama, your hair are alive now, not as dead as before. Mama, you don’t need me to cure your hair anymore, because they’ll grow out by themselves, a little slowly though.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the vine with surprise, saying, “Eh? Can my hair grow by themselves now? Like a healthy human being?”</p> <p>Liu Jun, who stood beside Lin Qiao, looked at her in shock. Judging by Lin Qiao’s words, her hair were now able to grow like those of healthy human beings. They were no longer dead like the hair of zombies.</p> <p><em>‘Yes, yes, that’s true… Mama, I’m a little tired, </em>‘ said Viney.</p> <p>Seeing that Viney’s vine wasn’t twisting as energetically as before, Lin Qiao said, “Alright, go get some rest. Thank you, Viney!”</p> <p><em>‘Mama, you thanked me again… </em>‘ said Viney unhappily. <em>‘You’re making me feel like an outsider… </em>‘</p> <p>Sensing Viney’s discontentment, Lin Qiao hurriedly touched the vine on her wrist and said, “Sorry, my mistake! My dear Viney is so adorable, how can she be an outsider? We’re a family!”</p> <p>Hearing that, Viney was cheered up, <em>‘Yeah, yeah, Viney is the most adorable one… Mama, I’m going down to sleep. Call me if you need anything…’</em></p> <p>While speaking, she unwrapped Lin Qiao’s wrist and drew back into the lake.</p> <p>Liu Jun looked at Lin Qiao and asked curiously, “Is Viney unhappy? What’s exactly is the relationship between you two? You only thanked her, and that made her unhappy?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “I’m not sure what’s her relationship with me. But, when she showed up for the first time, she called me… eh… Mama.”</p> <p>Liu Jun popped her eyes and stared at Lin Qiao with disbelief, saying, “What? She called you Mama? She’s not your child, is she?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with a strange expression and asked, “Do you mean my child or Lu Tianyu’s? Have I been pregnant before? I don’t remember that.”</p> <p>Liu Jun lowered her eyes and thought for a moment, then said, “Before our base was destroyed, I had never heard that our Chief was pregnant. Even if you were pregnant, you wouldn’t let everyone know so soon, right? And, no one saw you with pregnant belly before.”</p> <p>While speaking, she glanced at Lin Qiao’s stomach.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “But, this isn’t my old body. Even if I were pregnant, the baby might have gone already. It can’t be that… the baby’s soul reincarnated along with mine… can it?”</p> <p>After saying that, she suddenly paused, then silently looked at Liu Jun.</p> <p>“It… might be… possible,” Liu Jun looked back at her.</p> <p>Both of them stayed silent for seven or eight seconds.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao covered her forehead with a hand and said with disbelief, “Wait a minute, leave me in peace! That can’t be possible!”</p> <p>Liu Jun widely opened her eyes and responded, “Why not? Didn’t you reincarnate? Why can’t the baby reincarnate as well?”</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao suddenly thought of another question. She put down her hand and said, “Wait, wait, you said that I was pregnant… Then, who was that man?”</p> <p>Liu Jun looked at her and remained silent for three seconds, then said, “I can only tell you that before he betrayed the entire base, he was with you the whole time…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao gazed at her and said with a serious look, “Are you talking about… Yang Jianhua?”</p> <p>Both of them fell into silence again.</p> <p>But suddenly, Lin Qiao’s face turned dark. “Are you saying that I was in a relationship with Yang Jianhua, and I was pregnant with his baby. However, before he found out about the baby, that scum betrayed me, and the baby, and the base? Am I right?” She said with an icy-cold voice.</p> <p>Liu Jun sensed that the air pressure around Lin Qiao getting lower and lower. With a frown, she said, “Calm down, calm down! That’s merely my guess. Before you restore your memories, all these can only be guesses. Perhaps, the baby isn’t brought here by you… And maybe, Yang Jianhua isn’t the father, but someone else is…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao took a deep breath to calm herself down. She pondered over Liu Jun’s words, and found that they were reasonable indeed. She suddenly recalled the purple-red color that she saw near the bottom of the lake, and started wondering if that was… the outside of her womb.</p> <p><em>‘No way! Viney isn’t my baby, is she?’</em></p> <p>“Just, just leave me alone!” Lin Qiao said with a dull face, then flashed out of the space. After coming out, she stood on the roof of the club and lowered her head while touching her stomach.</p> <p>For some reason, she became very sensitive about the whole pregnancy guess after hearing Liu Jun’s words. She even started looking forward to something in a strange way.</p> <p>Was she really in a relationship with Yang Jianhua? If that were true, she must have been blind before, as she actually fell with a man like that! So blind!</p> <p>Thinking about the Yang Jianhua that she had met recently, and that she had probably slept with him before, she felt sick.</p> <p>She pressed a hand on her lower belly, wondering how the baby had been existing in her space if its soul had truly reincarnated along with hers.</p> <p>Viney said that she would be able to come out after reaching level-five. But, in what way?</p> <p>Lin Qiao wouldn’t need to give birth to Viney, would she?</p> <p>Her stomach was empty now. Even though her womb might still remain, it must be dead after she turned into a zombie. Was she still able to create a life?</p> <p>Somehow, another possibility popped up in Lin Qiao’s mind as she suddenly recalled that the previous owner of her body had had sex with Wu Chengyue.</p> <p><em>‘Eh… No way…!’</em></p> <p>If it were Wu Chengyue’s spermatozoon, added with Lu Tianyu’s egg, then added with the soul of her baby…</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that if she were really going to give birth to a baby, she would have to do a DNA test after the baby was born.</p> <p>While she was thinking about this baby issue on the roof, the look on her face suddenly changed. Then, she walked to the edge of the roof and looked down.</p> <p>It was late at night. She saw a few people sneakily walking around the vehicle that she had lent to Feng Ting Squad.</p> <p>She frowned slightly, then put her hat on and turned herself visible before leaping off the roof.</p>",
  "Chapter 297: They Are Bolder than They Should Be": "<p>The people around the car were Lu Changfeng and Lu Ting, along with other two from their squad. At that moment, Lu Changfeng’s face was showing disagreement. “Lu Ting, it’ll be too unkind for you to do it,” he said with a low voice, “They helped us, but we’re stealing from them.”</p> <p>Lu Ting said scornfully, “Brother, do you think that they’re really helping us? I doubt it! They said that they’ll hire us as construction workers and pay us with rice and flour. That sounds so nice, but how can such a good thing be possible right now? They must have some unspeakable secrets. Perhaps, they want us to die. Besides, I’m only going to take the vehicle. I won’t do them any harm, will I? If I wanted to kill them, they would have become defenseless by now.”</p> <p>Lu Changfeng stayed silent for a short while, then continued, “But, what about Chen Yuting and the others? What should they do if we left? We’ll get them killed.”</p> <p>“What does that have to do with us?” said Lu Ting who seemed to be a little angry, “You’re both squad leaders, but why does everyone only listen to him? Why don’t they take you seriously? And those two useless dying men, I had said that we should leave them, but he insisted on bringing them back. How will that help? Will they ever recover?”</p> <p>The two useless dying men that she mentioned were the two boys who were also kidnapped by those robbers.</p> <p>Lu Changfeng said with a sullen look, “Lu Ting, there is hope as long as they’re still alive. And, we’re already halfway down to the base, aren’t we? Just hold on for a little longer, and we’ll be in the base tomorrow. Why do you have to do this?”</p> <p>Lu Ting turned to look at the vehicle beside her and reached out a hand to touch it while saying greedily, “Brother, you’ve been thinking too much, that’s why you had Chen Yuting stepping on you the whole time. Brother, look at this car! Isn’t it cool? Isn’t it great? And all the weapons on it… We ordinary people can’t possibly obtain these. Brother, don’t you want such an incredible car? With this, we’ll be much safer when carrying future missions, won’t we?”</p> <p>With those words, she slowly incited Lu Changfeng.</p> <p>As she expected, the look in Lu Changfeng’s eyes changed slightly when he looked at the car after hearing her words.</p> <p>No man didn’t like cars. This heavily armed military vehicle was way better than the ordinary modified cars, for both offense and defense.</p> <p>“Brother, make the decision now,” Lu Ting urged Lu Changfeng anxiously, “Aliu’s hypnotizing power is going to fail soon. When they wake up, we won’t have a chance anymore!”</p> <p>Lu Changfeng was tempted, but still had hesitation.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao sneakily approached Lu Ting, reached out a hand, and suddenly gripped her slim neck. Then, she pressed her on the car.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>“Ah!” Lu Ting wasn’t prepared for this. As Lin Qiao abruptly grabbed her neck and pressed her against the car, she burst in a scream. But then, she confusedly gazed at the air before her eyes.</p> <p>However, her neck was grabbed by a hand, and that feeling was so real.</p> <p>“Hem… em… hem… eh…” The suffocation made her brain feel hot, also giving her a dull pain in the chest. She hastily put her hands around her neck, and touched an arm. Then, she moved her hands forward along the arm, and only found a shoulder.</p> <p>Lu Changfeng and the others were shocked by Lu Ting’s sudden movements. Her face seemed to have twisted in pain, as if something was grabbing her neck. However, they couldn’t see what was attacking her. They were all stunned, even forgetting to react.</p> <p>Only until they saw a figure show up before Lu Ting did they realize what was happening.</p> <p>“Woman, I could tell that you’re very ambitious. But, your courage turns out to be even bigger than your ambition.” A hoarse voice was heard.</p> <p>Lu Ting stared at Lin Qiao who showed up right before her eyes with fright. She opened her mouth, but couldn’t say anything. Her face had paled because of suffocation.</p> <p>A series of metallic friction noise was heard as Lu Changfeng and the other two came back to their senses and pointed their guns at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Stop it! Let her go!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to look at him. Her eyes were invisible, hiding under her sunglasses and the darkness of night, yet her lips were curving downwards.</p> <p>“I was going to let her live, but you don’t seem to want her to stay alive, as you’re actually pointing your guns at me.” Her deep and dry voice sounded even grimmer than it originally was in the darkness.</p> <p>At the same moment, Lin Qiao slightly clenched her fingers which were squeezing Lu Ting’s neck.</p> <p>Lu Ting opened her mouth wide to breathe like a fish which had left the water. However, she couldn’t inhale any air. She felt that her chest was going to explode. She opened her eyes so wide that her eyeballs seemed to even pop out of her eye sockets.</p> <p>Lu Changfeng paused again; his hands holding the gun were shaking slightly.</p> <p>At that very moment, Lin Qiao moved. She took a step backward, then let go of Lu Ting.</p> <p>Lu Ting softly fell to the ground like a piece of rag. She covered her neck with both hands while gasping for air.</p> <p>“Eh-hem-hem…” Sitting slumped on the ground, she coughed in pain.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her and said, “I don’t like killing people for no reason, and I will never kill people just randomly. I’ll spare your lives, as you were only trying to steal from me. Piss off.”</p> <p>While speaking, she turned and walked toward the club.</p> <p>Lu Changfeng hurriedly dropped the gun and ran to Lu Ting.</p> <p>“Lu Ting! How are you? Are you alright?”</p> <p>Lu Ting had breathed in the air. The dull pain from her chest was not yet gone, but at least, she now felt better.</p> <p>She raised her head and gazed at Lin Qiao’s back. Her face was wearing a dark look, her eyes filled with strong hatred and murderous intent. As Lu Changfeng got close to her, she suddenly seized his gun and fired at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>A series of gunshots was heard.</p> <p>“Lu Ting! Stop!” Lu Changfeng was startled by her move. By the time he could react, Lu Ting had already fired the gun.</p> <p>Right when Lu Ting fired, Lin Qiao swung her arm backward and made a fist in the air, then spread her fingers. A few bullets were lying on her palm.</p> <p>Ting! Ting! Ting! She threw the bullets to the ground.</p> <p>Lu Ting and the others popped their eyes in shock. Lu Ting couldn’t see the bullets clearly, but she was able to recognize the sounds of bullets falling on the ground.</p> <p>“You did this to yourself. Since you want to die… I’ll fulfill your wish,” Lin Qiao said blandly.</p> <p>Then, she suddenly flicked her fingers toward Lu Ting.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>A slight sound of wind rose, then Lu Ting’s expression froze as she fell to the ground.</p> <p>Seeing that Lu Ting had stopped moving, Lu Changfeng squatted in a flurry and held her while shouting, “Lu Ting! Lu Ting? Lu Ting!”</p> <p>As he picked her up, he saw a stream of blood slowly gush out of her head. Then, half of her head fell off, exposing her pink brain matter.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was less than two meters away from Lu Ting, so as she flicked her sharp claws, Lu Ting’s skull was directly cut off.</p> <p>“I said that I don’t like killing people for no reason… But, that doesn’t mean that I’ll let people kill me,” Lin Qiao looked at Lu Changfeng and said in a bland tone.</p>",
  "Chapter 298: Killed Directly": "<p>At present, Lin Qiao wasn’t as afraid of level-six powerful people as she used to be. So, she didn’t worry that Lu Changfeng, who was a level-six water-powered man, might attack her.</p> <p>Earlier in her space, Viney had improved her power further. Judging by her green pupils behind her sunglasses, she was now at the level of zombie leaders. However, she wasn’t sure about her comprehensive strength yet. But at least, she was no weaker than zombie queens and kings.</p> <p>Therefore, she was now able to calmly face level-six people, unlike this morning. Back then, she still needed to drag her level-six enemies into her space to weaken them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned around again, walking toward the club.</p> <p>Right at that moment, a white figure came down from the sky and flashed across Lu Changfeng and the other two men. Then, the three men fell to the ground.</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Hearing the noises from behind, Lin Qiao glanced back and saw Qiu Lili standing there, looking at her.</p> <p>“Are you gonna let these people go? Letting them go will only bring us trouble in the future.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Qiu Lili, then smiled and said, “I was waiting for you to do something, wasn’t I? I may have a chance to win against him, but it will take some effort. But for you, it’s just a piece of cake.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili looked at her and thought of something. “So, you were waiting for me to do your dirty jobs!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the few men who were knocked out by Qiu Lili and responded, “Yeah.”</p> <p>Abruptly, she walked to them and squatted by Lu Ting’s body, then put her fingers into her cut-open head and dug out an energy nucleus.</p> <p>The level-four energy nucleus was glowing with a faint blue light in the darkness.</p> <p>Earlier on, she didn’t understand why Lu Changfeng and Chen Yuting wouldn’t give up on chasing those robbers. They were clearly aware of the fact that they were no match for those robbers, but why did they keep pursuing them in a suicidal way?</p> <p>Just now, on hearing Lu Ting call Lu Changfeng brother, Lin Qiao realized that they were brother and sister. However, she always felt that the other members of Feng Ting Squad had looked at Lu Ting in a different way.</p> <p>They seemed to consider her important, but what was important to them didn’t seem to be her as an individual. Instead, it should be something that she had. Lin Qiao had observed Lu Ting, and found nothing of hers that deserved extra attention. So, she figured that the important thing was Lu Ting’s power.</p> <p>Lu Ting hadn’t used her power in front of Lin Qiao and her people yet.</p> <p>All that could mean that Feng Ting Squad people cared a lot about her power. The powers that could draw the greatest attention were none other than water power and space power.</p> <p>Lin Qiao dug out her energy nucleus and guessed that she might have water power, because earlier on, Chen Yuting had offered to trade food with water. Besides, Lu Changfeng had water power as well, so Lin Qiao thought that maybe Lu Ting had the same power as his brother.</p> <p>However, as the nucleus turned into a stream of energy and flowed into her body, then into her brain, Lin Qiao knew that she was wrong.</p> <p>That wasn’t a water-powered nucleus, but a space powered one!</p> <p>Sensing the change of her space, Lin Qiao was speechless. Why were space-powered people so easy to find now? She had met two of them within a day.</p> <p>She glanced at Lu Changfeng and the other two who had passed out, then raised her head to ask Qiu Lili, “Why didn’t you kill them? Why did you knock them out?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili turned around and snorted, “I don’t kill people for no reason!”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao had no choice but to swing her claw at the three men.</p> <p>Puff, puff, puff. The slight sounds of wind and the noises of flesh and bones being cut were heard.</p> <p>Back in the old world, Lin Qiao definitely wouldn’t kill people randomly, because that was illegal. But now, murder was no longer a crime. The strongest ones could be the bosses and make all the rules!</p> <p>The post-apocalyptic world was chaotic. People were all trying to survive, and law meant nothing.</p> <p>Of course, they were rules in the bases. Otherwise, there would be no way to manage all those people. In the old world, there were national laws and family rules, and currently, there were strict rules in every base.</p> <p>However, outside the bases, rules didn’t exist.</p> <p>So, no one would care about the people who died outside. People were allowed to take revenge, but not in the bases. On the outside, they were allowed to kill anyone they wanted.</p> <p>Anyway, if they died, their food could be saved.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wouldn’t kill these people if they didn’t grow murderous intention toward her. However, they did want to kill her. For that reason, Lin Qiao wouldn’t let them live as future troubles.</p> <p>The ungrateful people would never thank the ones who helped them, but would only keep in mind how the others mistreated them, and try to make reprisal.</p> <p>Qiu Lili dug out the three men’s energy nuclei and wiped them clean on the corpses, then put them into her purse. Lin Qiao then turned and walked into the club.</p> <p>Walking into the diner, she saw a group of people lying motionlessly on the ground and tables.</p> <p>Lin Feng was leaning against the bar like a drunk man who had just woken up. He supported his head with his hand, not seeming able to open his eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him, then found Mrs. Lin and the other ladies with her eyes. The ladies were all lying on the couches asleep; Lin Xiaolu was lying face down on Cheng Wangxue’s laps.</p> <p>As she turned back to look at Lin Feng, she picked up a glass on the table. The glass disappeared in her hand for two seconds, then reappeared, filled with water. After that, she squatted before Lin Xiaolu and held her up to slowly pour the water into her mouth. Then, she gave Mrs. Lin, Lin Wenwen, and Cheng Wangxue each a glass of water.</p> <p>Next, she walked to the bar and gave a glass of water to Lin Feng.</p> <p>She felt a strange energy from those people that didn’t originate from themselves. It should be the power of someone named Aliu that Lu Ting mentioned earlier; that should be what had put these people into unconsciousness.</p> <p>She couldn’t find how that energy made all these people fall asleep.</p> <p>After Lin Qiao made them drink the lake water, that strange energy faded slowly.</p> <p>“What… what happened?” Mrs. Lin asked with both surprise and confusion on seeing that people were all lying on the ground, tables, or chairs.</p> <p>“You were immobilized by someone while I was not here. If I came out later, we’d have lost a vehicle tonight.”</p> <p>But of course, she would certainly be able to get that lost vehicle back.</p> <p>“What happened?” Lin Feng looked at her confusedly as well.</p> <p>“Lu Ting tried to steal the car that I lent them today while you were sleeping,” said Lin Qiao, “But, I’ve already killed them.”</p> <p>“What? You killed them?” Lin Feng, Mrs. Lin, and the others looked at her with surprise.</p> <p>They weren’t blaming her, but were just shocked by the fact that Lin Qiao killed those people directly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spread her hands and said, “I didn’t start it. For the ones who shoot at me, I’ll never be soft-hearted.”</p> <p>“Alright!” Lin Feng nodded and responded.</p>",
  "Chapter 299: Earned A Few Tanks of Gas": "<p>Lin Qiao woke up the others with the lake water, then told Chen Yuting and his people about what Lu Changfeng and Lu Ting did. Upon hearing that, Chen Yuting was angry as well.</p> <p>“That woman had always been selfish! But, I didn’t think that she would cast greedy eyes on your vehicle.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat aside silently, drinking a cup of water.</p> <p>“She wanted to abandon us. Did she want you to vent your anger on us after finding out that she stole the vehicle?” A man beside Chen Yuting said.</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and said, “If they really stole the car, we wouldn’t let you get away easily.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting and his people stayed silent.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up and walked to them, “Actually, I knew that she didn’t really believe me this morning. Later on, after I took out the vehicle, she still didn’t believe me. So, I’ve kept an eye on her all the way.”</p> <p>While speaking, she returned to the bar, then glanced at her watch. It was two o’clock in the morning.</p> <p>“Forget it! They’ve already been taken care of anyway. So now, we can have some sleep without worrying. You should go find a place to rest. We’ll continue on the way after dawn.”</p> <p>She didn’t worry that Chen Yuting and the others growing evil intentions like Lu Changfeng and her sister, because she had walked past each of them and read their minds. They were shocked by what Lu Ting and Lu Changfeng did, but had no other thoughts.</p> <p>Lin Feng and the others on his side surely knew that Lin Qiao wouldn’t let those people do anything bad, so they had no worries. However, they were indeed concerned about what strange type of energy put them in sleep.</p> <p>At dawn, they got up and made some simple food. The breakfast was still a potful of congee with pork.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen’s space was airless. It was good for keeping food fresh, but didn’t allow her to bring people in.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao entered her space and saw the things stored in the third small space, she understood why Chen Yuting and his people cared so much about Lu Ting. Those people didn’t show their concern for her, but their eyes were always on her, intentionally or not.</p> <p>This time, after hearing that Lin Qiao had killed Lu Ting, they all had strong feelings. However, none of them said anything.</p> <p>After all, stored in Lu Ting’s space were a few tanks of gasoline!</p> <p>Gasoline was very scarce after the apocalypse. No wonder those people cared so much about her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had only used one tank of the total gasoline that she had, and the rest three tanks were still untouched. But now, she had a few more tanks. That was an unexpected harvest.</p> <p>She found that both the second and the third small spaces were airless before merging into her space. But after the merger, these two small spaces were connected with her space and both filled with air.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked around in Lu Ting’s space. Except for the gasoline, she also found some women’s supplies, but nothing else. This space was small, even smaller than the first small space. It was only a little bigger than a bathroom.</p> <p>So, the few tanks of gasoline filled it up almost completely.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked out, prepared to exit her space. But suddenly, a fluffy creature got close to her.</p> <p>She lowered her head and found that it was the gray rabbit.</p> <p>The rabbit had grown big in her space and become fatter! That was reasonable though, as it was feeding on the grasses, strawberries, and vegetables in Lin Qiao’s space!</p> <p>The rabbit rarely approached Lin Qiao. It only ran back to her when Wu Yueling tried to take it away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao bent over, then picked the rabbit up and asked, “What? Why did you come to me? You’re not missing the little one, are you?”</p> <p>Speaking of the little one, she wondered if her father had discovered Yang Chao’s plan. As Lin Qiao thought, that man named Yang Chao was not a good guy. He wanted to hurt Wu Chengyue, and Lin Qiao was fine with that. However, he actually planned to do it by harming Wu Yueling. Because of that, Lin Qiao considered him as an evil man.</p> <p>Besides, based on the fact that he had connived with Lu Tianyu to try biting a chunk of flesh out of Wu Chengyue, Lin Qiao could tell that he liked to play dirty tricks.</p> <p>In a civilian area in the outskirt of Sea City Base, inside a room…</p> <p>The robber leader who escaped from Lin Qiao was wearing a grim look and saying coldly to the other man in the room, “Your leader lied! Killing Hades Base leader’s family? Killing Yuan Tianxing? Those were all lies! I lost eleven brothers! You go and tell your leader to pay me back with his life!”</p> <p>The other man was just a level-six superpowered being, yet he had no fear of the level-seven robber leader. With a faint smile, he responded, “Tang He, calm down! We didn’t think that the mission would cost all of your brothers’ lives. After all, our boss chose to work with you because he believed in your capabilities, isn’t that right? Besides, we can’t get any benefits by entrapping you, can we?”</p> <p>The robber leader who was called Tang He radiated his vibe and made the air pressure around him low. “Then, why didn’t you tell me that there was a level-six zombie in that area? And that it’s a space-powered one! If I knew that, I wouldn’t let it kill all my brothers,” said Tang He, his voice revealing ferocity.</p> <p>The other man shook his head and said, “We honestly didn’t know about that! Besides, the whereabouts of level-six zombies are never certain! They’re so rarely seen. And, you’re a level-seven powerful being. Even if you encountered a zombie king, you would be able to kill it, right?”</p> <p>Tang He looked at him and stayed silent for a few seconds, then said, “It has a space. It can enter the space at any moment it wants. Go ask your leader to try and kill a zombie queen which can disappear at any time. And, it’s not just a zombie king or queen.”</p> <p>If he were right, the strong pressure that he sensed before was from a zombie dominator. If that were true, he really should have sent some people to scout that area first.</p> <p>The energy contained in the nucleus of a zombie dominator was rich enough to send a level-seven superpowered human being straight to level-eight! However, zombie dominators were extremely dangerous. A raging zombie king or queen was able to gather about six-thousand ordinary zombies, but no one knew how many could a zombie dominator summon. That number was probably over ten or twenty thousand.</p> <p>If the leaders of the few large bases learned that a zombie dominator existed in that area, a stir would be caused.</p> <p>The other men clearly didn’t get the point of the latter part of Tang He’s words, but only heard the part about a space-powered zombie.</p> <p>“Space-powered zombies have always been rare. If you bring back its nucleus, you might be able to trade something even better with it,” the man looked at Tang He and said with glowing eyes.</p> <p>Tang He snorted and said, “To get its nucleus, you need to be able to kill it with one move. Otherwise, it might hide in its space forever. What will you do about it then?”</p>",
  "Chapter 300: Yan Fangyu Comes to Visit": "<p>In the morning, when Tang He was meeting with Yang Chao’s people, Yuan Tianxing and his friends had a visitor as well.</p> <p>Du answered the door, confusedly looking at the beautiful lady standing on the threshold as he said, “Eh… Deputy Chief Yan! It’s so early in the morning… Good morning!”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing suddenly didn’t know what to say, as he felt flattered.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu gave him an elegant smile, then responded, “What? Aren’t you gonna let me in? Has your Deputy Chief gotten up yet? I’m really sorry for disturbing you in your sleep.”</p> <p>“No, no, no… It’s okay, it’s totally okay! That… Eh, but you do need to wait for a moment, in case you might see something ugly in here,” Du Yuanxing shook his head in a flurry, then blocked the door as he suddenly thought of something.</p> <p>After saying that to Yan Fangyu, he turned back to yell at the group of men who were walking in the flat naked or only in underwear, “Oi, hurry up! Put some clothes on! We shouldn’t keep the pretty lady waiting!”</p> <p>The others had just gotten up. At the moment, they were mostly holding their toothbrushes, with towels on their shoulders. On hearing the knocks, they sleepily turned to the door. However, after Du Yuanxing called Deputy Chief Yuan, they all woke up completely.</p> <p>So, when Du Yuanxing turned back to yell at them, they were already trying to find their clothes.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing was wearing a white T-shirt before already. On hearing Du Yuanxing’s words, he lowered his head to check himself, but found nothing wrong. So, he directly went to the bathroom to brush his teeth.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later, Du Yuanxing opened the door to let Yan Fangyu in. “Sorry for making you wait! Please come in!”</p> <p>The faint smile on Yan Fangyu’s face didn’t change. Wearing a pair of fancy high heels, she slightly gyrated her hips while walking in.</p> <p>“Please have a seat!” Yuan Tianxing sat down on one of the two armchairs in the living room as he pointed at the other armchair while saying to Yan Fangyu, then pouring her a glass of water.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu surely didn’t come empty-handed, as she had brought a bag. After putting the bag on the tea table, she sat down.</p> <p>“I conveniently brought you some breakfast. I made it myself. Everyone should try it.” While speaking, she opened the bag and let out an aroma of eggs mixing with spring onions.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing smiled politely and said, “Don’t bring any gifts next time, or we’ll feel embarrassed.”</p> <p>Looking at the warm chopped green onion omelet rolls in the bag, the people on the scene who had just gotten up and hadn’t had breakfast yet couldn’t help but swallow their saliva.</p> <p>“Come and eat! I made plenty, as I was worried that it might not be enough for you all,” Yan Fangyu smiled at them and said.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing, Lin Yu, Lu Junjie and the others were all drooling at those omelet rolls, but didn’t dare to move. At last, they reluctantly turned their eyes from the omelet rolls to Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing decided to accept Yan Fangyu’s kindness after inhaling the aroma. “Go get your bowls and chopsticks, help yourself with it,” he said to the others.</p> <p>Once he said that, the others immediately rushed into the kitchen to get their bowls and chopsticks, then crowded around the table and each took two slices.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu’s omelets were in large slices, but still, one slice wasn’t enough for a grown man. Therefore, they each took two slices, then stepped away from Yan Fangyu and Yuan Tianxing, to eat in a quiet corner.</p> <p>In fact, they all went out and squatted in a line outside the door.</p> <p>“It seems that Miss. Yan is really into our boss! She even brought us breakfast so early in the morning!” Du Yuanxing took a bite of the nice-smelling, soft and tasty omelet, then chewed with happiness while speaking.</p> <p>“Even blind people can tell that,” said Lin Yu.</p> <p>“Sadly, our boss doesn’t like her,” said Lu Junjie regretfully.</p> <p>“But, why did she come so early in the morning? Does she need something?”</p> <p>“Who knows?”</p> <p>“She’s a Deputy Chief after all, so I guess she’s actually busy with work. I don’t think she’ll have the time to come here if there’s nothing important.”</p> <p>“You’re right!”</p> <p>The people squatted outside were chatting while eating. In the living room, Yuan Tianxing took two bites of the omelet, and Yan Fangyu didn’t touch the food.</p> <p>“You didn’t come here so early in the morning only to bring me breakfast, did you? Tell me, what’s it about?” Yuan Tianxing looked at Yan Fangyu and asked.</p> <p>Hearing that, the smile in Yan Fangyu’s face faded. She looked at him seriously and said, “I’ve received a message, which is about you, Chief Wu, and the old Hades Base’s leader, Chief Netherworld Fire’s family.”</p> <p>Her words darkened Yuan Tianxing’s face. “What’s the message? Is it about so many of us?”</p> <p>“Yang Chao…” said Yan Fangyu, “He has always been hostile toward Chief Wu, so anyone who has worked with Chief Wu will be targeted by him. This time, he already has his eyes on you. He seems to have found out something about you and Chief Netherworld Fire’s family. Now, he’s preparing to ambush you when you leave our base. Moreover, he has sent some people to go after your friends out there.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing’s face turned slightly cold as he asked, “Is that real?”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu nodded and said, “That message is true. But of course, you can choose to not believe, or confirm it with Chief Wu. I assume he has received the same message as well.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing abruptly stood up as he looked at her and said, “So, are you saying that some people are already going after Lin Feng and his people out there?”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu raised her head to look at him and replied, “That’s right.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing made a fist with his right hand and punched on his left palm, then continued anxiously, “This is bad. Are they in danger now?”</p> <p>“That’s why I came here so early to let you know,” said Yan Fangyu, “You’ll be making further decisions.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at her gratefully and said, “Thank you! I get it! I owe you one.”</p> <p>Seeing that Yan Fangyu was truly a little anxious, Yan Fangyu stood up and said, “I’ll leave then. If you decide to find a way to rescue them, you must be quick.” While speaking, she walked toward the door.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded at her and said, “I know.”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu gave him a pretty smile, then walked to the door and opened it.</p> <p>The five people who were squatted by both sides of the door raised their heads and turned back to look at her simultaneously, then stood up in the next second.</p> <p>“Eh, Deputy Chief Yan, are you leaving?”</p> <p>“Thank you for the breakfast! It’s really delicious!”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu smiled and responded, “I’m not good at cooking. This is my best work. I’m glad that you like it. See you next time!”</p> <p>After saying that, she walked away. While walking, she turned back to smile and wave at the group of men. After the pretty lady looked back at them and smiled at them, the five dazed men gazed at her back as she walked further and further away.</p> <p>A couple of seconds later, when the beautiful Yan Fangyu walked into the elevator, these people finally came back to their senses. As they turned around, they saw Yuan Tianxing’s composed face.</p> <p>“Have you seen enough? Wipe your saliva,” said Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Hearing that, the group of men automatically wiped their mouths.</p>",
  "Chapter 301: Miss Each Other": "<p>About ten seconds later, Yuan Tianxing, Du Yuanxing, Lin Yu, and the others headed to Wu Chengyue’s place.</p> <p>In Wu Chengyue’s house, Meng Yue and Moli were both in Ling Ling’s room. Wu Chengyue, Xiao Yunlong, and Dashu the doctor were sitting in the living room, looking worried.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng suddenly ran into the living room and said, “Chief, Deputy Chief Yuan is here!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue immediately raised his head and responded, “Let him in, hurry!”</p> <p>With that, Xiao Licheng ran out, and Yuan Tianxing walked in alone a few seconds later.</p> <p>Seeing him, Wu Chengyue and the others stood up. Xiao Yunlong stepped away from the armchair that he was sitting on, then pointed at it and said to Yuan Tianxing, “Please have a seat!”</p> <p>Then, he walked aside and dragged over a chair for himself.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing sat down. Seeing the worried look in their faces, he asked with concern, “Isn’t Ling Ling getting better?”</p> <p>The three men shook their heads.</p> <p>Ever since she drank the water provided by Yuan Tianxing, her condition never changed. Currently, she was still in a semi-coma state. Her body temperature had dropped to fifty degrees, but it then stopped changing.</p> <p>No further effects were shown after that, no matter how much more lake water she drank. The awakening of her power had just paused.</p> <p>Liang Dashu tried many ways, but none of those worked.</p> <p>Meng Yue came back as soon as she could after waking up in the hospital. She recovered quickly, but felt very guilty for letting a level-six zombie take Ling Ling away when they were outside. So, she had been with Ling Ling the whole time since she came back.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing said worriedly, “I don’t know what will happen in the end if the situation continues.”</p> <p>His words made the three men wear a sullen look.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue soon managed his expression, then asked, “Sorry for not asking before, but why are you suddenly here?”</p> <p>“There’s something that I need to seek confirmation from you,” said Yuan Tianxing, “I wonder if you have heard that Chief Yang from your base is secretly going after my friends out there?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Chengyue immediately showed a serious look. “Ah, right!” he said, “I heard about that just now. In fact, I had guessed that you were here for this. I heard that Yang Chao has secretly ganged up with a group of robbers out there, and that they’ve made some kind of a deal. Days ago, those robbers headed to where you came from.”</p> <p>“I was going to send someone to let you know,” said Xiao Yunlong, “But, you got the message already.”</p> <p>“So, the message is true?” said Yuan Tianxing anxiously, “Then, Lin Feng and the others are in danger! And, a leader of your base is actually in league with robbers outside. Don’t you have a view about that?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong turned to glance at Wu Chengyue, who said, “Currently, we’re trying our best to collect evidence against him. No matter what view we have about it, without concrete evidence, we won’t be able to do anything to him.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at him speechlessly, as he had no way to disagree that. He then nodded and said, “Alright! Since you’ve confirmed that the message is true, I think I need to make a trip out of your base now. Sorry for bothering you!”</p> <p>While speaking, he stood up and prepared to leave.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and the other two stood up as well. Wu Chengyue waved a hand at him and said, “Wait, I’ll send Yunlong with you. I heard that those robbers who’re working for Yang Chao aren’t just some ordinary robbers. I guess at least two of them are at level-six. You won’t be able to handle them alone!”</p> <p>While speaking, he glanced at Xiao Yunlong, who nodded back. Yuan Tianxing looked at Wu Chengyue with surprise. He didn’t think that Wu Chengyue would send Xiao Yunlong to accompany him.</p> <p>Seeing the look on his face, Wu Chengyue smiled and said, “Please don’t look at me like that. Because of your help, Ling Ling is in a better condition now. I can’t leave her right now, or I’d go out with you myself to find Lin Feng and your other friends. But, I can only ask Xiao Yunlong to do it for me.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded gratefully, “Thank you!”</p> <p>“No need to thank us,” said Xiao Yunlong, “You’re very welcome. Plus, you’ve helped us as well. We should help each other, and we all are not ungrateful people.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and said to Wu Chengyue, “We’ll be leaving then… See you next time!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue walked him to the door while saying, “If anything happens, remember to send someone back to inform me.”</p> <p>“Alright, thank you!” said Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>After watching Yuan Tianxing and Xiao Yunlong walk out, Liang Dashu said, “I wonder what Yang Chao is planning to do to you this time. Aren’t you gonna strike back?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s face turned cold as he said, “I will, after I have solved Ling Ling’s problem. Does he really think that I know nothing?”</p> <p>He knew about many of Yang Chao’s small tricks. He ignored those because they wouldn’t do him any considerable harm. Normally, he only watched Yang Chao like watching a clown.</p> <p>Ling Ling’s condition was the most important thing right now. As for Yang Chao’s plan, he would react to it later.</p> <p>“He’s getting more and more blatant now. He must have found out about Ling Ling’s condition,” said Liang Dashu, “I guess he wants to seize this opportunity to cause you some troubles. You need to be careful.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s face wore a grim expression. The elegance that he was showing just now was gone as he said, “If he dares to hurt Ling Ling, I’ll kill him!” As he said the word ‘kill’, a heavy murderous intention was released from his body.</p> <p>Liang Dashu looked at him, but didn’t say anything else.</p> <p>At that point, Yuan Tianxing, Wu Chengyue, and Yang Chao all had no idea that Lin Feng and his people were arriving at Sea City Base.</p> <p>Two hours later, after entering Sea City Base, Lin Feng and his family learned that Yuan Tianxing and the others had headed out of the base to find them.</p> <p>After getting out of the registry office, Lin Feng and the others seemed to be a little confused.</p> <p>“So, have we missed them?” Cheng Wangxue asked. Lin Feng nodded as he helplessly covered his forehead with a hand. They came all the way here to find Yuan Tianxing, yet he had left. And, they took different routes, so they missed each other.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood beside Lin Feng and said, “Don’t worry about that. I can take some people to find them. You should find a place in this base to settle down for now. By the way, you can also ask around about Yuan Tianxing’s progress here.”</p> <p>People might wonder how she managed to pass all the virus detectors and enter the base. In fact, she had turned herself invisible and directly walked in. No one saw her, and she didn’t need to do any registration. So, the entire Sea City Base didn’t know that she was in the base yet.</p> <p>When Tang He the robber came in, Yang Chao’s people had disguised him.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s words, Lin Feng somehow stopped worrying. “That’s the only way. After all, you’re better than finding people than us,” he said.</p> <p>Standing next to him, Chen Yuting, who had guided them into the base, said, “They should still be nearby. If you go now, you’ll have a good chance of finding them.”</p> <p>As it was the first time for Lin Feng and his people to visit Sea City Base, Chen Yuting and his teammates had shown their hospitality. They first guided their guests to the registry office, then found them temporary accommodation.</p>",
  "Chapter 302: Bring Ling Ling in": "<p>Lin Qiao said to Chen Yuting, “Please take them to the accommodation. I’ll look for you when I’m back.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting nodded at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then turned to speak to Lin Feng, “You don’t need to arrange for my accommodation. I don’t need that. You should be careful in the base, especially the ladies. Earlier on when we came in, I had already sensed quite some eyes with no good intentions.”</p> <p>While speaking, she looked around.</p> <p>The male-female ratio in the base was high, with nine males for one female. Therefore, young and pretty girls would always attract attention, especially newcomers.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Cheng Wangxue were both pretty. Long Qingying’s face was less delicate than theirs, but her skin was nice, and she looked good as well. Mrs. Lin was older than the three of them, yet she was still retaining her graceful bearing. No one could guarantee that the lechers in the base wouldn’t have their eyes on her.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s words, Lin Feng and the others immediately looked around. As she had said, some people were eyeing them in an indescribable way.</p> <p>Long Qingying’s frosty vibe instantly turned even colder. She raised her hand and gripped the hilt of her katana, then scanned around with her eyes which were showing a strong intent of killing.</p> <p>Right after that, half of the people who had been staring at them turned their eyes away.</p> <p>Lin Feng turned back and nodded at Lin Qiao, “I get it.”</p> <p>After parting with the others, Lin Qiao quickly walked toward a public washroom, then turned herself invisible and quietly walked out. When she was heading toward the entrance of the base, Viney’s voice was suddenly heard from her space.</p> <p><em>‘Mama! Mama! Mama!’ </em>Viney sounded very anxious.</p> <p>Lin Qiao paused, then flashed into the space. Once in, she saw that Viney was swinging countless vines in the water, even stirring the entire lake.</p> <p>Liu Jun and Qiu Lili were both sitting on the couch, curiously looking at Viney who suddenly made a stir in the lake. Zombie number one to seven were hiding in the first and the second small spaces, and Mengmeng was hiding in the third small space alone.</p> <p>All the eight zombies had their heads stuck out of the entrances, and were looking at Viney with fright.</p> <p>Once she got on the road, Qiu Lili complained about the dust and asked Lin Qiao to bring her back into the space. After that, Mengmeng immediately found Lin Qiao and raised a claim as well. This time, she didn’t ask Lin Qiao to let Qiu Lili out, but demanded the latter to bring her in as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao asked for Qiu Lili’s opinion, and as the latter didn’t reject, she brought Mengmeng into her space as well.</p> <p>As same as the other zombies, Mengmeng was frightened by Viney as well once she entered the space. Viney didn’t show up, but her vibe still scared Mengmeng.</p> <p>Earlier on, the moment Viney reached out her vines, Mengmeng darted straight into the third small space and refused to come out.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?” Lin Qiao showed up by the lakeside and looked at Viney, who was suddenly flipping out, and asked.</p> <p>Viney immediately reached a vine to her and wrapped her hand, <em>‘Mama! Take me to the little one! The little one! I have felt her! She isn’t in a good condition… Mama, just bring her in here!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the jade-white vine with surprise and asked, “How are you able to feel her? She’s outside.”</p> <p><em>‘The energy inside her body is going to explode soon, </em>‘ said Viney <em>, ‘I sensed her because she’s close. Mama, just go and bring her in here. My energy has been suppressing hers at the moment, but over time, her body will be under too much pressure!’</em></p> <p>While speaking, Viney anxiously waved her vines.</p> <p>Seeing the worried Viney, Lin Qiao had no choice but to agree, “Alright, let me try to find her home first.”</p> <p>She could always catch up with Yuan Tianxing later. According to Viney, the little one seemed to be in a critical condition right now. She also wanted to know what was happening to her.</p> <p>Viney was instantly delighted. <em>‘Mama, hurry up! Hurry up </em>!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao exited her space and turned herself invisible again. She looked around, then chose the tallest building near her to climb up.</p> <p>On the roof, she leaned her head forward to sniff around, and soon grasped the scents of Wu Chengyue and his daughter. After that, she turned and leaped toward their place.</p> <p>The outskirts of the base were less than two miles away from the central area. Lin Qiao quickly entered the central area and found that Wu Chengyue wasn’t living in a fancy apartment or a villa. Instead, he lived in an unimpressive building in a civilian area.</p> <p>She landed on the roof of Wu Chengyue’s place, then sensed quite a few level-five superpowered people who were guarding this building. Wu Chengyue, Meng Yue, Wu Yueling, and two strangers were inside the building.</p> <p>While getting closer, she too had felt the strong and disordered energy inside Wu Yueling’s body. It was familiar to her, as it was just like the explosive energy which emerged inside Lin Xiaolu’s body last time.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Is her power waking up? No way! She’s even younger than Xiaolu. How can she possibly get through this?’</em></p> <p>However, Lin Qiao found Wu Yueling’s energy a little familiar. It seemed to be the same as the energy contained in her lake water, but with something more.</p> <p>At the moment, the restless energy inside the little one’s body seemed to have been suppressed by a familiar type of energy. Wasn’t that the energy from her lake? She could totally recognize it.</p> <p>After sensing the little one’s condition, Lin Qiao directly leaped onto a balcony on the third floor, then walked into the building. Through this study room, she walked to the corridor on the third floor.</p> <p>Ling Ling’s room was on the third floor, and two people were in the room with her. Lin Qiao looked around, then walked to the door of her room.</p> <p>The door was open, and Meng Yue and another woman were in the room.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly walked in, over to the little one’s bedside. She saw that the little girl was covered by a sheet, with her hands and feet exposed in the air.</p> <p>Wu Yueling’s eyes were narrowed and unfocused, and a familiar-looking grass dragonfly was placed on the bedside table. Lin Qiao had made that grass dragonfly, but she didn’t think that the kid was still keeping it.</p> <p>She thought for a moment about what to do. She couldn’t explain anything to Wu Chengyue now, but neither could she sneakily bring the little one away.</p> <p>She pondered briefly, then had an idea. She flashed into her space and found a piece of paper, writing down a line on it.</p> <p>Qiu Lili and the other zombies saw that she showed up suddenly, found a piece of paper from a desk, and wrote something down, then disappeared again.</p> <p>She came out and stood by the bedside, gently holding the little one’s hand. Then, both of them disappeared. After that, a piece of paper fell on the empty bed.</p> <p>The moment Wu Yueling disappeared, Meng Yue and Moli turned to look at the bed simultaneously, but only saw an empty bed.</p>",
  "Chapter 303: It Must be Yang Chao": "<p>“Ling Ling! Where’s Ling Ling!” Meng Yue sprang up and darted to the bed. Looking at the empty bed, Moli’s expressionless face froze as well.</p> <p>At that moment, Meng Yue saw the piece of paper which was falling from the bed. She picked it up and read, ‘I’ll handle Ling Ling’s condition for you. I don’t have the time to explain to you now, so please wait for me to come back! — Lin.’</p> <p>In a couple of seconds, the scurry of feet was heard from the outside. Wu Chengyue showed up by the door and asked, “What happened to Ling Ling? Why is her vibe suddenly gone?”</p> <p>In the next moment, he popped his eyes as he saw the empty bed, his handsome face twisting immediately.</p> <p>“Where’s Ling Ling!”</p> <p>Meng Yue turned back without knowing what to do. Confusedly, she raised the piece of paper in her hand and said, “I don’t know what happened either… Ling Ling suddenly… disappeared… But, a piece of paper showed up…”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue hurriedly walked in and took over the piece of paper to read the note. After that, he forced himself to calm down and analyze the message.</p> <p>“What does this mean? Who took Ling Ling away? Lin? Who’s Lin?”</p> <p>Liang Dashu walked over and read the note, then comforted Wu Chengyue, “Calm down! Maybe this person meant no harm.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gripped the note and closed his eyes for a moment. Then, he stared at the note and said, “It must be Yang Chao! Only a few people know about Ling Ling’s condition! He’ll handle Ling Ling’s condition for us… Am I stupid? How can I possibly believe that!”</p> <p>The air pressure around him turned unstable as a strong intention of killing radiated from him.</p> <p>Unlike him, Liang Dashu, who was by his side, said with composure, “You should calm down for now. First, who is this Lin? We should figure this out before coming to a conclusion. But of course, you can start with Yang Chao and his people. Secondly, I detected no bad intention from this note. This person didn’t threaten you. And, he told us to wait for him to come back, meaning that he will come back to find you. Thirdly…”</p> <p>He paused for a second, then turned to Moli and Meng Yue, “Did you two feel anything the moment Ling Ling disappeared? Calm down and think.”</p> <p>Hearing him, Meng Yue and Moli glanced at each other.</p> <p>Meng Yue cooled herself down and reviewed what happened just now. For a moment, she did sense a vibe, which faded very soon. After that, she raised her head to look at Ling Ling, but the little girl wasn’t there.</p> <p>“That person only showed up for a moment. I think… it should be space power. If that person is merely able to be invisible, he or she can’t possibly pick Ling Ling up and turn her invisible without letting us feel anything,” said Moli.</p> <p>“I didn’t sense any evil intent or negative emotion. On the contrary, I grasped a trace of anxiety, and confusion from another individual. I think they only learned about Ling Ling’s condition after arriving here. I don’t think they knew that clearly before they got here. As for why they’re anxious… Chief, I think you should think about the people who’re nice to Ling Ling. Except for the ones in this house, who else will be kind to her? Maybe, we should think positively.”</p> <p>As Moli finished talking blandly, Wu Chengyue calmed down for a little. While rereading the note, he suddenly had a guess.</p> <p>Lin? A space-powered being? Didn’t he run into someone like that before returning to the base?</p> <p>He immediately recalled the woman who stole his zombie king nucleus in West Lake District in Hangzhou. He had fought her and lost!</p> <p>Moreover, he had given her a bite!</p> <p>That woman was able to turn herself invisible, and had a space! Did she take Ling Ling away?</p> <p>“I’ll go find someone,” said Wu Chengyue abruptly as he quickly walked toward the outside. He was going to find Lu Tianyi and ask if he knew anything about that woman!</p> <p>As he suddenly turned and left, the others immediately followed him out.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao scooped Wu Yueling up after bringing her into the space.</p> <p>“Little thing?” She lowered her head to look at the little girl’s half-narrowed eyes while calling her with a gentle voice. However, the little one didn’t give her any response.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment, then knelt on one knee and put the little girl on her lap. She supported the girl’s body with one hand and took off her hat and sunglasses with the other.</p> <p>Looking at the little one with her dark-green eyes, she tried to call her again, “Little thing, do you know who I am?”</p> <p>Magically, the look in the little girl’s eyes changed slightly this time. But right after the short gleam, those eyes turned dull again, and showed no other changes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao carried her up and walked to the lakeside, then said to Viney, “Viney, the little one’s power is waking up. What should we do?”</p> <p>Viney reached out a few arm-thick vines and gently wrapped up Wu Yueling’s body with three of them, then touched Lin Qiao with another.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, don’t worry! I’ll help her to trigger her power…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then let Viney bring Wu Yueling down into the lake.</p> <p>Liu Jun and Qiu Lili walked to Lin Qiao’s side. Neither of them knew Wu Yueling, so they asked curiously, “Is that the little one that you and Viney had mentioned earlier? Whose kid is she? What’s wrong with her?”</p> <p>“She’s the little princes of Sea City Base. I don’t know why, but her power suddenly began waking up as well,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Little princess? Is she the daughter of a Chief? Do you and Viney both know her?” asked Liu Jun. She understood that Lin Qiao wouldn’t bring the little princess here without a good reason and ask Viney to help her, and that Viney shouldn’t have feelings toward the people from the outside either.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “We do. We met her before meeting you two. In fact, that was a trouble caused by the previous owner of my body.”</p> <p>Liu Jun and Qiu Lili looked at her with curiosity. However, Lin Qiao didn’t plan to tell them more. Instead, she said, “I’ll tell you the story when we have time. Right now, we need to leave the base to find Yuan Tianxing.”</p> <p>“Eh?” Liu Jun and Qiu Lili looked at her with surprise, “Isn’t Yuan Tianxing in Sea City Base? Where did he go?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook his head and said, “He isn’t here. We’ve checked the exit record. They left two hours ago. Right now, we need to find them.”</p> <p>Liu Jun and Qiu Lili glanced at each other without knowing what to say.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched Viney bring Wu Yueling into the water. She was still a little worried, but thankfully, Viney had helped with the awakening of Lin Xiaolu’s power the last time. So, she guessed that it would be all right this time as well.</p> <p>Knowing that she wouldn’t be able to help here, Lin Qiao turned and left the space, heading toward the outside. She hoped that she could find Yuan Tianxing and the others as soon as possible.</p>",
  "Chapter 304: Mama, Help Me": "<p>However, not long after she exited the base, Viney’s voice was suddenly heard from her space.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, get in here! Mama, get in!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao had no choice but to flash back in immediately.</p> <p>“What’s wrong? Viney?” She stood by the lakeside and asked toward the lake.</p> <p>A vine reached out of the lake and coiled around her hand. Then, she heard Viney say, <em>‘Mama, the energy inside the little one’s body has been suppressed for too long… I can’t control it fully now… Mama, come down and help.’</em></p> <p>“How can I help down there?” Lin Qiao asked with surprise. She didn’t know how to help others trigger their powers.</p> <p>“Didn’t you help Xiaolu trigger her power successfully the last time? Why can’t you do it this time?” Lin Qiao continued asking.</p> <p>Viney thought for a moment, then responded, <em>‘Em, Sister Xiaolu’s condition only lasted for a short while, so I was able to control her energy. But this time, the little one has been in this condition for days… Her power had been suppressed the whole time, but there were negative effects of that as well… She has too much energy in her body right now… I’m worrying that her tiny body might not be able to take it…’</em></p> <p>Hearing Viney’s explanation, Lin Qiao got a little anxious as well, “What should we do then? Do you know how to help her when I get down there?”</p> <p><em>‘Mama, come down… I’ll transfer a part of the little one’s power into your body, so that she’ll be safer…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Alright then!”</p> <p>“Wait a moment!” She thought for a moment and then suddenly added. “Lili, come over here,” she turned and waved at Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Qiu Lili and Liu Jun were sitting on the couch and watching her. As Lin Qiao waved her, Qiu Lili immediately stood up and flashed to her side.</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her and said, “I’m going down in the lake to help Viney, so I can’t go find Yuan Tianxing now. You’re the fastest among us, as you have the wind power. Can you go out to find Yuan Tianxing and the others for me?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili knew Yuan Tianxing and his people, and they knew her as well. Therefore, Lin Qiao felt that it would be appropriate for the former to go instead of her, as she couldn’t make it herself.</p> <p>As a level-seven wind-powered zombie, Qiu Lili was many times faster than even a racing car now. She could directly fly to Yuan Tianxng from a treetop.</p> <p>Qiu Lili thought shortly, then nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll go!”</p> <p>“Roar!” ‘I’ll go too!’</p> <p>At that moment, Mengmeng, who had been hiding in the third small space, suddenly leaped out and gave a roar. Meanwhile, she had been carefully staring at Viney in the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “There’s no time to waste. I’ll send you out now.”</p> <p>While speaking, she immediately reached out her hands, grabbed the two young female zombies, and flashed out of her space with them. After dropping them outside, she came back right in.</p> <p>Once out, Qiu Lili hopped onto the tallest treetop while Mengmeng looked at her on the ground. Then, Qiu Lili started moving fleetingly and Mengmeng followed her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao entered her space and prepared to take off her clothes. But before that, she thought of something and glanced back. The few zombies had stuck their heads out of a small space to look at her.</p> <p>“Get in,” Lin Qiao shouted at them, “If you dare to watch me take off clothes, I’ll tell Viney to drag you all into the lake.”</p> <p>Once she said that, those zombies disappeared from her sight without a trace.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao stripped herself and walked into the water. When she took off her clothes, Liu Jun covered Tong Tong’s eyes and carried him to a farther place.</p> <p>Lin Qiao got into the water and sensed the waving energy in the lake. When she reached to the deeper area, Viney wrapped her waist with a vine which was as thick as a baby arm to bring her down.</p> <p>Down in the water, Lin Qiao saw that Wu Yueling was entirely wrapped in Viney’s vines, encased in a tiny cocoon. The cocoon was glowing brightly; the white light shone out of the cocoon and made it look like a flaring egg.</p> <p>It looked adorable, but contained an agitated energy which made Lin Qiao feel danger. For Lin Qiao, the feeling wasn’t strong, but for Wu Yueling, it should be extremely intense.</p> <p>At that point, Viney reached five or six vines to Lin Qiao and wrapped her up into a larger cocoon. Then, she brought the large and the small cocoons together.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao started to sense a stream of energy slowly entering her body.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Wu Chengyue had sent Xiao Licheng to investigate Yang Chao’s recent moves, to see if he had sent people after Ling Ling. Meanwhile, he sent someone else to check the entry and exit records for the recent couple of days, and list the names of all suspicious people for him.</p> <p>“Where’re you going?” As Wu Chengyue said that he was going to find someone, Meng Yue followed behind her and asked with confusion.</p> <p>“Special Region C,” Wu Chengyue responded.</p> <p>“Special C? Are you going to find someone on Chief Zou’s side?” Meng Yue asked curiously.</p> <p>The inner area of Sea City Base was divided into three regions—Special Region A, B, C. These were the areas where the high-ranked people lived and worked. Meanwhile, the outer area was divided into seven regions—Region A to F. Each one of these regions included living quarters, working areas, and administrative regions.</p> <p>Special Region A was under Wu Chengyue’s administration, and was also where he lived. Special Region B was administrated by Yang Chao, and Special Region C was Zou Shihui’s territory.</p> <p>Therefore, once Wu Chengyue mentioned that he was heading to Special Region C, the others understood that he was going to find someone under Zou Shihui’s command. The people who lived in Special Region C were mostly Zou Shihui’s subordinates, and some general staff who worked for him.</p> <p>In the hall of an office building in Special Region C, Wu Chengyue sent Meng Yue to ask someone if Lu Tianyi was in the office. A couple of minutes later, she came back and said, “Lu Tianyi isn’t in the office. He had gone to the greenhouse. We need to find him there.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Chengyue turned and moved to leave while saying, “Let’s go to the greenhouse.”</p> <p>The greenhouse was the source of ninety percent of the food in the whole base. It contained planning areas and livestock areas.</p> <p>A large part of Special Region C was actually farmlands. However, due to the problems of natural earth and water, it required superpowered people to make the plants grow healthily. Anyway, they were greatly understaffed, and hence, the harvest wasn’t satisfactory.</p> <p>A rich harvest could be expected when green-powered people hastened the growth of plants. However, green-powered people were too rare.</p> <p>When Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming were hastening the growth and watering the plants in the greenhouse, a man ran in and shouted at them, “Boos, Chief Wu is here to see you.”</p> <p>The two of them turned around and recognized the man as one of their subordinates from a workshop.</p> <p>“Why’s Chief Wu here to see you?” Kong Qingming turned to look at Lu Tianyi and asked with surprise. The latter shook his head confusedly and responded, “How am I supposed to know? Let’s go out and find out.”</p> <p>While speaking, he washed his hands in a sphere of water which was floating in the air and wrapping his hands. Kong Qingming got close to him and reached out his hands which had some earth and leaves on them as he said, “Give me some too.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi raised one hand with his palm down, and put a clean sphere of water upon the other’s hands. Kong Qingming washed his hands clean in the floating water, then walked out of the greenhouse with Lu Tianyi.</p>",
  "Chapter 305: What Kind of Person": "<p>There was a rough shed outside the greenhouse to shade people from the sunlight, and for them to rest underneath during breaks. At this moment, Wu Chengyue and the others were standing in the shed, looking around at the crops in the surroundings.</p> <p>At that moment, Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming came out of the greenhouse and walked toward them.</p> <p>“Chief Wu, is there an emergency, considering you came all the way here to find me?” Lu Tianyi greeted Wu Chengyue and said. Actually, Special Region A was pretty far from Special Region C. It would take about half an hour to travel between these two regions on foot, and it was noontime now, with scorching sunlight hammering down on all existences.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned to look at him, then looked around again. Seeing no other people nearby, he asked, “Can you please tell me how much you know about the woman named Lin you met in Hangzhou?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi looked at him with surprise, asking, “Eh? Why are you suddenly asking about her?” While saying that, he wondered if Chief Wu had already found out that woman was no one else but Lu Tianyu, and that if he was collecting information about her so he could go after her later.</p> <p>With these thoughts, Lu Tianyi’s heart sank slightly. However, his face showed no change of expression.</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Chengyue took out a piece of paper and handed to Lu Tianyi while speaking, “I want you to confirm if this is her handwriting.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi took over the note curiously and read it, but the handwriting on it was strange to him.</p> <p>He was surely able to recognize Lu Tianyu’s handwriting. That wasn’t as sharp as the handwriting on the paper. This note was clearly written by someone else.</p> <p>“Who wrote this?” Lu Tianyi asked with confusion, “And, what does this mean? Was Ling Ling taken away again?”</p> <p>No one should blame him for using the word ‘again’. After all, the whole base knew that Ling Ling was often taken away by bad people. But, she miraculously made it back every time, and was perfectly unharmed.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s face darkened slightly as he said, “She left this note. I want to know what’s your relationship with her, and how much you know about her… Also, what kind of person she is.”</p> <p><em>‘She is not a person!’</em></p> <p>Lu Tianyi said that in his head while smiling and responding to Wu Chengyue, “Are you sure this is from her? And, please tell me where Ling Ling was taken away from?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue said, “She has a space, and is traceless. Except for the woman that I met last time, no one else can take Ling Ling away under my watch!”</p> <p>That woman had silently stolen her zombie nucleus. Judging by that, he could tell that she took Ling Ling away in the same way this time.</p> <p>On his way here, Wu Chengyue had been calmly thinking about what had happened. The more he thought about the space-powered woman that he met in Hangzhou, the deeper he believed that it was she who took his daughter away.</p> <p>If he were right, she wouldn’t harm Ling Ling this time, as she had already saved her once. However, he couldn’t figure out why she stole Ling Ling from his place just like that.</p> <p>What a weird woman!</p> <p><em>‘Damn! If you want to save my daughter, can’t you first tell me frankly about it? Why did you steal her? Are you trying to scare me to death? </em>‘ he thought.</p> <p>After thinking through, Wu Chengyue stopped worrying. As long as she didn’t work for Yang Chao, Ling Ling should be safe.</p> <p>So, he now wanted to make another thing clear.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi thought for a moment, then felt that Wu Chengyue’s words made sense. Abruptly, he murmured to himself, “So… is she back in the base?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and the other looked at him, as they didn’t know what he meant.</p> <p>“You know her superpower, and you should also know why she took Ling Ling away. I want to say that no doctor or healing-powered people can help Ling Ling’s current condition. Does that woman named Lin know how to help her?” asked Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi raised his head to look at him, recalling Lin Qiao’s space and the lake.</p> <p>“She has a… magical lake! Eh, in fact, I can’t tell how exactly she’s going to help Ling Ling. I’m not clear about Ling Ling’s condition either. So, I can’t tell for sure,” Lu Tianyi pointed at the note, then continued, “She seems to be quite clear about what Ling Ling is going through. Even you can’t do anything about that?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked around. After confirming that no suspicious people existed in the surrounding, he said, “After we returned to the base, Ling Ling’s power suddenly began awakening. We got a special kind of water from someone else, which suppressed the energy inside her body. However, it has been a few days, and Ling Ling’s condition hasn’t been getting any better. But thankfully, it was not getting worse either.”</p> <p>Hearing his words, both Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming popped their eyes in shock. “What? Her power is awakening!” They exclaimed with disbelief, then glanced at each other to make sure that they hadn’t misheard. After that, Lu Tianyi asked, “How can that be possible? She’s so young! Why is her power awakening?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue sighed and replied, “I want to know that too. But, that woman named Lin took Ling Ling away. Where can we find her now?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi looked at him and said, “Ah… Chief, if you ask me that… To be honest, I don’t know. In fact, she told me earlier that she won’t come back to Sea City base, so I don’t know why she suddenly appeared here. Perhaps, we can only find out when she shows up in person.”</p> <p>While speaking, he silently sighed in relief, as Wu Chengyue didn’t seem to have figured out that woman’s true identity.</p> <p>Hearing Lu Tianyi’s words, Wu Chengyue’s heart sank. However, his handsome face showed no expression.</p> <p>Right at that moment, Xiao Licheng ran over.</p> <p>“Chief, we got something!”</p> <p>The others immediately turned to him. He glanced at Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming, then hesitated for a while.</p> <p>“It’s alright, just tell me,” said Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Hearing him, Xiao Licheng took out a piece of paper, which had a name list on it.</p> <p>“A group of people came back this morning,” he said, “It’s Chen Yuting and his people from the Feng Ting Squad. However, the other squad leader of theirs, Lu Changfeng, and his younger sister, Lu Ting, as well as two other squad members are missing. Another group of people came with them. The leader of those people is named Lin Feng. They’re here to find Deputy Chief Yuan.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue both looked at him with surprise. “What did you say? Lin Feng? Are they from the old Hades Base too?” Wu Chengyue asked.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi didn’t know about Yuan Tianxing and Lin Feng. So, he glanced at Kong Qingming confusedly. Unlike him, Kong Qingming knew a little about Yuan Tianxing and the Hades Base.</p> <p>“Eh?” he said, “Are you talking about Yuan Tianxing who has released a task in the Mission Hall, which is about building a new base in the center of Hangzhou? I heard that he’s making great offers. However, he needs people to work for him in the center of a zombie city. Many people went to ask about that job, but most of them came back.”</p> <p>From Kong Qingming’s words, Lu Tianyi learned about what Yuan Tianxing was doing here. However, he couldn’t understand what his sister had to do with the people from the old Hades Base.</p>",
  "Chapter 306: The Entry and Exit Record": "<p>Hearing Xiao Licheng’s words, Wu Chengyue took over the list and gave it a look. As the former had mentioned, quite a few people on the list had the last name ‘Lin’.</p> <p>“Eh? Why are they in our base? Didn’t people say that someone had already made moves on them out there? And, Yuan Tianxing left the base this morning, so why didn’t they meet on the road?” Wu Chengyue asked.</p> <p>Except for Wu Chengyue and Liang Dashu, the others on the scene didn’t know that Yang Chao had sent people after Yuan Tianxing and his people yet. So, on hearing his words, the others immediately figured that something was happening.</p> <p>“They have probably taken different routes,” said Xiao Licheng, “As for why Lin Feng and his people showed up here, we don’t know that yet. But, we are now at least sure that no one has done anything to them like you said, Chief. Or… some people might have tried to hurt them, but failed.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue read the name list and tried to find the Lin woman from it. The ages of those people were also on the paper, so, after reading the name list carefully, Wu Chengyue only found a girl named Lin Wenwen who was likely to be the woman that he had met.</p> <p>“Is this Lin Wenwen in our base now?” He pointed at Lin Wenwen’s name and asked. If she were the one who took his daughter away, she shouldn’t be in the base right now. But, if she was in the base, was Ling Ling with her?</p> <p>Xiao Licheng nodded and said, “She is in the base. None of the people on the list have left so far.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s face darkened slightly as he turned to look at Xiao Licheng and said, “Are you saying that this woman is still in our base?”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng nodded, but as he suddenly thought of something, he continued, “Ah, Huang Ming is back, and he’s with Lin Feng and the others. Li Zheng and his people who left earlier with Huang Ming’s team have also come back together with them.”</p> <p>“Had they found Lin Feng and his people?” Wu Chengyue asked with surprise.</p> <p>“I think so,” said Xiao Licheng, “Otherwise, they wouldn’t come back to our base together.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue immediately turned around and said, “Let’s go find Lin Wenwen now, and also meet the others!”</p> <p>After saying that, he left with his people.</p> <p>So, Lu Tianyi, who was called out of the greenhouse, confusedly watched Wu Chengyue and his people quickly leave to find that woman named Lin Wenwen before he could even figure out what was going on.</p> <p>He was puzzled. What did those Hades Base people have to do with his sister? Was this because of the last name ‘Lin’?</p> <p>Lu Tianyi thought that Lin Qiao addressed herself as ‘Lin’ in front of Wu Chengyue, because she didn’t want him to know her real name. However, it was unexpected that Wu Chengyue connected this last name with some people from another base.</p> <p>Kong Qingming, who had been paying attention to everyone the whole time, now had his left arm before his chest and right elbow resting on his left hand while rubbing his chin with his right hand. Meanwhile, he had been curiously looking at Wu Chengyue and his people who were leaving in haste.</p> <p>“It seems that some people are starting a trouble. They’re actually targeting Chief Wu! It’s not the one from your family, is it…?”</p> <p>After all, she did have a space, which made Kong Qingming’s guess a very real possibility.</p> <p>“How am I supposed to know?” Lu Tianyi asked.</p> <p>Kong Qingming dropped both arms and clapped his hands, then said, “I’ll go find it out. You’ll be doing the rest of the work.”</p> <p>While speaking, he patted Lu Tianyi on his shoulder, and then followed behind Wu Chengyue and the others.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi, who was left there to work alone, was a little speechless. <em>‘I know that you’re expecting a great show, but can you not make it so obvious? </em>‘ he thought.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao, who was in the lake, sensed a suction force which was pumping her energy out of her brain, while feeling a strange energy flowing into her body. She believed that Viney wouldn’t harm her, so she let the force take her energy without trying to stop it.</p> <p>Viney extracted Lin Qiao’s energy, then tried to pull away the agitated energy inside Wu Yueling’s body with her own power. The little one’s energy had mostly been gathering toward her brain. A part of it was pulled out by Viney and sent into Lin Qiao’s body.</p> <p>If Lin Qiao weren’t there to serve as a transitional body, the energy inside Wu Yueling’s body would have probably exploded. Viney would have tried her best to pull that energy out, but that would have still been too dangerous. After all, once Viney failed to control that energy well, it would blow up.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Yuan Tianxing and his people drove two refitted off-road vehicles out of Sea City and entered Jiaxing City. While they were driving, a white figure suddenly descended from the sky and stopped them.</p> <p>Squeak! Du Yuanxing slammed the brakes, causing a shrill noise. His head almost hit against the steering wheel, and the others in the car all reeled right and left.</p> <p>“Ouch… My neck… Du, can you please warn us next time before you slam the brakes…” Lin Yu had his head bumped into the back of the driver’s seat. After that, he tilted his head and said through clenched teeth.</p> <p>“Damn! Do you think I wanted to do that? We’re driving at eighty miles per hour, but someone suddenly showed up in front of our car! It was already amazing that I managed to stop the car!” Du Yuanxing responded, a bit startled as well. But, after seeing the white figure before the car clearly, he continued with surprise, “Eh? Isn’t that Qiu Lili?”</p> <p>“Who’s Qiu Lili?” Lin Yu twisted his neck and asked.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing, who was in the front seat, opened the car door and got off. As he got out of the car, Du Yuanxing and the others followed. Behind them, Xiao Yunlong parked his car two meters away, then came out of the car with his people.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing was happy upon seeing Qiu Lili. He hurriedly walked to her and asked anxiously, “Why’re you here? Where’re Lin Feng and the others?”</p> <p>Watching him coming over excitedly, Qiu Lili took two slight steps backward. Her movement reminded Yuan Tianxing that she didn’t like to be close to humans.</p> <p>“You don’t need to go back. The people that you’ve been looking for are in Sea City Base now,” Qiu Lili raised her head to look at Yuan Tianxing with her pair of pretty dark-red eyes while speaking. After saying that, she pushed off the ground and hopped onto the roof of Yuan Tianxing’s car.</p> <p>Following his move, everybody turned their eyes to the car roof.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing was puzzled at first, then understood her meaning. He raised his head and said with surprise, “Are you saying that Lin Feng and the others are in Sea City Base now? How come I didn’t know that?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili picked up her long twin-tails, rolling them with her hands while replying, “They arrived half an hour ago. At that time, you had left the base for two hours. So, I came here to get you back.”</p> <p>Hearing her words, Yuan Tianxing finally stopped worrying. “So, they’re all fine, right?” he asked.</p> <p>“They’re fine,” Qiu Lili nodded.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing sighed with relief and said, “Ah, great! I heard that some people were going after them. I was worried that something might happen to them, so I decided to make a trip back to check on them. It surprises me that they’re in the base already.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili shook her head and said, “Alright, I’ve found you. You get back as soon as possible.”</p> <p>Finishing talking, she abruptly turned around to stick out her tongue toward Xiao Yunlong, who was on the other side, and then disappeared without a trace.</p>",
  "Chapter 307: Stop Yuan Tianxing": "<p>Xiao Yunlong was a little confused when Qiu Lili pulled a face at him. He silently calmed his power which was preparing in his palm, then walked to Yuan Tianxing and asked with a confused look, “If I was right, her eyes…”</p> <p>Those were zombie eyes, with ruby-like pupils. The owner of those eyes was a zombie queen at least, or even a higher-leveled being.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing finally noticed the nervous Xiao Yunlong. He saw that the latter’s entire body had been tightened up, probably because he was preparing to make a move ever since he saw Qiu Lili. Yuan Tianxing guessed that Xiao Yunlong had refrained from launching an attack because he saw him talking to Qiu Lili.</p> <p>“Ugh, relax, relax! Don’t worry, she’s not gonna hurt us,” Yuan Tianxing hurriedly said to Xiao Yunlong with a smile. The latter still looked at him in surprise while saying, “Do you mean that… she’s really a…”</p> <p>He wished that the truth wasn’t like what he thought. That girl could talk, so he guessed that he was wrong…</p> <p>Seeing the shocked and confused look on this tall and sturdy man’s face, Yuan Tianxing grinned and said, “That’s right, it’s like what you’re thinking. But, I am now relaxed after seeing her. She showed up here, which means Lin Feng and the others are truly fine.”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu had told him that Yang Chao had secretly sent some people after Lin Feng and the others. Yang Chao wouldn’t just send one or two people, and the people he sent would be no weaker than level-six superpowered beings. Facing those kinds of enemies, Lin Feng and his people were truly defenseless.</p> <p>Even knowing that Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili were with them, Yuan Tianxing was still worried, because it was hard to defend against the enemies that one didn’t know. If those people had launched a surprise attack, even Qiu Lili might not have been able to protect everyone. Besides, Lin Qiao had left for the center of Hangzhou City, and Yuan Tianxing didn’t know if she had returned yet.</p> <p>So, at the moment, the strongest ones among the whole group of people were Lin Feng and Qiu Lili.</p> <p>They would be able to deal with one or two level-six superpowered people. However, the ones who were working for Yang Chao were robbers, who had plenty of ways to hurt people. They were all cruel and heartless, and considerably strong. The people who were able to survive in the open post-apocalyptic world were very dangerous.</p> <p>“Are you saying that… she’s what I think she is? Are you sure?” Xiao Yunlong was still wearing that bewildered look. Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “That’s right. She’s a zombie queen. But… could she always talk? I’ve only heard her roaring before.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong popped his eyes to look at Yuan Tianxing, then glanced at his subordinates. “Why can you talking about that so calmly?” he asked, “Don’t you think that… a talking zombie is… ugh… very strange?”</p> <p>The ones who wore the same look as Xiao Yunlong were his subordinates, and had their heads sticking out of the car windows.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing smilingly nodded and said, “Ah, yeah, very strange indeed! But, we’ve already been shocked about half a month ago. Alright, we should head back.”</p> <p>After saying that, he patted Xiao Yunlong on his shoulder, then turned and got into the car. Du Yuanxing and the others instantly came back into the car as well. Then, the car was started and turned around.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong was left stunned, as he could scarcely believe what he had just heard.</p> <p>“I think we should go back and fix our world view…” He turned to look at his subordinates in the car and said, the latter all nodding in response.</p> <p>At that point, Yuan Tianxing’s car was turned around and stopped by his side.</p> <p>“Chief Xiao, I hope that you won’t tell anyone else about Lili for now. I believe that in the near future, everyone will find out about them,” Yuan Tianxing stuck his head out of the car window and said to Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong recovered from the shock and responded confusedly, “Near future? Why?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing only smiled, but didn’t say a word before pulling his head back into the car. Then, the car was driven where it came from, raising a cloud of dust in its wake.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong watched Yuan Tianxing’s car drive away, then turned back to make another eye-contact with his people. After that, he got into his car.</p> <p>“I think I need a moment of quiet!” he said.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the space, Lin Qiao didn’t know how long it had been. She felt utterly uncomfortable, as her whole body was burning. The energy inside her head had been endlessly taken away by Viney, while a strange energy was entering her body.</p> <p>Over time, she felt that a magical power was flowing into her body along with that strange energy.</p> <p>If she were right, that power was a type of life-force.</p> <p>That guess gave Lin Qiao a start. <em>‘It’s not the little one’s life-force, is it? Why is her life-force flowing into my body? Will anything happen to her if she’s sharing her life-force with me?’</em></p> <p>Once she turned anxious, that life-force stopped entering her body, and so did the strange energy. Then, she sensed a sudden expansion of energy next to her, and right after that, the energy shrank.</p> <p>As everything in the surroundings calmed back down, Viney’s vines slowly unwrapped her. Only one vine was left coiling around her waist.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and saw the little person in front of her.</p> <p>The little one had her eyes closed, her long hair spreading in the water. A faintly-colored crystal piece was disappearing before her forehead. To be specific, it was sinking into her forehead.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao heard Viney’s voice, <em>‘Mama, you bring the little one go up. I’m so tired… I need to sleep…’</em></p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao felt that both her and Wu Yueling were sent upward. Soon, their heads were out of the water. Viney sent them up to the water surface, then uncoiled them. Afterward, all the vines drew back toward the lake bottom.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hurriedly put an arm around Wu Yueling, then supported her body with one arm while swimming toward the lakeside.</p> <p>By the lakeside, Liu Jun was waiting for them with two large towels. As Lin Qiao walked out of the water with the little girl, she first covered the girl’s body with one towel, then put another towel around Lin Qiao’s shoulders.</p> <p>Lin Qiao handed Wu Yueling to Liu Jun and said, “She’s fine now. Put her on a bed.”</p> <p>Liu Jun took over the girl, but didn’t leave immediately. Instead, she looked at Lin Qiao with confusion. The latter was wrapping the towel around her body to dry herself. Seeing the look in Liu Jun’s face, she paused to look at her.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?”</p> <p>Liu Jun put his nose near Lin Qiao, then sniffed at her then said, “I feel… a little weird. Maybe something is wrong with my nose.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was confused by him. She raised an arm and sniffed herself as well, but sensed no strange smell.</p> <p>“What is wrong? You look so puzzled.”</p> <p>Liu Jun took a step backward and spent a short while staring at Lin Qiao and thinking. After that, she replied, “Um, your power has improved again! I feel that this rapid improvement isn’t really a good thing.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a moment to feel the energy inside her body, then nodded and agreed, “Yeah, my energy is getting a little unstable.”</p>",
  "Chapter 308: You’re Getting Stronger Again": "<p>The energy inside her head now was mostly from Wu Yueling, and not much of her own energy was left inside her body. This might be the reason why the energy inside her brain was extra active, and caused some instability.</p> <p>Liu Jun turned and carried Wu Yueling to a couch, still wearing a confused look. Except for the unstable energy, there was another thing strange about Lin Qiao, but she didn’t mention it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s vibe had changed again. It was added with a strange scent, which was different from Lin Qiao’s zombie scent. Lin Qiao’s vibe now contained some kind of vitality, but not as fresh and alive as the vibes of humans.</p> <p>Judging by Lin Qiao’s reaction just now, she didn’t seem to realize that herself. Also, the new scent of Lin Qiao was a little like that of Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little confused while watching Liu Jun leave. She sniffed at herself again, then began putting clothes on.</p> <p>After quickly dressing herself, she walked to Liu Jun.</p> <p>“How long have we spent down there?” she asked.</p> <p>Liu Jun told Tong Tong to go and play, as he was getting bored beside her by himself. After that, she held Wu Yueling in her arms while toweling the little girl’s hair. Hearing Lin Qiao’s question, she glanced at her watch and said, “About three days.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was surprised by that answer. “It’s been three days? So long? No wonder Viney was so exhausted that she even wanted to sleep.”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded.</p> <p>“Ugh, Lili and the others should have returned, right? I think I should send the little one back to her father first. I only left a note while bringing her in. We don’t know what that man might do,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>She suddenly realized that Qiu Lili wouldn’t enter the space after bringing Yuan Tianxing and the others back.</p> <p>While thinking, she walked to the couch and saw that Liu Jun had dried Wu Yueling’s hair a little. Her hair weren’t completely dry yet, but they had stopped dripping water at least.</p> <p>The little one was fine now, even though she was still in sleep; she would wake up as a healthy little girl soon.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the closet, found a large T-shirt, and put it on Wu Yueling.</p> <p>“I’ll go out to bring Lili in, then send this little one back,” she said.</p> <p>Liu Jun looked at her and nodded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned and flashed out, after which, she turned herself invisible and hopped onto a building in the outskirts of the base, then stood on the roof to sense Qiu Lili and Mengmeng’s location.</p> <p>After locating them, she directly leaped toward that direction.</p> <p>Qiu Lili and Mengmeng weren’t far away, only hundreds of meters from the fence wall of the base. One of them was able to turn invisible, while the other one was at an amazingly high level. So, as they restrained their vibes, not even the three level-seven superpowered beings in the base could sense them.</p> <p>Before long, Lin Qiao showed up in front of them.</p> <p>Qiu Lili and Mengmeng were squatting on the top floor of a building, silently counting the ants in that corridor.</p> <p>“I wonder what’s happening to Qiao. It has been three days, but she’s still in there,” Qiu Lili pouted and said while driving the ants that were deviating from the ant group back into the crowd with a stick.</p> <p>“Roar!” Mengmeng abruptly roared at her. ‘She brought the little girl in!’</p> <p>“Yeah, we don’t know who that little kid is. Why did Qiao save her?”</p> <p>“Roar!” Mengmeng growled unhappily. ‘I’ve seen that little girl before. Last time, she took her away from me.’</p> <p>Qiu Lili looked at her with surprise while saying, “Eh? When were you with that little girl?”</p> <p>This time, Mengmeng didn’t say anything, but quietly stared at the ants on the ground.</p> <p>“Eh?” Qiu Lili looked at her confusedly. As Mengmeng refused to say another word, she lowered her head to continue counting ants. Then, she found that the little ant which she had just sent back into the crowd was now running away again.</p> <p>Next, Lin Qiao showed up before the two of them and said, “She stole that little girl when I was in Hangzhou. If I hadn’t seen them, that little thing would have suffered severely while living with her.”</p> <p>Once she showed up, Qiu Lili and Mengmeng both raised their heads to look at her, then sprung up from the ground.</p> <p>“Wow! You’re finally out! Eh? You’re stronger again!” Upon seeing her, Qiu Lili was happy at first. But then, she confusedly made two circles around the other, observing her from head to toe.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then raised a hand and spread her fingers while responding, “Sort of. My level remained the same, but I’m feeling that my body has indeed become stronger.” While speaking, she abruptly swung an arm toward the outside.</p> <p>A shrill swishing noise was heard, after which, a corner of the building in the front suddenly tilted, then slowly fell to the ground.</p> <p>Boom! The building corner smashed into the ground from the height, falling into pieces and stirring up a cloud of dust.</p> <p>Lin Qiao measured the distance with her eyes and found that building was at least twenty meters away from her.</p> <p>Qiu Lili and Mengmeng both spent a moment staring at her with surprise, then turned toward the building which now had a corner missing. The cut surface on the building was strangely smooth, as if that corner was cut off by a giant knife as easily as cutting a piece of tofu.</p> <p>“That’s not a zombie claw anymore! Why can you cut off things so far away? Why can’t I do the same?” Qiu Lili enviously said to her, then raised her claw and swung toward the outside as well; however, nothing happened.</p> <p>Mengmeng did the same, and still nothing happened.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao turned up her palm. A stream of black mist rose from that palm, then spread into a small sphere, floating upon it. The black mist that she released was only in the form of a small sphere, but Mengmeng and Qiu Lili both automatically took two steps backward to stay away from it the moment they saw it. As a matter of fact, Mengmeng even hid behind Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t sense the threat from her black mist. Seeing the moves of the two, she asked, “Is it so scary?” After saying that, she took the mist back.</p> <p>“You should try it on a zombie king or queen. You’ll know,” said Qiu Lili. As she said that, both her and Lin Qiao turned to Mengmeng, who was hiding behind her.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>‘No! Don’t hurt me!’</p> <p>Being gazed at by them, Mengmeng even had her fine hair standing straight up. She swiftly drew back and disappeared without leaving a trace.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slightly narrowed her eyes, then saw a sphere of green energy fleetingly move out of the building. She then opened her eyes and said toward Mengmeng, “Alright, I’m going to bring Lili into the space. I’ll leave you here if you keep hiding.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili knew that Mengmeng was able to turn invisible, but didn’t think that Lin Qiao could see the invisible Mengmeng.</p> <p>“Can you see her?” she asked.</p> <p>“Yeah,” Lin Qiao nodded.</p> <p>Mengmeng didn’t come back immediately, but squatted on the roof of another building while looking at Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was too lazy to tell her again to come back. She had only made a joke… How could Mengmeng run so far away because of that?</p> <p>“Are Yuan Tianxing and the others in the base now?” she asked Qiu Lili.</p> <p>“Yeah, I watched them in,” Qiu Lili nodded and said.</p>",
  "Chapter 309: Entering the Base": "<p>After confirming that Yuan Tianxing and the others had returned, Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Great! I’ll bring you into the space. Come on!”</p> <p>She held Qiu Lili’s hands and entered the space with her, then turned invisible and came back out. After that, she sneakily approached Mengmeng, grabbed her suddenly, and dragged her into the space as well.</p> <p>After bringing Mengmeng and Qiu Lili into her space, she flashed out again and turned invisible before heading toward the base. Soon, she sneaked into the base through the small door at an entrance without letting anyone know.</p> <p>The entrances of the space weren’t always closed. During the daytime, a small door would stay open at each entrance. Those doors would only close at nighttime.</p> <p>Every entrance was actually guarded by a large number of soldiers, including at least three level-five superpowered people.</p> <p>There were four entrances in total, located in the East, South, West and North.</p> <p>Upon each entrance was a tall sentry post. The ones guarding in the sentry posts were all level-four green-powered people, because green-powered people had keen sensations, which allowed them to discover anything unusual around the base timely.</p> <p>No zombie was able to hide from the eyes of level-four green-powered people, unless it was at level-five or above.</p> <p>Level-five and six zombies were all smart enough to not show around human bases randomly. After all, there were plenty of superpowered people in each base, even level-seven ones.</p> <p>So, even though a small door was open at each entrance, high-level zombies didn’t dare to approach the base, as those doors were guarded by so many superpowered people. Back when the base was newly built, and the surrounding ordinary zombies were swept off, quite some high-leveled zombies risked for the living human beings in the base. As a result, they were all killed, with their zombie nuclei dug out.</p> <p>Later on, high-leveled zombies had all learned not to get close to any human base.</p> <p>After entering the base, Lin Qiao followed the scents of Lin Feng and the others to find them.</p> <p>As she arrived, she found that Lin Feng and his people were staying in a building in Region D. The building was surrounded by a large group of soldiers. However, why would so many soldiers guard under a building in a civilian area?</p> <p>She walked through the crowd of soldiers, then went upstairs. As she arrived at Lin Feng’s floor, she found that those soldiers were all here for Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>There were a few suites on this floor. Lin Feng and his people stayed in two suites.</p> <p>A few armed soldiers were guarding before the doors of these two suites, carrying their guns.</p> <p>What was happening?</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t understand the situation. Where did these soldiers come from? What were they guarding here?</p> <p>The doors were closed, so Lin Qiao walked to one door and put her ear against the wall to listen to the sounds in the suite.</p> <p>“Xiaolu… Go and get a glass of water,” Cheng Wangxue’s voice was heard.</p> <p>“Alright,” Lin Xiaolu responded.</p> <p>“The meal is almost ready. I’ve finished the pancakes. Lin Hao, take these to next door,” Mrs. Lin’s voice was heard as well.</p> <p>“Are those soldiers still guarding outside?” said Lin Hao.</p> <p>“I think so. Why does that man think that we stole his daughter? I think he’s looking for Miss. Lu,” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“Who knows! Miss. Lu hasn’t come back yet. No one knows if she stole that little girl,” said Mrs. Lin.</p> <p>“This is his base, and he’s the boss of this place. He surely can make any decision… But, who’s this ‘Lin’ that he mentioned?” said Lin Hao.</p> <p>“According to Chief Wu’s description, that is Miss. Lu. She has a space, and can turn invisible. But, hadn’t she left for an emergency?” Lin Feng’s voice also came from behind the door.</p> <p>“Yuan Tianxing and the others have come back, but where are Miss. Lu and her friends?”</p> <p>On hearing that, Lin Qiao learned that all these soldiers were here under Wu Chengyue’s order.</p> <p>She turned and put her ear to the door of another suite, then heard the voices of Yuan Tianxing, Du Yuanxing, Lu Junjie, and some other people.</p> <p>At that moment, the door of Lin Family’s suite was opened, and Lin Qiao immediately stepped aside.</p> <p>Lin Hao opened the door. The soldiers guarding outside only glanced at him, without making any moves. Lin Hao glanced at them as well, then walked to another suite and knocked on the door.</p> <p>The door was soon opened; it was Lin Yu who opened the door and saw Lin Hao.</p> <p>“Wow, food!” The next second, Lin Yu’s eyes were fixed on the plate in Lin Hao’s hands.</p> <p>Lin Hao handed him the plate and said, “Take it, my Mom made these.”</p> <p>Lin Yu happily took it over and said, “Thank Mrs. Lin for us! She’s always been a great cook! This smells wonderful!”</p> <p>Lin Hao waved a hand at him, then turned and left while Lin Yu carried the plate with one hand and closed the door with another.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Lin Hao, who had walked back into the Lin Family’s suite, then at Lin Yu’s door.</p> <p>She didn’t understand why Wu Chengyue had sent his people to guard in here. Those soldiers didn’t seem to restrict the freedom of Lin Feng and his people.</p> <p>This place was way better than the accommodation of the ordinary people. The suites here weren’t as good as the apartments, but were comfortable enough. The buildings in this area all had elevators, but due to the lack of electricity, they weren’t really working, and the people who lived here had to take the stairs.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pondered for a while, then figured that Wu Chengyue had probably checked the entry list that day and saw the names of Lin Feng and the others. That should be why he suspected them.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue had guessed it right though. Lin Qiao just didn’t expect that it would take over three days for Viney and her to help Wu Yueling with the awakening of her power.</p> <p>As it had been three says, she guessed that Wu Chengyue was already driven crazy.</p> <p>At this moment, she suddenly sensed that someone was coming upstairs. She recognized that person by his scent as Wu Chengyue’s right-hand man.</p> <p>Soon, she saw Xiao Yunlong come up with a few subordinates, going toward the Lin Family’s suite.</p> <p>“Deputy Chief!” As Xiao Yunlong walked over, the few soldiers by the door immediately stood at attention and greeted him. Xiao Yunlong nodded at them, then walked up to the door and knocked on it.</p> <p>Lin Hao quickly opened the door. He was holding a piece of pancake, and the other half of it was in his mouth.</p> <p>Upon seeing Xiao Yunlong, he paused slightly.</p> <p>“Hi! Our Chief wants to invite Mr. Lin to his place. I wonder if that’s convenient for him,” Xiao Yunlong stood at the door and lowered his head to look at Lin Hao while saying with a smile.</p> <p>Hearing his words, Lin Hao turned back to shout at the living room, “Brother, Chief Wu wants to see you in his place.”</p> <p>The people in the suite who were preparing to eat all paused and turned to look at the door.</p> <p>Lin Feng stood up from the couch and said to Mrs. Lin and the others, “Mom, you guys eat first. I’ll go to Chief Wu’s place.”</p> <p>While speaking, he walked toward the door.</p> <p>“Please wait for a second,” As Lin Feng walked out, Xiao Yunlong said to him. Then, he turned to knock Yuan Tianxing’s door.</p> <p>Lin Feng silently watched the door open. Then, Yuan Tianxing was invited as well. After that, both of them were guided downstairs.</p>",
  "Chapter 310: Is What You Said Real?": "<p>Lin Qiao silently followed behind them and saw them go downstairs and get into the car which was parked before the building. Xiao Yunlong sent Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing into the backseat, then sat into the front seat himself. After that, the car was driven toward the middle area of the base.</p> <p>Lin Qiao leaped up and gently landed on the car roof.</p> <p>“I wonder if Chief Wu sent you here to find us because you guys have heard something from Ling Ling?” Yuan Tianxing, who was relatively familiar with Xiao Yunlong, started a conversation.</p> <p>“Not yet,” Xiao Yunlong responded, “Actually, we just want to have a meal together with you two. It has been three days, but we don’t how Ling Ling has been doing. Ah, I hope nothing bad is happening to her.”</p> <p>Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing glanced at each other. “Who took Ling Ling away?” asked Lin Feng, “Haven’t Chief Wu found anything yet?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong glanced back at him and said, “We did find some clues. But, the problem is that we can’t find that person, not even a trace of hers.”</p> <p>“If that person you mentioned is really the one we know, Ling Ling will certainly be fine,” said Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>“Can I ask you… was there something wrong with Ling Ling before she was missing?” asked Lin Feng.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t seem to worry about what the person who took his daughter away would do to her, but instead, he appeared to be afraid that something might go wrong with her daughter herself. Lin Feng always felt strange about that.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and Xiao Yunlong made an eye-contact. They hadn’t told anything that Ling Ling’s power awakening, so Lin Feng didn’t know about it.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong glanced at Yuan Tianxing again, then said to Lin Feng, “Days ago, Ling Ling’s power started waking up. She drank some special water that Mr. Yuan gave us, which temporarily stopped her power from waking up. But that day, after you arrived, Ling Ling went missing. There was a note left in her room though…”</p> <p>“Note?” Lin Feng asked with surprise, “What note?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing also looked at Xiao Yunlong confusedly, as he hadn’t heard about the note either.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong took out his phone and showed the two of them a picture of the note.</p> <p>All the satellites were dead after the apocalypse, so signals had ceased to exist in the world. For this reason, cellphones had lost their communication functions.</p> <p>However, people could still play some offline games with their phones, and watch the movies which had been downloaded. Apart from those, a lot of other functions that came with the cellphones were still useful.</p> <p>For example, many cellphones could serve as cameras.</p> <p>“Can you recognize her handwriting,” Xiao Yunlong asked after showing the two the picture.</p> <p>Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing leaned their heads forward to look at the picture, then found the handwriting on the screen to be very familiar.</p> <p>“Was it really her?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong immediately turned back as he stared at them and asked, “Are you sure? Is she with you?”</p> <p>“If you had shown me this earlier, you wouldn’t need to try finding anything out. It’s her indeed,” said Lin Feng.</p> <p>“Who is she?” asked Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing glanced at Lin Feng, then turned to say to Xiao Yunlong, “She’s not a human.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong puzzled at first, looking at the two confusedly. Then, he suddenly recalled the young female zombie with long twin-tails who showed up before their cars three days ago.</p> <p>He slightly widened his eyes and looked at Yuan Tianxing with surprise.</p> <p>“No way… Are you saying that she’s… that too?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing glanced at the driver and stayed silent. Meanwhile, Lin Feng looked at the two of them with confusion.</p> <p>“He has met Qiu Lili,” Yuan Tianxing said to him. Hearing that, Lin Feng immediately understood. “I see,” he nodded and responded.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Feng’s reaction, Xiao Yunlong instantly figured out that Lin Feng knew it all as well.</p> <p>“You… Wait a minute! You and those… eh… What’s your relationship with them? Also, you brought them into our base…”</p> <p>“No one can stop them if they want to come in,” said Lin Feng, “Even the three leaders of your base won’t be able to find her, not even by joining hands. Besides, they’re not bad.”</p> <p>After saying that, he and Yuan Tianxing knowingly glanced at each other.</p> <p>Since it was Lin Qiao who took Ling Ling away, and the problem was about the awakening of her superpower, the little girl would definitely be fine.</p> <p>“Ugh! Didn’t you say that Ling Ling’s power was waking up? In that case, you don’t need to worry. That lady truly knows how to solve that problem,” said Lin Feng abruptly.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong now had many tangled thoughts in his head. Hearing Lin Feng’s words, he asked bewilderedly, “What do you mean?”</p> <p>“If it’s about her power waking up, I think that lady’ll help her get through it safely,” said Lin Feng. Hearing that, Yuan Tianxing and Xiao Yunlong both looked at him with a confused look.</p> <p>“You know my daughter?” said Lin Feng, “In fact, her power woke up as well not long ago.” As he said that, the other two gazed at him with their mouths gaping. Yuan Tianxing then said with disbelief, “Is that real? Why didn’t I know about that?</p> <p>“I asked the others to not tell anyone about it, so you didn’t know,” said Lin Feng.</p> <p>The expression on Xiao Yunlong’s face turned from astonished to shocked, then to delightfully surprised, also mixed with disbelief as he gazed at Lin Feng.</p> <p>“Is what you said real? Is your daughter’s power really awake?”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and said, “Deputy Chief Yuan, I hope that you can keep it a secret. That lady helped my daughter… Only she can do that. So, if she took Ling Ling away and left you a note saying that she was going to help, I can promise that she really is trying to help.”</p> <p>As Lin Feng sounded so sure, Xiao Yunlong happily turned around and said, “Great! So, I can finally stop worrying. But ugh, who is this lady that you’re talking about?”</p> <p>While speaking, he turned back to look at the two. Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing glanced at each other, then said in one voice, “You’ll find out.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong looked at them confusedly.</p> <p>About ten minutes later, the car drove into Special Region A, then to Wu Chengyue’s place. As they got off the car, Xiao Licheng was already seen waiting for them by the gate.</p> <p>“The meal is ready. We’re expecting you guys,” he walked up with a smile.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong quickly brought Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing in, heading straight to the dining room.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was serving the dishes with his sleeves rolled up while Meng Yue was busying in the kitchen.</p> <p>“Welcome, you two! You came at the perfect time. This is our last dish. Please have a seat,” Wu Chengyue placed a large bowl of soup on the table and said. Then, he and Xiao Yunlong each grabbed a seat for Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing made eye-contact, then sat down and said politely, “Thank you!”</p> <p>“Make yourselves at home,” Wu Chengyue smiled and responded, “I had said that we’re going to invite you for a meal earlier. I was just too busy these days.” After saying that, he sat down in the host’s seat. At the same time, Xiao Yunlong grabbed another chair and sat beside him, then glanced at the kitchen.</p>",
  "Chapter 311: Are You Talking About Me?": "<p>None of the four discovered that Lin Qiao had quietly walked to the table, bent over, and sniffed at the dishes. She sensed no scent from those cooked foods.</p> <p>“Chief Wu, you didn’t invite us here to just have a meal, did you?” said Yuan Tianxing. Meanwhile, Xiao Yunlong picked up his bowl and started filling it with soup.</p> <p>Hearing Yuan Tianxing’s words, Wu Chengyue responded while Xiao Yunlong served the soup to the guests, “I do have some questions to ask you. But, we can talk while eating. Here, have some soup first! It won’t taste good once it’s cold.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and Lin Feng each took a sip of the soup. “The soup is nice,” Lin Feng commented.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wanted to get some useful information from them, but as they had started eating, she didn’t think that would happen soon. So, she turned and entered the space, only to see that Wu Yueling was put on a bed by Liu Jun.</p> <p>She was still asleep, lying flat, covered by a blanket.</p> <p>Tong Tong was lying asleep on a couch, probably because he was tired.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the bed and touched Wu Yueling’s hair, finding that they were already dry. She guessed that it was Xie Dong who dried the little girl’s hair.</p> <p>Xie Dong had been having a weak sense of presence. In fact, he was in the space the whole time. Earlier when Lin Qiao stripped herself, he silently ran into the woods.</p> <p>Lin Qiao scooped up the little one. Seeing her move, Liu Jun asked, “Are you going out?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded.</p> <p>At this moment, Wu Chengyue and his guests were eating lukewarmly. Wu Chengyue didn’t start a conversation. Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing stayed silent for a while, and couldn’t help but break the ice. If they didn’t do it, they would feel uneasy during the whole meal.</p> <p>“Chief Wu, we’ll start talking if you don’t. Earlier on, Deputy Chief has already shown us the note. We did recognize that handwriting,” Lin Feng said.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s hand paused above a dish. He turned to glance at Xiao Yunlong and saw the latter nod.</p> <p>“Is she with you? I’ve checked the entry records, but didn’t find her name,” Wu Chengyue turned to Lin Feng and said with confusion. He had checked all the name lists of suspicious people and found each one of them. However, the name of that woman never showed up. Didn’t she register while entering the base?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue thought for a moment, then recalled that Lin Qiao was able to turn herself invisible. Well, if she came in invisibly, she didn’t need to register.</p> <p>However, being invisible didn’t mean that she had disappeared into thin air. She should still have been detected by all sorts of facilities in the entrance. Her body temperature, heartbeat, and breath could all be grasped by the detectors.</p> <p>How did she get in then? Did she climb over the fence wall which was seven or eight meters tall?</p> <p>“You can say that she’s with us,” said Yuan Tianxing, “But, she’s invisible. Usually, she just mysteriously appears in the places she wants to be in, and disappear when she wants to leave.”</p> <p>The faint smile on Wu Chengyue’s face faded when he said worriedly, “But, why did she steal my daughter? Does she really know how to help Ling Ling get through this?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing turned to Lin Feng.</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at him, then said to Wu Chengyue, “She does. My daughter, Lin Xiaolu, had triggered her power not long ago. That lady helped my daughter do it successfully. I only saw her do that once, and I don’t know if Ling Ling is going through the same situation as my daughter was. But, believing in hope is always better than being disappointed.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at him with surprise while saying, “Wait a minute! Did you say that your daughter’s power has woken up as well? Is that real?”</p> <p>He surely knew that Lin Feng’s daughter, Lin Xiaolu, was a seven-year-old little girl, only two years older than Ling Ling.</p> <p>Why did she trigger her power at such a young age?</p> <p>As far as he knew, Ling Ling was the second kid who had triggered a superpower. What was going on? Why had their powers started waking up when they were so young?</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu nodded and said, “I can’t tell the exact reason. We noticed it when Xiaolu’s power just began to wake up, and then, the one who left you this note helped her to get through it.”</p> <p>“So, you can stop worrying now,” Yuan Tianxing said to Wu Chengyue. “She’s confident about it, or she wouldn’t take Ling Ling away.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue calmed himself down, then couldn’t help but ask out of curiosity, “That person you’re talking about, who is she?”</p> <p>At that point, Lin Feng looked at him with a strange expression and said, “In fact, you know her already. Last time, didn’t you ask us if we had seen a short-haired woman with a hat and sunglasses? That’s her. It’s just that the name you told us isn’t the name we know. That’s why we weren’t sure if you were talking about her.”</p> <p>“Isn’t her name Lin? She told me that herself. You’ve seen the note. Isn’t that her signature?” asked Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Thinking about the name ‘Lin’ on the note, both Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing had a strange feeling.</p> <p>“Are you talking about me?” Suddenly, a dry voice joined the conversation. Everyone on the scene paused for a second, then turned to the source of the voice. They saw a woman standing about three meters from them, carrying a child. She was wearing a hat and a pair of sunglasses, so they couldn’t see her face clearly.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue immediately stood up. Because of his movement, his chair was sent backward and caused a noise.</p> <p>“Ling Ling!” He recognized his precious little girl at a glance.</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue seemed to charge at her, Lin Qiao immediately made two steps backward and said, “Eh, wait, wait, let’s make this clear fist. I am now returning your daughter to you, and she’s perfectly healthy now. She’s just asleep. In one or two hours, she’ll wake up. If you dare to attack me again, I’ll come back and take her away again!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue paused upon hearing her words. Her speech sounded normal at first, but why did she then start to threaten him?</p> <p>“Eh? When did you come back? How’s Ling Ling?”</p> <p>“Yeah, how’s the little Ling Ling?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and Lin Feng hurriedly stood up to speak to Lin Qiao with surprise, and also to ease the tense situation.</p> <p>“I never left. I was outside the base.” While speaking, Lin Qiao slowly moved toward Wu Chengyue and handed him the child. Meanwhile, she had also been preparing for a sudden lightning bolt that might be landing on her head.</p> <p>He had done that before after all!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue hurriedly took over the child and touched her forehead and neck. He felt her pulse and body temperature back to normal. At the moment, her chest was heaving slightly.</p> <p>Knowing that his daughter was fine, Wu Chengyue finally felt relieved.</p> <p>Then, he noticed that Lin Qiao hadn’t answered the questions yet.</p> <p>“How is Ling Ling’s current condition?” He raised his head to look at Lin Qiao and asked. The latter rolled her eyes and responded, “You’ll know when she wakes up.”</p> <p>After saying that, she disappeared from where she was.</p> <p>At that point, Meng Yue walked to Wu Chengyue and held Wu Yueling’s hands while focusing her sensations on her. She found that Wu Yueling was healthy indeed.</p> <p>“It seems that Ling Ling really is fine,” she looked at Wu Chengyue and said, a clear relief reflecting in her voice.</p>",
  "Chapter 312: What is She Looking For?": "<p>At that moment, Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing glanced at each other. “Why do I feel that Miss. Lu has been here for long?” Lin Feng asked.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “When did she come back?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was carrying Ling Ling to the living room. Hearing their conversation, he stopped, then turned back and asked, “Is her last name Lu?”</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded and responded, “Yeah, her name is Lu…”</p> <p>Abruptly and weirdly, Yuan Tianxing interrupted him and said, “Ah, that’s right! Her last name is Lu. That is correct!”</p> <p>Lin Feng looked at him confusedly. He had known Yuan Tianxing for long, so he understood that there must be some reasons why the latter interrupted him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave Yuan Tianxing a suspicious glance and saw the latter wearing a smiling face, as if he said what he said unintentionally.</p> <p>At that moment, Ling Ling slightly moved her eyelids, then slowly opened her eyes.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t see that as he was looking at Yuan Tianxing. However, Meng Yue, who was beside him, noticed that.</p> <p>“Look, Ling Ling is awake!”</p> <p>The others immediately turned their eyes to the kid carried in Wu Chengyue’s arms.</p> <p>As Meng Yue had said, Wu Chengyue had opened her eyes, and was confusedly looking around. As all the others looked at her, she immediately turned her head around and buried her face in Wu Chengyue’s arms.</p> <p>“Ling Ling? Ling Ling! Here, look at Daddy. Tell Daddy, is there any discomfort?” Wu Chengyue looked at her and spoke with a delightful surprise. Meanwhile, he hurriedly put her on a couch.</p> <p>Wu Yueling sneakily raised one sparkling eye to look at him, then hid her face back in his arms.</p> <p>As his daughter seemed to be clear-minded and reacted normally, Wu Chengyue finally gave a long sigh of relief.</p> <p>At that point, Wu Yueling suddenly began groping around her own body with her tiny hands, but failed to find anything. After that, she abruptly sat up from Wu Chengyue’s arms on his lap, then lowered her head to look at the clothes that she was wearing confusedly.</p> <p>‘Eh? These aren’t my clothes… They are so large…’</p> <p>But soon, she forgot about the clothes. She searched around her but didn’t find her treasure, so she began looking around Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>She still didn’t see it.</p> <p>As she failed to find her treasure in the living room, Wu Chengyue curved her lips downward, then raised her face to look at Wu Chengyue in the eyes tearfully.</p> <p>“What is she looking for?” Lin Feng knew about children. After all, he had a daughter too.</p> <p>“She should be looking for her grass dragonfly,” Wu Chengyue thought for a moment and said, then saw Wu Yueling nod heavily.</p> <p>“Don’t worry, your treasure is in your room,” Wu Chengyue smiled and said, “Are you hungry? Shall we go upstairs to change clothes, then come back down to eat?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Yueling nodded quickly and happily, as she would be able to see her grass dragonfly back in her room.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue affectionately put a hand on her hair. Stroking his daughter’s smooth hair, he felt that his heart was filled with something.</p> <p>“I’ll take Ling Ling upstairs to change. Yunlong, please invite Mr. Lin and Mr. Yuan back to the dining table.”</p> <p>Seeing Wu Chengyue stand up with Wu Yueling carried in his arms, Xiao Yunlong finally recovered from the shock and nodded.</p> <p>“Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, please come back and have a seat. We haven’t finished our meal yet.” After saying this, Xiao Yunlong pointed a hand at the table.</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue had been sent back to her father perfectly unharmed, Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing were relieved as well. They smiled while walking toward the dining table after hearing Yuan Tianxing’s words.</p> <p>“Ugh, why did Miss. Lu leave so soon?” Yuan Tianxing asked curiously.</p> <p>“Are you sure that she has left?” Lin Feng glanced at him with a weird look.</p> <p>At that moment, Xiao Yunlong joined the conversation, “Yeah, that Miss. Lu has really managed to wake Ling Ling up. Also, has the little Ling Ling truly triggered a superpower?”</p> <p>“About that, you need to ask Ling Ling herself,” said Lin Feng, “Maybe, we can also ask Miss. Lu when we get back.”</p> <p>“I think Chief Wu needs to strengthen the guards of his place! Is it appropriate to let her just come and go whenever she wants?” Yuan Tianxing said.</p> <p>Hearing that, Meng Yue, who had silently followed them to the dining table, responded, “If even Chengyue and I can’t discover her, there would be no use of adding more guards.”</p> <p>The three men paused slightly. Recalling how that lady showed up silently beside them without being noticed by anyone on the scene, they felt that Meng Yue was right.</p> <p>“If someone had sent her to do intelligence works or assassinations, who would be able to stop her except for the super powerful ones?”</p> <p>When the few people were guessing about the success rate of an assassinate mission carried by Lin Qiao, Wu Chengyue carried Ling Ling upstairs.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, do you remember anything?” Wu Chengyue went up to the third floor and asked his daughter while heading toward her room. Wu Yueling sat in his arms, looking at him with confusion. Judging by the look on her face, Wu Chengyue figured that she didn’t remember anything.</p> <p>He opened the door of Wu Yueling’s room and walked in, then put her on the bed. After that, he turned to find her clothes in the closet.</p> <p>Wu Yueling turned and crawled to the nightstand once she was put on the bed. A yellow-green grass dragonfly was placed there.</p> <p>She reached out her little hands to pick up the dragonfly, then grinned happily.</p> <p>Upon returning with clean clothes, Wu Chengyue saw his daughter sitting on the bed while holding the grass dragonfly with both hands. Her cute little face was wearing a bright smile.</p> <p>He hadn’t seen his daughter showing such a sweet grin for a long time. His heart was even melted by that grin. Holding the clothes, he couldn’t bear walking over to interrupt her.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao entered her space. Before she walked to the furniture area where Liu Jun was staying, she suddenly felt that one of her feet was heavy, and that something was pulling her trouser leg.</p> <p>“Eh?” She lowered her head to find a large sphere of gray fur curling on her foot, biting her trouser leg.</p> <p>‘Ah, it’s the gray rabbit.’</p> <p>As Lin Qiao lowered her head to look at it, the rabbit immediately relaxed its bite, then jumped off her foot and hopped around her feet.</p> <p>“What are you doing?” Lin Qiao looked at the rabbit bewilderedly, as she didn’t know what it wanted. She was able to read the minds of some zombies and people, but couldn’t hear the thoughts of animals…</p> <p>At that moment, a little person excitedly rushed at the rabbit.</p> <p>Liu Jun found that it was Tong Tong. And then, she saw Liu Jun follow behind him.</p> <p>The rabbit was probably startled by the running Tong Tong. It turned a little anxious, then suddenly bit Lin Qiao’s trouser leg again and tried to drag her to the side. This time, it was doing it many times harder than before.</p> <p>“Does it want you to bring it out? It was with that little girl the whole time. Once you left, it began running about. I don’t know what he was doing.”</p>",
  "Chapter 313: Where is the Rabbit From": "<p>Lin Qiao glanced at the fluffy gray rabbit, then raised her head to look at Liu Jun and say to her, “That can’t be true, can it?”</p> <p>Liu Jun shrugged and replied, “I’m just guessing.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the rabbit again, then picked it up.</p> <p>At that point, Tong Tong came to her side and raised his head to look at her while saying, “I want to hold the rabbit.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him, then bent over and put the rabbit in his arms. However, the rabbit didn’t seem to like him, as it started struggling once it was put in his arms. Tong Tong couldn’t hold it tight, so he soon let it jump out of his arms.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment, then closed her eyes to look outside. After that, she flashed out.</p> <p>She turned invisible and stood between Wu Chengyue’s living room and dining room, which was exactly where she had returned Ling Ling to Wu Chengyue. She sniffed at the air and found that Wu Chengyue and the little one were both upstairs. So, she turned and walked to the stairs, then glanced back at the people who were having a meal in the dining room.</p> <p>Next, she re-entered her space, picked up the rabbit which was being chased around by Tong Tong, and flashed back out.</p> <p>She put the gray ball of fur on the stairs, then turned and left Wu Chengyue’s place, heading to where Lin Feng and the others stayed.</p> <p>After he got Wu Yueling dressed, Wu Chengyue saw the large fluffy ball on the stairs while carrying his daughter down.</p> <p>“Eh? What is this…”</p> <p>Hearing Wu Chengyue’s voice, Wu Yueling turned back and took a look. She paused slightly at first, but then quickly recognized the rabbit. After that, she reached her hands out and leaned toward the rabbit.</p> <p>Her face wasn’t showing any expression, but her reaction and sparkling eyes were telling Wu Chengyue that she wanted that ball of fur.</p> <p>“Do you know what it is?”</p> <p>Once Wu Chengyue said that, that ball of fur moved slightly, then turned around, looking at Wu Yueling with long lopped ears.</p> <p>“Ugh, isn’t this the rabbit that we saw the last time? Eh, why is it a little like that female zombie’s rabbit?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave it a closer look and recognized it as a rabbit, a familiar one. That was just that rabbit which Ling Ling had in her arms when she came out of that female zombie’s space back in Hangzhou.</p> <p>Back then, Wu Chengyue didn’t pay much attention to the rabbit and only gave it a quick glance, as he was focusing on his daughter. But now, he looked at it carefully and felt that it seemed very much like the rabbit which belonged to the female zombie who had suffered a thunder strike of hers.</p> <p>While speaking, he put Wu Yueling down, who rushed at that ball of fur once she got on her feet. At the same time, the rabbit even hopped toward her.</p> <p>She happily scooped up the rabbit, then followed Wu Chengyue downstairs.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, you won’t be able to eat while holding it. Why don’t you put it on the chair next to you?” As Wu Chengyue sat on a chair, everyone else curiously looked at the rabbit in her arms. Wu Chengyue put an empty chair beside her while talking to her.</p> <p>“Eh? Isn’t this the rabbit in Miss. Lu’s space? Why is it here?” said Lin Feng with surprise.</p> <p>After watching his daughter obediently put the rabbit on the empty chair, Wu Chengyue said, “Eh, we saw it just now on the stairs when we were getting down. It’s her rabbit, isn’t it? Why did she leave it for Ling Ling then? Ling Ling seems to like the rabbit very much though.”</p> <p>“I’ve seen this rabbit in her space,” said Lin Feng, “I think it was living quite a life in there.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue sat beside Wu Yueling, then took over her small bowl from Meng Yue’s hands, and put some food into it for her to eat.</p> <p>Wu Yueling fed herself with a fork and a pair of chopsticks while looking at the rabbit.</p> <p>“I have one question that only came to me after I saw this rabbit. Meng Yue, have you seen this rabbit before?” said Wu Chengyue abruptly. Afterward, he turned to look at Meng Yue, who was sitting in front of the rabbit.</p> <p>Meng Yue spent a while staring at the rabbit with a frown, then replied, “Have I ever seen it? I don’t remember.”</p> <p>“Two months ago,” Wu Chengyue reminded her, “Ling Ling was kidnapped by that woman. We found her in a farm, inside an orchard. Back then, Ling Ling came out with a rabbit in her arms. The rabbit was smaller at that time. Think about it.”</p> <p>Hearing his words, Meng Yue was puzzled at first, then had her eyes glowed. She nodded and responded, “Ah, yes! There was with a rabbit back then, and Ling Ling was reluctant to part with it.”</p> <p>After saying that, she started observing that fluffy gray rabbit.</p> <p>“It does look a little like that rabbit.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned to Yuan Tianxing and the other two, who were both confused at that moment, then asked Lin Feng, “May I ask you something? That lady we saw just now, she isn’t human, is she?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing, Lin Feng, Xiao Yunlong, and Meng Yue were all stunned.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and the other two knew about the truth, but Meng Yue wasn’t prepared for that. So, she gazed at Wu Chengyue in shock.</p> <p>She was also thinking about that female zombie, but didn’t think that Wu Chengyue would say it out loud right in front of the two guests.</p> <p>Seeing the surprised look on the faces of Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing, Wu Chengyue gave a faint smile and said, “No wonder she has been wearing those sunglasses, and her voice is hoarse and dry. Back then, I felt that she wasn’t like a zombie at all except for her appearance. And now, I’m surprised to find that she’s actually able to talk. It has only been two months, but she evolved so quickly.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Yuan Tianxing and Lin Feng were surprised as well, “Eh? Have you met before?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong recalled that female zombie as well. “Where are her hair?” he asked abruptly, “Did she cut her hair? Ah, I know, she cut her hair because you turned her hair into an afro, which was quite ugly.”</p> <p>Hearing what Xiao Yunlong said, Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing immediately turned to Wu Chengyue with a weird look, then glanced at each other. From each other’s eyes, they learned that they were now sharing the same opinion.</p> <p><em>‘There’s a story!’</em></p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at them with curiosity and said smilingly, “So it is her. I didn’t think that she would be with you. Aren’t you afraid?”</p> <p>Lin Feng shook his head and said, “We were a little frightened at first indeed, but she saved all of us. It is really weird when a zombie saves your life, but we gradually were no longer afraid of her.”</p> <p>“She doesn’t scare us because we believe that she won’t hurt us. She’s powerful though. I guess that except for you, no one in this room is a match for her,” Yuan Tianxing nodded and said. Then, he glanced at Wu Chengyue, implying that he should have a chance of winning against Lin Qiao.</p> <p>At that moment, Xiao Yunlong said two words, “He lost…” After saying that, he silently glanced at Wu Chengyue. Without using his power, he failed to take off that female zombie’s hat. On the contrary, he let her win, and rudely bit her thigh.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue felt that he was despised for some reason…</p> <p>“… What?” Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing didn’t manage to understand Xiao Yunlong’s words immediately.</p>",
  "Chapter 314: Excuses": "<p>After leaving Wu Chengyue’s place, Lin Qiao climbed onto a tree outside, then leaped out. Stepping on utility poles and building roofs, he moved fleetingly toward Lin Feng’s place.</p> <p>She stopped near an administration building in Region D, then jumped down.</p> <p>At this moment in an alley near the building, some people were surrounded.</p> <p>Chen Yuting, a vice-captain of his squad, and a few squad members of his were stuck in the alley by another group of people.</p> <p>The one who barred their road was a deputy chief and his subordinates.</p> <p>This deputy chief was exactly the one who had talked to Tang He earlier, also Yang Chao’s right-hand man. At that moment, he was standing in a clean spot, leaning against the wall and smoking. He was wearing a pair of sunglasses, and wasn’t looking at Chen Yuting and his people.</p> <p>Chen Yuting and his people were staring at him, their faces showing anger, resentment, and fear.</p> <p>“Lu Ting was killed by zombies,” he said, “I had said that you shouldn’t have let that woman follow the squad out of the base. Now she’s dead, but what made you think that you can blame us for not keeping her safe? Besides, people should be responsible for their own safety outside the base. She has died, but what can we do about it? If you didn’t want her to die, you shouldn’t have let her go out of the base.”</p> <p>The deputy chief’s name was Piao Gechang. He faced Chen Yuting and his people sideways as he put the cigarette between his lips and took a deep inhalation, then let out the smoke from his nostrils.</p> <p>“I don’t need so many excuses,” he said blandly. “You should be aware that she was a space-powered person, and how rare space-powered people are. Why did she and her brother both die? He was a level-six water-powered man. How could he not even have a chance to run if you didn’t encounter a level-six or seven zombie?”</p> <p>While speaking, he put the cigarette back between his lips and took another inhalation, then let out the smoke.</p> <p>“You think level-six or seven zombies are so easy to find? Do you think that we’re idiots? If you had really run into a zombie king or queen, how could the rest of you survive? How can you still stand here and talk to me like this? You wouldn’t even have had a chance of coming back to the base if that were real.”</p> <p>“No… That’s not true! There were also robbers! Strong post-apocalyptic robbers!” As Piao Gecang refused to believe them, the vice-captain behind Chen Yuting said anxiously.</p> <p>Piao Gecang paused slightly, then abruptly turned to say to them with a grin, “Eh? You met robbers? Then tell me, who are they? What levels they’re at?”</p> <p>Chen Yuting stared at him and said certainly, “Yes, we met robbers. They kidnaped Lu Ting and two young men from our squad. They brought our people toward Hangzhou, and we chased them. When we finally caught up with them, they were already killed by zombies.”</p> <p>The people around Chen Yuting all nodded to try and make his words sound more credible.</p> <p>“Yes, that’s right!”</p> <p>“When we got in, those robbers were all dead. But, I think their leader had escaped. Lu Ting was killed there!”</p> <p>“No matter how, you’ve let her die. I had told you that you can’t let her die. Since you said that she was killed by zombies, I’ll believe you. I won’t kill you, as we aren’t allowed to kill inside the base. I’ll just take an arm from each of you.” Finishing talking, Piao Gecang put the cigarette back between his lips to take his last inhalation, then flicked the butt away.</p> <p>Once he said that, his people began approaching Chen Yuting and his squad members.</p> <p>As seven or eight superpowered people who were at level four or five walked toward them, Chen Yuting and his people panicked, immediately making defensive postures.</p> <p>Among them, one was at level-six, one level-five, and the rest were all at level-three. Chen Yuting had a chance against Piao Gecang, but his squad members were no matches for Piao Gecang’s subordinates.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Chen Yuting confusedly. She killed Lu Ting and her brother, but why did Chen Yuting lie about it?</p> <p>Also, the man with sunglasses actually claimed their arms as if there was no one to rule him in this base. He seemed to be in quite a high position in the base. Also, he was a level-six superpowered man.</p> <p>“Deputy Chief Piao, I will fight you if you insist! But, if you are using Lu Ting’s death as an excuse, I won’t accept it!”</p> <p>Piao Gecang sneered and said, “You might be right, but so what? Lu Ting was my woman after all. I wasn’t tired of her yet, but you got her killed. Can you get me another woman who’s as pretty as she was?”</p> <p>After saying that, he suddenly swung an arm. Following his move, a streak of fire burst out from above Chen Yuting and his people’ heads, then quickly expanded and descended. The high temperature of the fire made Chen Yuting and his people feel their hair get burned.</p> <p>Chen Yuting reacted swiftly. He raised an arm, and along with his movement, the mixture of cement and earth came out of the walls nearby and shielded them against the fire.</p> <p>The fire landed on the layer of mixture but didn’t disappear. Instead, it moved downward through the gaps between the mixture and the walls.</p> <p>Piao Gecang’s people didn’t join the fight, but stood aside and watched.</p> <p>The air temperature turned high as the fire came down, as if the air itself was set on fire. The few lower-leveled members on Chen Yuting’s side instantly felt hard to breathe, like they were getting suffocated.</p> <p>They were surrounded by walls. Before they could find a way out, they started feeling dizzy because of oxygen deficiency.</p> <p>The attack from a level-six superpower man wasn’t something that these level-three people could survive.</p> <p>Piao Gecang’s fire didn’t only have a high temperature, but was also poisonous. Therefore, even though Chen Yuting managed to protect his people and himself from the actual fire timely with his earth power, the toxins contained in the fire still spread in the air.</p> <p>As Chen Yuting raised both arms, the cement ground split. A wall rose from the ground, quickly blocking the gaps between the mixture and the wall and stopping the fire from coming closer to his people and himself.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the earth under their feet began sinking. As the ground sank two meters deep, he created a tunnel underground.</p> <p>“Go into the tunnel… Hurry up!”</p> <p>The vice-captain, who was doing better than the others, immediately helped the weakest squad member up from the ground, then walked into the tunnel. The other two squad members struggled up and moved into the tunnel as well while holding the wall.</p> <p>“You think you can leave by getting underground?” said Piao Gecang coldly. “Release the snakes,” He then turned to one of his men and continued.</p> <p>Next, one of his men suddenly leaped up and threw a heavy kick at Chen Yuting’s earth wall.</p> <p>Bang! He easily created a hole on the earth wall, which was over ten-centimeters thick.</p> <p>After that, another man waved a hand and released a finger-thick snake. When landing on the ground, the snake quickly split into countless snakes, all crawling toward the tunnel.</p> <p>At the same time, these snakes were growing larger and splitting again.</p>",
  "Chapter 315: You Play First": "<p>Chen Yuting soon fixed the hole that Piao Gecang had created, after which, his skin quickly became like the surface of stones in the darkness. Meanwhile, more stone walls rose from the ground to block the other exit of the tunnel.</p> <p>The black snakes that were released by one of Piao Gecang’s men were instantly trapped around Chen Yuting.</p> <p>Chen Yuting was a level-six powerful being, so Piao Gecang couldn’t do any harm to him within a short while. To protect the others, Chen Yuting was fighting alone. But, Piao Gecang guessed that he would sneak underground and leave before long as well.</p> <p>Anyway, Piao Gecang didn’t seem to care about that either. He abruptly raised a hand to take back his fire and said, “Chen Yuting, you might be able to run this time, but I’m telling you… you will come back to me. By then, you’ll need to break your arm off yourself and send it to me.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, he turned around and waved at his people. After that, they left the alley together.</p> <p>Seeing the confident look on Piao Gecang’s face, Lin Qiao, who was standing on the wall, felt that there must be something else that he didn’t mention, or he wouldn’t have said that.</p> <p>She then glanced at where Chen Yuting was, and saw the earth walls around him slowly sink, exposing a statue-like man. She gave a closer look at the statue’s face and found that it was none other than Chen Yuting himself.</p> <p>Soon, Chen Yutings stone-like skin turned back to normal. Afterward, the earth not far away suddenly split up, and the vice-captain and three members of the Feng Ting Squad rose from the underground.</p> <p>The vice-captain was the only clear-minded one while the others were all lying on the ground in a coma.</p> <p>“Captain, they’re poisoned by the fire!” The vice-captain said to Chen Yuting anxiously. The latter immediately ran to his people, and he and the vice-captain helped the three up from the ground.</p> <p>“We’ll get them to the hospital first,” he said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at them and thought for a moment, then turned and left.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Half an hour later, Piao Gecang and his people arrived at a place in Region F which was similar to a refugee zone. The houses in this area were all old and shabby, one or two-story. Even the doors and windows were broken. Many windows were sealed with planks or battens, to prevent the wind from blowing into the houses.</p> <p>This whole area was very old and crude.</p> <p>Many people lived here. Most of them were wearing ragged or dirty clothes, looking unkempt and sallow.</p> <p>They were all commoners without powers.</p> <p>From the outside, one could see that many houses didn’t have any furniture pieces in them. Only one or two beds were seen, as many people slept on the floor.</p> <p>When Piao Gecang and his people passed through this area, the people who sat by the doors or leaned against the walls saw that they were all wearing clean clothes, armed with guns or rifles. So, these people all quieted down as they silently watched them pass by with their heads held high.</p> <p>The residents in this area could tell that this group of people was from the base center or the middle-class area. They understood that they shouldn’t mess with these people, because once they did, they would die without even knowing how. And after they died, no one would come to investigate their death.</p> <p>After about twenty minutes of walking, Piao Gecang and his people stopped before a small, two-story building.</p> <p>They walked into the building and went upstairs. The stairs were dark and dirty; garbage, stones, and sands piled up on both sides of the stairs, only leaving the narrow middle part clean. And that part was clean only because people had been walking through it.</p> <p>In the corridor on the second floor, they saw three men standing by the door of a room. Seeing Piao Gecang and his people, the three men immediately greeted him with politeness.</p> <p>“Deputy Chief!”</p> <p>Piao Gecang took a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and pulled out one while walking to the door of that room. As he stopped before the door and put the cigarette between his lips, someone beside him quickly lighted the cigarette up for him with a lighter.</p> <p>He took one inhalation, then let out the smoke and asked, “Have you brought her?”</p> <p>The three people who guarded by the door immediately wore a fawning smile while replying, “Yes! We were going to get her in Chen Yuting’s home, but it would be a little difficult. But later on, this woman came out herself. I think she was heading to the market. So, we captured her on her way there. We knocked out her two bodyguards and threw them in somewhere quiet.”</p> <p>Piao Gecang nodded and said, “Alright, open the door. You haven’t touched her yet, have you?”</p> <p>The three men by the door hurriedly shook their heads and waved their hands while saying, “No, no! Deputy Chief, you’ve said that you want to play first. How dare we touch her without your permission? That woman really has great body shape!”</p> <p>While speaking and opening the door, these three men all showed a greedy look in their eyes.</p> <p>Piao Gecang laughed and responded, “Great! Don’t worry, you’ll get to play with her when I’m done! But by then, you should all be careful. Don’t kill her so soon. This woman can keep you company for a long time.”</p> <p>Watching him walk into the room, the others all looked excited. Once in, Piao Gecang closed the door.</p> <p>He had kidnapped someone important for Chen Yuting. Judging by the conversation between him and Chen Yuting, he was going to use this person to hurt Chen Yuting.</p> <p>Lu Ting was probably one of his women, and her life shouldn’t mean a lot to him.</p> <p>The room was dark; it was a single room, without even a toilet. There was just one window, and that too was sealed.</p> <p>The room was empty, with just one bed. On the bed was an old and scruffy blanket, and a woman sitting in a corner, with her limbs tied up and mouth taped.</p> <p>As the door was opened and a strange man walked in, the woman looked at that man with fear, and couldn’t help but move backward.</p> <p>“Hm… Hm! Whoo…” She quickly shook her head, her eyes showing nothing but fear and panic.</p> <p>She had heard what those men said outside the door, and knew what this man was going to do to her.</p> <p>Piao Gecang stood by the door. While smoking, he observed the woman on the bed under the light which came in through the cracks of the window.</p> <p>This woman wasn’t pretty. Her face wasn’t delicate enough, but were well-featured. However, her legs which had curled before her chest were long.</p> <p>Piao Gecang held the cigarette between his lips, then walked to the bedside.</p> <p>“Whoo…” The woman flinched and drew backward out of fear, even wanting to hide into the wall behind her. But soon, the man bent over and grabbed her feet, then violently pulled her toward him.</p> <p>“Whoo…” The woman was so frightened by the hands which had clasped her ankles, but her screams were sealed in her mouth.</p> <p>“Ah, you do have slim ankles. You say, If I squeeze then really hard, will they break?” Piao Gecang said with curiosity after pulling her out.</p> <p>“Hmm… Hm…” The woman struggled as hard as she could. She tried to pull her feet out of Piao Gecang’s hands, but her strength was nothing in Piao Gecang’s eyes.</p> <p>He grabbed the woman’s ankle with one hand and took the cigarette out of his mouth with the other. Then, he suddenly pulled her under his crotch and bent over to let out a cloud of smoke toward her face which was filled with fear and despair.</p>",
  "Chapter 316: Please Let Me Go": "<p>Piao Gecang pulled the woman over and breathed out the smoke upon her face. After that, he threw away the cigarette butt and reached his hand to grasp the woman’s collar before ripping it.</p> <p>“Em… Hmm…”</p> <p>The woman tried her best to struggle. She kicked her legs, which were tied together, like a fish, trying to free herself from that man’s control.</p> <p>However, Piao Gecang just grasped her clothes and pulled them violently. Soon, her clothes were all torn into pieces. The man really enjoyed the feeling of tearing the woman’s clothes.</p> <p>“Hmm…” The despairing woman had her face covered in tears while muffled screams escaped her taped mouth.</p> <p>Piao Gecang heavily grabbed her snow-white breasts. The soft and elastic feeling came from his palm, which was so great that it made him excited.</p> <p>“Hmmm…”</p> <p>Piao Gecang had one hand next to the woman’s neck to support his own body. Seeing the look on her face, he suddenly raised the hand beside the woman’s neck and tore off the tape from her mouth.</p> <p>“Ah! No! No, no, please, please let me go… No…” The woman burst in cries and screams once the tape on her mouth was taken off. While screeching, she struggled as hard as possible to try and get away from this man.</p> <p>Piao Gecang laughed dirtily and said to her, “Scream, just scream! I love raping women the most. Only the women who fight back can bring me pleasure! Hah…”</p> <p>While speaking, he lied heavily upon the woman.</p> <p>“No… Stop! Stop! Help! Help! Someone help me! No…”</p> <p>At that moment, Piao Gecang lowered his head and impatiently blocked the woman’s mouth with his lips, which had a strong, unpleasant smell of cigarette. Meanwhile, both his hands were busy.</p> <p>“No… No…” The woman felt a disgusting stink flowing into her mouth, following which, a slippery tongue broke into her mouth through her teeth.</p> <p>At that moment, the few men outside had pressed their ears against the door to hear the sounds in the room, all looking exciting.</p> <p>“Wow, it is intense! That woman’s screams sound great!”</p> <p>“Listen, her voice is muffled. I bet Deputy Chief couldn’t help but kiss her.”</p> <p>No one noticed the rape which was happening in the room and those people who were eavesdropping outside the door. Even if some people passed by this building and heard the woman’s cries, they wouldn’t get involved in this. Instead, they would pretend to hear nothing and keep walking.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao went to Lin Feng’s accommodation but didn’t take the stairs up. Instead, she climbed up the wall to get in through the window; she did that because the door was guarded!</p> <p>After locating Lin Feng’s window, she quickly climbed up there, then quietly got in through the window. Mrs. Lin and the others were all in the living room, sitting on couches and talking.</p> <p>“Will Lin Feng have a meal in Chief Wu’ place before coming back? It has been nearly half an hour,” said Cheng Wangxue. She was sitting on a couch, with Lin Xiaolu on her knees.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin was leaning against the back of the couch with her arms crossed before her chest. She shook her head and responded, “I think he will. Chief Wu invited Lin Feng at this time, so I guess he must have prepared the meal. I think they’ll talk while eating.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen brushed her long hair while saying, “About what? Miss. Lu?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin nodded and said, “I guess so… or what else can they be talking about? Besides, Chief Wu hasn’t found his daughter yet. Does he have the mood to talk about anything else?”</p> <p>The others nodded in agreement.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao walked to an empty chair and sat down, also nodding. She was still invisible, so of course no one was able to see her.</p> <p>At that point, Lin Wenwen checked her watch and said, “I think it’s time for us to go to the Mission Hall and see if anyone came to apply for the job today.” While speaking, she stood up.</p> <p>Once she moved, Lin Hao and Long Qingying followed her, all three of them walking toward the door.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin, Cheng Wangxue, Lu Junjie, Xing Le and Wei Jingchen, who were also arranged to stay in this flat, came out as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quickly stood up and followed them. Once she came out, she saw that Lin Wenwen had gone to knock on the door across the hallway.</p> <p>“It’s time to go to the Mission Hall.”</p> <p>Soon, someone opened the door, then Du Yuanxing and Li Zheng walked out.</p> <p>“We were expecting you,” said Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen turned and walked away without even glancing at the soldiers who were guarding by the door. While walking, she said, “Let’s go. I want to go to the market this afternoon, to see if there’s anything we can trade.”</p> <p>Lin Hao looked at her with confusion and asked, “Again? You went there yesterday and the day before that. We’ve pretty much done all the trades that we should have done, haven’t we?”</p> <p>The market was a place where people could trade for food or other things they needed with their own valuable belongings. Most people went there to trade for food. Of course, one could trade things with zombie nuclei in that place.</p> <p>Some people would set up stalls in the market.</p> <p>These days, Lin Wenwen had dragged Long Qingying to the market three times. So, Lin Hao thought that she had gotten all she needed.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen rolled her eyes and said, “What do you know? It’s like digging for treasures. Maybe I missed something before.”</p> <p>Usually, men wouldn’t understand women’ desire for shopping. So obviously, Lin Hao and the other men on the scene all looked at her confusedly.</p> <p>The group of people then went downstairs. The soldiers guarded by the door didn’t try to stop them, but two of them followed them down.</p> <p>Not long after they left the neighborhood, Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing were sent back by Xiao Yunlong. When leaving, he brought all the soldiers with him.</p> <p>When Lin Wenwen and the others arrived at the Mission Hall, a few people were expecting them in their spot.</p> <p>There was a large LED screen in the hall, showing all the available tasks. Many people also had set up stands in the open space nearby and hung up signs to release tasks or hire people.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and the others walked to their stand and saw a few plainly dressed men standing there stiffly. As they arrived, those people all nervously looked at them, pushing each other. None of them dared to walk up and ask a question.</p> <p>“Hi, are you here to apply for a job? What skills and requirements do you have?” Lin Wenwen smilingly stepped forward and asked. At that point, the man at the front was pushed out by his friends. He turned to glance back at the others in a flurry. As all his friends nodded at him, he turned around to look at Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“We want to know if… if commoners can apply for the job or not,” the man stuttered.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and the others knew that these people were commoners as soon as they arrived. If these men had superpowers, they wouldn’t be so shy, and wouldn’t wear these old dirty clothes while standing here with an unpleasant smell.</p> <p>Around them, the people with powers had all stepped away, intentionally or not.</p>",
  "Chapter 317: Only Deceiving Honest People": "<p>Lin Wenwen didn’t show dislike toward these people, but smiled at them and asked, “Do you have the strength? Can you carry bricks?”</p> <p>Hearing her questions, the few men quickly nodded.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen gave a grin and responded, “As long as you have the strength, superpowers aren’t necessary. However, there’s one thing… you’ll get this job only if you have the courage to come with us. Don’t worry, we won’t try to harm you at least.”</p> <p>Hearing her words, the few men hesitated for a while, then said, “May I ask, do you provide food? We’re not demanding much. We’ll work for you only if you give us one full meal per day!”</p> <p>They had been starved for days, with nothing to eat. They were working on a farm in Special Region C, but half a month ago, they were replaced. Someone pulled the strings to take their jobs, and they became jobless.</p> <p>They were ordinary people, without any superpowers; they weren’t fighters, as they had no knowledge of martial arts. No zombie hunting squad would recruit commoners like them, so even if they risked to go out of the base, they would probably be bitten to death by zombies very soon.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen glanced at the others.</p> <p>Then, Du Yuanxing said, “Ah, that’s for sure! If you have the guts to come with us, you won’t only get one meal per day. You’ll be provided with three meals a day… And if you do your jobs well, we’ll also give you some rice or flour.”</p> <p>The few men slightly widened their eyes as they looked at Du Yuanxing with disbelief, then at Lin Wenwen. “Re-really?” they asked, “Can we really get rice and flour?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded and said, “That is true. But, we can’t tell you where the working place will be yet. You’ll find out when we get there. Now, I’m asking you if you’re brave enough to come with us?”</p> <p>Those men looked at each other, hesitating.</p> <p>At that point, one of those people who had been watching them since long ago chipped in, “You wouldn’t even tell them about the location. Three meals a day? Rice and Flour? Are you sure what you said is real? You don’t believe it yourself, do you?”</p> <p>“Haha, yeah! I’ve been paying attention to this mission for long. Your offer seems to be tempting, but do you really have rice and flour for the people who’ll come with you? You said that you need people to carry bricks, but you wouldn’t tell which kind of bricks, and where. You’re just deceiving those honest people who have nothing to eat, right?”</p> <p>“He’s right! You said that you have rice and flour. Aren’t you going to show us what you have? Only that way people can believe what you have said.”</p> <p>“I just want to know who are you people, and why do you have those expensive foods. Where did you get those foods? Except for those high-positioned people in the base center, who else can have so much rice to share with the others?”</p> <p>“I think carrying bricks might be real, but as for if there’ll really be food or not, and if they’ll really pay with rice… that needs to be proved.”</p> <p>The voices of doubt could be heard from all directions. Most of those people were just trying to stir up trouble, so they talked extra loudly.</p> <p>Hearing their words, some other people around turned their eyes to this area, expecting to watch a show.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and her friends only gave those people a bland glance.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing was relatively hot-tempered. He couldn’t help but angrily yell at those people who were making sarcastic comments, “What are you talking about? You can believe it or not, but you shouldn’t make it sound like we’re all liars, okay?”</p> <p>Lin Hao said coldly, “As for people like you, we won’t hire them even they want to come.”</p> <p>Those people laughed scornfully. “Ahya, like it’s real! Come on people, look! They don’t want to hire us. How ridiculous! Like we want to work for them!” One of them laughed.</p> <p>“Haha… You’re right!”</p> <p>“Hehe…”</p> <p>“Hah…”</p> <p>The laughter came from every direction. Some of the few men who came to talk to Lin Wenwen at first now hesitated as well.</p> <p>“Um, we should… look for other opportunities…”</p> <p>“Ugh, I… I’ll listen to you.”</p> <p>Only the man who was pushed out to talk to Lin Wenwen wasn’t affected by the others.</p> <p>He shook his head and said, “No, I believe what they said is true.”</p> <p>“Oi, don’t be silly… What if…” Seeing that he still wanted the job, a man behind him anxiously held his arm. He tried to say something, but paused after glancing at Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Wenwen shook her head with a faint smile, then said, “Are you idiots? Or, are you really stupid? What place do you think this is? Is this an underground market? Isn’t the reward content of every mission verified? Or, did the system of this place and the people who’re in charge here allow us in here knowing that we’re cheaters? Do you think that the people who’re working here are all useless ones who know nothing?”</p> <p>Her words successfully shut those troublemakers up and froze their proud smiles.</p> <p>She was right. This place was an important part of the base, meaning that the people who worked in this place were all subordinates of the three base leaders. Therefore, doubting the people who worked in this place equaled doubting the leaders’ subordinates, which could also equal to questioning the leaders themselves.</p> <p>That was a serious accusation!</p> <p>Just now, those people made irresponsible speeches only to feel good. They didn’t expect this pretty young woman to be such a fierce talker.</p> <p>“That… We didn’t say that! You said that!” Those perky people immediately drew back.</p> <p>Some people who had been silently watching whispered ‘idiots’. Of course, they referred to the few people who had tried to kick up a fuss.</p> <p>“Get out!” Lin Hao coldly stared at them and said, “I’ll remember you… We won’t hire you.”</p> <p>After that, Lin Wenwen said to the few commoners who intended to take the job, “You’re free to make your own decisions. We won’t force you. If you’re willing to take the job, please fill this form.”</p> <p>While speaking, she pointed at the stack of files on the stand.</p> <p>The few men glanced at each other again. Then, the man who firmly believed Lin Wenwen said, “I’ll do it.” While speaking, he walked to the stand, picked up the pen on it, and started writing.</p> <p>Seeing that he didn’t hesitate at all, the others all paused slightly. After that, they slowly followed him, waiting for him to finish the form.</p> <p>“Ugh, may I ask… when do we leave?” After filling the form, the man stepped aside to let the others do the forms. Meanwhile, he couldn’t help but asked Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“That depends,” said Lin Wenwen, “We need to recruit enough people before starting.”</p> <p>“Eh… When will it be? Are you going to hire many people?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen gave him a faint smile and responded, “We’re going to hire a hundred people. Judging by the current situation, we don’t know how long it’ll take for us to recruit a hundred people. By now, we have about fifty people, including you guys. We’ll leave the space when we have hired a hundred. After sending the first batch of people over there, we’ll come back to continue hiring.”</p>",
  "Chapter 318: Three-hundred People": "<p>At that point, a man standing behind this man asked, “Can we come back whenever we want?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen smiled faintly, then nodded and replied, “Yes, but you need to ask for leave.”</p> <p>The man looked at Lin Wenwen with hesitation, seemingly wanting to say something, but stopped on second thought.</p> <p>“What other question do you have?” Lin Wenwen asked him.</p> <p>Hearing that, the man responded with an embarrassed look, “Ugh… Can we leave early? Because we… we need food.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen paused slightly, then turned back to glance at the others.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing said, “But we only have fifty people now. There’re not enough workers yet. Besides, the trip won’t be easy. It’ll take at least five hours to make a round trip. It’ll consume a large amount of gas to make this trip.”</p> <p>Lin Hao and Lin Wenwen both nodded. They couldn’t possibly give these people food before the work started, so they would have to wait.</p> <p>“How’ bout this?” said Lin Wenwen, “You can go back and ask other people if they want to join us. For every person you recruit, you’ll be paid with half a pound of flour… white flour. What do you say?”</p> <p>Hearing her words, the five men had their eyes glowed brightly.</p> <p>“Re-really?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded, still carrying that faint smile.</p> <p>Most of the superpowered people in the hall were standing aside and watching them dubiously.</p> <p>After hearing Lin Wenwen’s positive answer, the few men who had filled the form left excitedly. Apparently, they had gone to find the other job-seekers.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and the others stayed in the Mission Hall for two hours. Except for the group of commoners, no one else came to them to apply for a job. Some people read the information on their signboard when passing by, then left with doubts.</p> <p>On the other side, not long after Xiao Yunlong had sent Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing away, another visitor came to Wu Chengyue’s place.</p> <p>“Chief, Chen Yuting is here to see you,” Xiao Licheng came in and reported.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was sitting on the couch, reading some files. Meng Yue was sitting on another couch, brushing Wu Yueling’s hair. The little girl was sitting on Meng Yue’s knees, with the gray rabbit in her arms. At that moment, she was feeding the rabbit a vegetable leaf.</p> <p>However, the gray ball of fur refused to eat the leaf.</p> <p>“Let him in.”</p> <p>Within the recent three days, Wu Chengyue was actually pretty sure that Wu Yueling wasn’t taken away by bad people, because he had found Chen Yuting and learned about Lin Feng and his people, including that lady with sunglasses, who had disappeared after entering the base.</p> <p>Soon, Chen Yuting walked in alone.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue raised his head to look at him, then asked with surprise, “Why are you alone?” While speaking, he pointed at the armchair beside him.</p> <p>Chen Yuting walked to the armchair, then sat down while replying, “Ran into Piao Gecang on my way here. We had a fight. My squad members are poisoned by his fire, so I dropped them in the hospital.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was picking up an empty glass on the table to get Chen Yuting some water. Hearing the latter’s words, he frowned, then turned to look at him and asked, “Piao Gecang? Why did you and him become enemies?”</p> <p>Chen Yuting thought for a moment, then said, “I guess he has found out about our relationship long ago. So, he has been bothering us with some small things.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded, then handed him the glass of water and said, “Em, I remember he’s close with a woman in your squad. This time, you let her die outside. He can use that as an excuse indeed.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting nodded knowingly and replied, “I’ve seen this coming. That woman could have come back safely, but she got herself killed. There’s no one else to blame for that.”</p> <p>While speaking, he glanced at Wu Yueling and asked, “Did the lady with sunglasses send Ling Ling back?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned to look at Ling Ling while responded smilingly, “She showed up in my home when we were having lunch, and gave Ling Ling back to me.”</p> <p>“That day, we didn’t see her while entering the base, so I thought she didn’t come in,” said Chen Yuting, “But to my surprise, she avoided all the detectors in the entrance and sneaked in. Why didn’t she just walk straight in with Lin Feng and the others?”</p> <p>He didn’t know that Ling Qiao took Wu Yueling away because the little girl’s power was waking up, but he understood that she wouldn’t have taken Wu Yueling away for no reason.</p> <p>Two days ago, Wu Chengyue suddenly found him and asked if he came back to the base with a short-haired, large-breasted lady who was wearing a hat and a pair of sunglasses.</p> <p>He did come back with a lady like that, but didn’t enter the base with her.</p> <p>After learning that Chen Yuting and his squad was going to work for that lady, Wu Chengyue asked him to tell whatever he knew about her. After that, Chen Yuting was told that his Chief’s little princess was kidnapped again. But this time, the one who took her away didn’t seem to want to harm her.</p> <p>Chen Yuting knew that because Wu Chengyue seemed to worry less after hearing his description of that lady.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue both glanced at Chen Yuting with curiosity. “Eh? So, that woman in your squad must have done something that she shouldn’t be doing, right?” Wu Chengyue asked.</p> <p>Chen Yuting nodded and replied, “The armed vehicle that we drove back to the base was lent to us by that lady with sunglasses. On our way back, Lu Ting got greedy. She asked one of our squad members who has spirit power to put us asleep, then tried to steal that vehicle. As a result, Miss. Lu killed her and her brother, Lu Changfeng.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue responded knowingly, “That Miss. Lu you’re talking about, she’s a tough one. You better not to offend her, or don’t blame me for being unable to help you.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting quickly nodded. He had only spent one day or two with Miss. Lu, but already learned about her strong vibe, and how decisive she was. She was truly a dangerous being, and he didn’t even know exactly how powerful she was.</p> <p>He asked Wu Chengyue curiously, “Chief, you seem to know Miss. Lu pretty well. How did you meet? Why did she take Ling Ling away without telling you?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue recalled that when meeting the female zombie for the first time, he gave her a thunder strike without thinking and pissed her off. As a consequence, she took his daughter far away, and he spent a long time chasing her.</p> <p>Nothing bad happened when they saw each other the second time. She gave Ling Ling back to him unharmed, and taught him one thing—not all zombies in this world had lost their humanity and sanity.</p> <p>The last time they met, he didn’t recognize her, as she had changed too much. Without using his superpower, he actually lost the fight with her, and bit her on a pretty private area of her body…</p> <p>Thinking of that, Wu Chengyue couldn’t help but cover his forehead with his hand, feeling both amused and annoyed.</p> <p>Then, he waved his hand and said to Chen Yuting, “Ah, no, she left a note to tell me, but I was too worried to think of it. Besides, I don’t know her well. I’ve only seen her a few times.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting nodded, then said, “Ah, our squad is going to carry bricks for them this time. Chief, don’t you think that you should send more people to go with us? I’ve observed them, and I have found that they have plenty of food. They’ve been making great offers as well. I don’t know where they found all that food though.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded, then picked up the two pages of the file he was reading earlier as he said, “You should know that they’re from the old Hades Base. The job they released in the Mission Hall is real. However, about the food you mentioned, Miss. Lu is in charge of that. She has plenty of ways to get great amounts of food. I plan to let her borrow these people from me. The winter is coming, so we should store as much food as possible. Otherwise, many more people in civilian areas will be starved to death, as they can’t get rich harvests out there during wintertime.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting took over the pages from him, then glanced at him with surprise and said, “Where did she get so much food?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and answered his question, “She is able to collect food in zombie cities. And, she has a space, doesn’t she? Even I don’t have the courage to go to the center of Hangzhou city, but she can go there with no problems at all. Apart from that, I think she used to be an elite special-forces soldier, which means she has rich military knowledge. So, she knows where the government used to store food back in the old world. This time, they came to our base because they want to hire people to build a new base for them. We don’t know the location of their new base yet, but I think it will be nearby.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting was shocked. He widened his eyes and asked, “Base? They’re going to build a new base? There were just a few of them! No wonder she said that we’re going to be construction workers. I guess they need us to build the fence wall, right?”</p> <p>“That’s right,” said Wu Chengyue, “We thought Yuan Tianxing and Lin Feng are their leaders, but Miss. Lu seems to have a greater right of making decisions than them.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting nodded in agreement and said, “Yes, and Miss. Lu is a strange person. She disappears all the time.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue pointed at the two pages in his hands and responded, “Good! If you’re going, you should take these people with you, and manage them.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting read the list on the pages. The names, powers, levels, genders, and home addresses of the three-hundred people were all listed.</p> <p>Seeing that about thirty of those people had superpowers, Chen Yuting said with surprise, “Are you sending so many superpowered people? Aren’t you preparing to go out of the base again to collect supplies?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded and said, “I don’t need so many people. In fact, I’m doing this mostly because I want to lend them a hand. After all, Miss. Lu has indeed done me a great favor this time.”</p> <p>While speaking, he turned and glanced at Ling Ling.</p> <p>Seeing his movement, Chen Yuting understood his meaning.</p> <p>“I’ll go tell them about it this afternoon,” he said.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded, then stood up and said, “Let’s go together. I need to go to the Administration Hall in Region D.”</p> <p>Then, he walked to Wu Yueling, bent over, and scooped her up while saying, “Ling Ling, let’s go out and take a walk.”</p> <p>Meng Yue held the gray rabbit which had hopped out of Wu Yueling’s arms.</p> <p>Wu Yueling put her arms around Wu Chengyue’s neck and simply glanced at him without making another response.</p> <p>After that, they walked out of the building together.</p>",
  "Chapter 319: Being Troubled by A Scum": "<p>In the afternoon, Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying left Lin Hao and Du Yuanxing in the Mission Hall and went to the market.</p> <p>Every region had its own market. Of course, when the market in one’s region failed to satisfy oneself, they were allowed to visit the markets in other regions.</p> <p>Administration centers were usually located in commercial buildings, and the Mission Hall occupied a floor in the administration building. The office of public security and other offices were all located in the administration buildings.</p> <p>So, without a doubt, the market was also located in the administration building, usually on floor one to three. As the base was densely-populated, even the old factory buildings and business streets had now become living spaces.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying went down to the market on the first floor. Many people had set up stalls there, waiting for people to trade with them. From furniture pieces to cleaning supplies, one could find all sorts of useful things that were selling well there. Apart from those, clothes, shoes, jewelry, beddings could also be seen there.</p> <p>Many of the merchandises here were collected by superpowered squads from the outside by taking risks. The people who weren’t willing to hand their harvests into the base were allowed to do free trades here.</p> <p>Clothes, shoes and accessories were mostly what girls were interested in. Normally, not many people would buy accessories like jewels.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying were mainly looking for clothes and shoes.</p> <p>People could find both brand-new clothes and old ones here. The new ones were surely very expensive; the older, the cheaper.</p> <p>Following behind Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying, were three men wearing camouflage suits and carrying rifles. They were both pretty. Most of the people in the market were extra polite to them, but there were still exceptions.</p> <p>“This pair of shoes is in my size. I want them.” On the second floor, Lin Wenwen stopped before a stall and pointed at a pair of canvas shoes.</p> <p>The stall owner was an about thirty years old man. He was lazily sitting in a chair, but when the two young ladies stopped before his stall, the look in his eyes changed a little. After all, Lin Wenwen was good-looking, seeming to be gentle and quiet.</p> <p>He immediately stood up, looking at Lin Wenwen’s young face obsessively while chuckling with a slightly wicked look in his eyes, “Ahyaya, pretty lady, you’re so beautiful! I wonder if you have a boyfriend or not.”</p> <p>As this man rudely asked her if she had a boyfriend, Lin Wenwen erased that faint smile on her face. She glanced at that man expressionlessly. The look in the man’s eyes made her uncomfortable, so she no longer wanted to purchase that pair of shoes.</p> <p>“Qingying, let’s go look in other places,” she turned and held Long Qingying’s hands, prepared to leave.</p> <p>“Oi… Don’t leave. Let’s chat. What’s the matter?” As the two girls prepared to leave, the man behind the stall quickly walked up to them, raising his arms to block their way.</p> <p>“Get out of the way!” Long Qingying said unreservedly with icy-cold voice.</p> <p>The man lewdly looked at Long Qingying from head to toe, then shook his head and showed dislike. “You have a good body shape, but this face of yours is too sour.” He clicked his tongue and said, “You’re not pretty, so why are you pretending to be so proud? No matter how proud you are, you’ll still be crying underneath men, won’t you?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen frowned slightly. Long Qingying directly raised a hand and pulled out half of the katana which was carried on her back while the frosty vibe from her charged at the man.</p> <p>The man took two steps backward with surprise, but didn’t seem to panic. Instead, he said in amazement, “Ouch, don’t always pull out your blade, okay? You’re not allowed to kill in the base, and you have to be aware of that.”</p> <p>As he stepped backward, Lin Wenwen immediately prepared to avoid him and leave.</p> <p>“Oi, pretty lady, don’t leave! You have to know that I already have my eyes on you, so you need to tell me if you have a man or not. If you do, break up with him now,” The man instantly stepped over and stopped Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Seeing that, Wei Jingchen, who had been following behind Lin Wenwen, quickly walked up and pulled the man away.</p> <p>“Sorry, please step aside…” The tall and sturdy Wei Jingchen would make any ordinary man feel pressure. However, that man didn’t take him seriously. He slightly raised his chin and said scornfully, “What? A commoner? You think you’re amazing because you’re tall? You think I’m gonna be afraid of you because you have a gun?”</p> <p>While speaking, he abruptly raised a hand to push Wei Jingchen.</p> <p>Wei Jingchen nimbly dodged his hand, then quickly turned his body and neatly pointed his gun at that man while cocking it.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen wanted no trouble. She took a step backward, then turned around and walked in the opposite direction. They could always leave from the other side.</p> <p>As Wei Jingchen stepped in and Lin Wenwen prepared to leave, that man had a sharp beam of light flashing across his eyes. Abruptly, he reached out a hand and grasped Wei Jingchen’s gun which was pointing at him, then twisted it before Wei Jingchen could react. He was many times faster than the latter.</p> <p>Next, the gun slipped out of Wei Jingchen’s hands and dropped onto the ground. In the moment when Wei Jingchen lost his gun and was panicked, the man lunged forward and threw a spin kick directly at his stomach.</p> <p>Thud! Wei Jingchen, who was over six feet tall, was sent flying three or four meters away, thudding against a pillar.</p> <p>It happened too fast that no one else could react. They just watched the tall and strong Wei Jingchen being easily kicked away by that man. The people around didn’t say anything, but stood at a distance and watched quietly.</p> <p>Long Qingying immediately pulled her out her blade.</p> <p>So, after kicking Wei Jingchen away, when the man steadied himself and turned back, he found the tip of a blade against his throat.</p> <p>He stopped moving, but was wearing a careless grin. “Ouch! Do you dare to cut my throat? Do you know who I am? I’m telling you, if you dare to do any harm to me, you’ll die soon.”</p> <p>Long Qingying narrowed her eyes and prepared to move her hand. However, someone suddenly clasped her hand to stop her from cutting through this obviously nasty man.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen stopped her while saying, “Qingying, calm down!”</p> <p>At that point, that man grinned at Lin Wenwen and said, “Ahyaya, I won’t ask you if you have a boyfriend again. You sleep with me tonight, then I’ll give you this pair of shoes for free. I’ll even give you clothes. You can choose any one of these. How about that?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen didn’t say anything, but held Long Qingying’s hand and walked toward Wei Jingchen. This time, that man didn’t try to stop her again, but stared at her back with an aggressive look.</p>",
  "Chapter 320: Teach the Bad Boy A Lesson": "<p>“How’re you doing? Are you hurt?” Lin Wenwen helped Wei Jingchen up while Long Qingying stood beside her, gazing at that man. Xing Le and the soldier who followed them here shielded her behind.</p> <p>“Eh-hem… I’m okay!” Wei Jingchen stood up, one hand covering his chest. After giving a cough, he shook his head and responded.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen turned to ask the soldier, “Do you know this man? Who is he?”</p> <p>That man was pretty arrogant. She believed that an ordinary superpowered man would never be so defiant.</p> <p>“He’s Chief Yang’s little brother, named Yang Hui,” the soldier answered her question.</p> <p>The others immediately took a knowing glance at that man. No wonder he had the guts of harass ladies in public. It turned out that he had someone powerful to depend on.</p> <p>“Let’s go,” said Lin Wenwen, “I don’t want any troubles.”</p> <p>If that were just an ordinary man, she could let Long Qingying pick up a fight against him. However, he was a base leader’s little brother. If the fight ever started, it would only bring more troubles.</p> <p>After all, they couldn’t afford to offend a base leader now.</p> <p>As they prepared to leave, a seven or eight years old boy suddenly showed up, quickly running toward Lin Wenwen from Wei Jingchen’s side.</p> <p>Wei Jingchen was still suffering a muffled pain from his chest, so he didn’t notice the boy’s approach.</p> <p>Also because the boy was small in size, the people on the scene all failed to notice him. He ran up to Lin Wenwen, then bent over and grasped the edge of Lin Wenwen’s skirt before lifting it with all strength. However, before the skirt was fully lifted, a hand showed up from thin air and grasped the boy’s wrist.</p> <p>“Ah!” Lin Wenwen who found that the boy was lifting her skirt couldn’t help but utter a slight scream.</p> <p>“Ah! Let go of me! Let go!” However, the boy’s screech could be heard right after Lin Wenwen’s voice.</p> <p>It was then that the people on the scene finally discovered that a boy suddenly had run out to lift Lin Wenwen’s skirt. However, before he finished, a man… Eh, no, a woman suddenly showed up and grabbed his hand to stop him.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen pressed her skirt and took a few steps away from the boy. She was already irritated because of the man, and now, she glared at the boy with both shame and anger.</p> <p>“Where is this kid from? Who are his parents?”</p> <p>Once she shouted that aloud, the crowd that gathered around to watch the show split up and made a path. A woman about thirty years old walked out with her head held high, holding the hand of a cute little girl.</p> <p>The woman raised her free hand and pointed at Lin Qiao who had the boy’s wrist grasped in her hand, then yelled, “Who are you? Let go of my boy!”</p> <p>By saying that, the woman had told the others that the boy was her son. However, she didn’t apologize to Lin Wenwen. On the contrary, she yelled at Lin Qiao, who had stopped her son.</p> <p>“Apologize first!” Before Lin Qiao responded, Long Qingying said what she had to say with a cold voice. Neither the boy nor his mother seemed to think that they were wrong, and that made Lin Wenwen and her friends even angrier.</p> <p>“Apologize? Why? My boy was playing with you, and it should be a pleasure of yours. Don’t be stupid!” The woman only gave a bland smile.</p> <p>“You!” Lin Wenwen popped her eyes in anger. She was too angry to say anything.</p> <p>If Lin Qiao didn’t suddenly show up to stop the boy, her skirt should have been lifted by the time she realized what had happened. If that really happened, all these people here would see her underpants! How would she face the others then?</p> <p>And now, the boy’s mother was even conniving him. She didn’t look guilty at all. On the contrary, she believed that what happened was reasonable.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen grabbed the boy’s wrist and read his mind. She knitted her brows and said to Lin Wenwen, “He was told to do so by some adult.”</p> <p>Hearing her words, Lin Wenwen paused in shock.</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao pointed at boy’s mother and continued, “That woman told him to do so.”</p> <p>“What!” Lin Wenwen widened her eyes as she couldn’t believe what she heard. She looked at Lin Qiao, then turned to that woman.</p> <p>“Let me go! Let me go! You’re hurting me!” The naughty boy who had been twisting his wrist abruptly yelled at Lin Qiao with a crying face. Then, he turned to his mother and shouted, “Mom! She’s breaking my wrist! It really hurts!”</p> <p>“You tomboy, let go of my son! Haven’t you heard me?” Seeing her son’s painful face, the woman turned anxious as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and responded, “Alright.” Then, she abruptly raised her arm and threw the boy away.</p> <p>“Ah!” The boy was thrown at the window over ten meters away.</p> <p>“My boy!” The woman was scared to death as she didn’t expect Lin Qiao to throw the kid toward the window. She screamed out loud, then dropped the little girl’s hand and darted at the window.</p> <p>It was the second floor. If the kid was thrown out of the window and fell to the ground, he would either die or be disabled.</p> <p>Everyone on the scene was shocked by Lin Qiao’s movement, without being able to react. Also, the window was far away. How did the lady with sunglasses manage to do that?</p> <p>The moment the boy was thrown out, Lin Qiao moved as well. She flashed to the window within a blink, then reached out a hand and grasped the boy’s collar. By that time, the naughty boy had already flown out of the window.</p> <p>Right then, the boy was dangling outside the window.</p> <p>“Ahhhhhh! Mom! Uncle! Help me!” Realizing what was happening, the boy immediately burst in cries. Hanging outside the window, he didn’t dare to move at all.</p> <p>“My boy!” The woman ran over while screaming. Who also rushed to the window was the man who had harassed Lin Wenwen just now.</p> <p>“Don’t move! If you come closer, I’ll drop him!” Before they approached the window, Lin Qiao abruptly raised an arm to stop them.</p> <p>“You… Give me my son back! Give my boy back!” The woman and the guy named Yang Hui both stopped. The woman was looking at the boy who was dangling outside the window by Lin Qiao, her face filled with fright. Unlike her, Yang Hui was staring at Lin Qiao with anger.</p> <p>“How dare you! Do you know who this kid is? If anything happens to him, even your lives won’t be enough!” Yang Hui didn’t think that Lin Qiao would actually be even more aggressive and bolder than he was.</p> <p>In this base, no one dared to do anything to him and this woman, because their big brother was a Chief. So, they had always been playing the bully in the base.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao actually dared to threaten Chief Yang’s nephew.</p> <p>As everyone else expected, once that man’s voice faded, a series of footsteps could be heard. Then, people turned back to find about twenty soldiers in the uniforms of the base rush up. They surrounded Lin Wenwen and her friends, pointing their guns at them.</p>",
  "Chapter 321: Too Far to be Heard": "<p>Long Qingying was already angry, and on seeing these soldiers pointing guns at her, she immediately exploded.</p> <p>As she raised a hand, those guns twisted, then flew out of their owners’ hands and gathered above the heads of Long Qingying and her friends before disintegrating. Soon, the guns turned into countless finger-thick metal thorns, pointing at those soldiers.</p> <p>However, Long Qingxing stopped herself from launching those metal thorns.</p> <p>“What? Encouraging your kid to harass strangers? Is that how people educate their children in your family?” Lin Qiao said to that woman with her hoarse voice.</p> <p>After saying that, she abruptly turned to Yang Hui, then continued knowingly, “Ah, that makes sense. The adults from your family are like this, so we can’t count on you to teach your children well. After all, the family has a great influence on a child. The children of dragons are still dragons, the children of phoenixes are still phoenixes, and the mouse cubs only know how to dig holes. Have you heard about that saying?”</p> <p>“Whoaaaa… Mama! Mama!” Outside the window, the boy was still calling his mom with fright, but Lin Qiao was showing no intention of pulling him back in.</p> <p>“I am telling you… if you dare to hurt my son, I’ll let every one of you suffer! Put my son back in now!” The woman growled at Lin Qiao with anger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the other, her eyes shining with a cold light. “Are you saying that I should loosen my grip right now?” she asked, “I can do that. And you can tell the Chief in your family to take revenge on us. We’ll be expecting that.”</p> <p>While speaking, she shook his head.</p> <p>“Whaaaaa….” Once she did that, the boy outside was scared out of his pants. The crotch of his trousers was wet, with light-yellow liquid dripping down.</p> <p>“No! Stop it!” The woman’s face turned pale with fear as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pointed at Lin Wenwen, then said to Yang Hui and the woman who looked like brother and sister, “Apologize to her… or, you won’t get your son back.”</p> <p>Yang Hui and his sister glanced at each other, then both turned to Lin Wenwen reluctantly and said ‘sorry’ through clenched teeth.</p> <p>“What did you say? You’re too far away, so I can’t hear you!” At this moment, Lin Wenwen had calmed herself down and erased the expression on her face. She responded to the two only with a bland look.</p> <p>“Louder! Didn’t you eat anything?” Lin Qiao immediately gave a cold shout.</p> <p>Then, she saw the two pop their eyes with anger, with veins standing out on their foreheads, under their skin. They clenched their fists and took a few deep breaths, then said loudly to Lin Wenwen, “Sorry!”</p> <p>Only after hearing that did Lin Qiao put the boy who had peed his pants back in, and dropped him on the ground.</p> <p>“My baby!” As Lin Qiao finally carried her son in, that woman immediately rushed over and squatted to hold the boy tight.</p> <p>“Whoaaa… Mama! Mama…”</p> <p>At that point, Lin Qiao glanced at the woman and his brother, who both had hatred in their eyes, and said blandly, “Don’t say that I didn’t warn you. If anything bad happens to any of us, I’ll find you. By then, I’d like to know how you will keep your two children safe. You need to know that Yang Chao is nothing in my eyes.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, she disappeared from where she was without leaving a trace, like a ghost. Watching that, the people around were all frightened, including Yang Hui and his sister.</p> <p>Earlier on, no one noticed how Lin Qiao showed up, and just now, she vanished right in front of everyone else. Quite some green-powered people were on the scene, but none of them manage to sense where she went.</p> <p>Also, judging by what she said before leaving, she didn’t seem to be afraid of Yang Chao the Chief at all.</p> <p>Suddenly, the woman raised her head as she pointed at Lin Wenwen and her friends while shouting at Yang Hui, “Brother, arrest them! I want them to know about the consequences of hurting my son!”</p> <p>Seeing her son trembling in her arms and emitting a urine smell, the hatred in her heart overpowered her sanity. Right now, she wanted nothing but revenge. As Lin Qiao had already disappeared, she immediately decided to take her revenge on Lin Wenwen and her friends.</p> <p>“Have you had enough?” At that point, a bland voice was suddenly heard from behind the crowd. The people on the scene glanced back at the source of the voice, then immediately stepped aside and made a way. After that, Wu Chengyue smilingly walked out of the crowd, with Wu Yueling carried in his arms.</p> <p>“Yang Hui, Yang Yan, these are all my guests. If you want to stir up trouble, you need to select your targets carefully.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smilingly walked to Lin Wenwen and her friends, the said to Lin Wenwen, “Miss. Lin, you can leave now. I’ll handle these people. But from now on, you should be more careful. After all, some people might try to stab you from the back.”</p> <p>“Thank you,” Lin Wenwen nodded at him and replied. She gave Yang Yan and Yang Hui a cold glance, then left with the others.</p> <p>Long Qingying waved a hand and sent the metal thorns above her head fleetingly toward those soldiers who had pointed guns at her earlier. Following a series of puffing noise, the thorns all stuck in the ground, centimeters away from those soldiers’ feet.</p> <p>After that, the soldiers who followed Lin Wenwen and her friends here walked to Wu Chengyue and whispered a few words in his ear.</p> <p>“Wu Chengyue! You can’t protect them! They’ve messed up with people that they shouldn’t! And I’ll let them know about that!” Yang Yan wasn’t willing to give up after hearing Wu Chengyue’s words. Instead, she angrily yelled at him. However, she let Lin Wenwen and her friends leave without chasing after them.</p> <p>After yelling at Wu Chengyue, she quickly scooped up her son and walked toward her daughter, who had been stunned the whole time.</p> <p>“Yunyun, let’s go back.”</p> <p>Yang Hui followed behind her and held her daughter’s hand before leaving together with them. He didn’t even pack the merchandises on his stall, as no one dared to touch them anyway.</p> <p>Looking at the two groups of people who were leaving, Wu Chengyue sighed helplessly.</p> <p>He was going to take a detour through the passageway nearby, but then got attracted by the screams from this area. As he came over, he saw people crowded in this place, so he figured that something must have happened here.</p> <p>As he got closer, he saw the female zombie dangling Yang Chao’s nephew outside the window, threatening to throw him down.</p> <p>At that time, Yang Yan and Yang Hui were both wearing a frightened look. Based on how those two usually behaved, Wu Chengyue guessed that they must have offended the zombie lady first, which made the latter threaten them like this.</p> <p>He watched for a while, then heard the zombie lady demand the two to apologize to Lin Wenwen. That proved his guess.</p> <p>He felt that the zombie lady was giving tit for tat.</p> <p>Didn’t the woman encourage her son to play practical jokes on the other? So, the zombie lady played an awful joke on the boy.</p> <p>However, the zombie lady didn’t seem to have considered the possible consequences. Yang Chao might want revenge on Lin Wenwen and her friends after this.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue thought for a moment, then said to Meng Yue, “Send a few people to secretly protect those people. If anything happens to them, let me know as fast as possible.”</p> <p>Meng Yue nodded, then turned and left.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Wu Chengyue carried Wu Yueling and left with his other few subordinates.</p>",
  "Chapter 322: Being Targeted": "<p>“I told you not to wear dresses, but you wouldn’t listen to me. See, now we’re in trouble,” Long Qingying looked at the angry Lin Wenwen and said.</p> <p>“How am I supposed to know? I thought we don’t need to travel around in this base like outside. But, we actually ran into such a disgusting family, ugh!” Lin Wenwen said unhappily. Then, she thought of something, and stopped abruptly to look around.</p> <p>“Miss. Lu, are you here? I know you are. Thank you for helping me just now!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao showed up beside her and said, “You need to be more careful in crowded places. You’re a girl, and you’re pretty. This isn’t your Hades Base, so the people here won’t be afraid of you. Also, Wu Chengyue was right. From now on, you all need to stay on alert against Yang Chao. He’ll definitely try to take revenge on us.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen quickly nodded and responded, “Em, I get it.”</p> <p>At that moment, Long Qingying suddenly asked, “Where have you been these days? Didn’t you go after Deputy Chief Yuan that day? But, he told us it was Lili who found him, and not you.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to walk forward while answering her question, “I was in my space, handling some things. It was done today, so I came out. Unexpectedly, I found you in trouble once I got out. You’re both girls, so can you not always run about?”</p> <p>While talking to Lin Wenwen, she couldn’t help but always use the instructive tone that she used to employ on her before.</p> <p>“Alright,” Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying both nodded, then followed behind Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After arriving at the Mission Hall, they saw Chen Yuting standing by their stand, talking to Lin Hao and Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>“Eh? Why are you here? Have you found more people for us?” Lin Wenwen walked over and asked curiously. The few people who were having a conversation turned to look at them. Upon seeing Lin Qiao who hadn’t shown up for days, they all paused slightly.</p> <p>Chen Yuting reacted pretty quickly as he nodded and smiled, “Ah, you guessed right. I’ve indeed brought you some people.”</p> <p>“How many?” Lin Wenwen asked with glowing eyes, and Chen Yuting showed her three fingers.</p> <p>“Thirty?” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“Three hundred,” said Lin Hao.</p> <p>“Really! That’s great! But… Captain Chen, where did you find so many people?” Lin Wenwen was thrilled the moment she heard the number. But right afterward, she asked with confusion.</p> <p>“I didn’t find them,” said Chen Yuting, “Chief Wu sent them to you.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen, Lin Qiao, and the others were all puzzled.</p> <p>“Chief Wu? He sent three-hundred people to help us?”</p> <p>Chen Yuting nodded.</p> <p>“That’s wonderful. So, we can start working very soon, right?” Lin Wenwen said excitedly, looking at the others with sparkling eyes. Lin Hao and the others all nodded in agreement.</p> <p>“Ah, but we need to wait for the five who came here for interviews today,” said Du Yuanxing, “Or, maybe we can send someone where they live to tell them about the news. They all live in the same place anyway.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded and said, “Tonight when we get back, we’ll tell our brother and Tianxing to decide on the time of departure, then we’ll send someone to tell them.”</p> <p>The others nodded.</p> <p>In a room on the other side of the Mission Hall, Piao Gecang stood by the window, his eyes fixed on Long Qingying.</p> <p>“Who’re they?” He asked the man behind him.</p> <p>That man who had been drinking tea was no one else but Yang Hui, who was in the market downstairs just now. Hearing the question, he stood up and walked to Piao Gecang’s side, then glanced where the latter was looking.</p> <p>“Ah, those people are from the destroyed Hades Base. Just now, they had a fight with my little sister and humiliated us! Which one do you like? The one with a katana? I have my eyes on the one in a dress. She’s mine,” said Yang Hui.</p> <p>Piao Gecang licked his dry lips, his eyes showing the lust for possession. “No, I like the one with a katana. Look at how straight her back is. The cold vibe of hers… I wonder if she’ll act differently when she’s screwed by a man,” he clicked his tongue and continued, “Even thinking about that turns me on.”</p> <p>“Wu Chengyue has said that these Hades Base people are under his protection,” said Yang Hui worriedly, “So, if you want to do something, better not let him find out. Or, you’ll be dealing with the consequences alone.”</p> <p>Piao Gecang responded scornfully, “Under his protection? So what? Isn’t that Chen Yuting under his protection too? I’ve already slept with that man’s wife today. But, that was just an ordinary woman, nothing fun. If she didn’t have those large breasts, I’d get tired of her very soon.”</p> <p>Yang Hui looked at him with surprise and asked, “You had Chen Yuting’s woman? Where’s she now?”</p> <p>“Still in Region F,” said Piao Gecang, “I gave her to my brothers as a reward.”</p> <p>Yang Hui’s expression turned slightly serious as he said, “You better not let anyone else find out about it, or not even my boss can protect you. You need to know what results raping women in the base can lead to.”</p> <p>“No, they won’t find her,” said Piao Gecang carelessly.</p> <p>At night, Lin Wenwen and her friends went back and gave Lin Feng Chen Yuting’s name list, as well as the names of the people who were newly recruited today.</p> <p>While reading the list, Lin Feng nodded and said, “Eh, this afternoon when we were in his place, Chief Wu had told us that he would send some people to help us. We’ll pay them with food according to the grades of their jobs.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing sat beside him and said, “Now, we have about three hundred and fifty people in total. We still need a few trucks to bring these people there.”</p> <p>After saying that, he glanced at Lin Qiao who was playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with Lin Xiaolu, then continued, “But for the sake of Miss. Lu, Chief Wu solved the truck problem for us.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced back at Yuan Tianxing, then responded with her dry voice, “Em, he does know how to return favors.”</p> <p>Lin Xiaolu looked at her and asked with curiosity, “Last time when Xiaolu triggered her power, you only spent a night to wake her up. But, why did you spend three days to help Chief Wu’s daughter this time? Is that because Chief Wu’s daughter was too young?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao responded, “No, it was because when I found her, her power has been waking up for days. Yuan Tianxing had suspended the progress with my lake water, but too much energy had accumulated inside her body. We had to spend more time to channel that energy, as we were worried that his daughter’s body might not be able to take it.”</p> <p>“When will we leave then?” Yuan Tianxing asked, “We’ll bring this batch of people there.”</p> <p>Lin Feng glanced at him, then at Lin Qiao. “What do you think?” he asked Lin Qiao, “You picked the location, so you can also arrange the time.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded to agree.</p> <p>Lin Qiao continued the game with Lin Xiaolu while replying, “Tomorrow afternoon… We’ll leave at two o’clock.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “Good! Tomorrow morning, I’ll send someone to inform the people we interviewed today, as well as Chen Yuting.”</p>",
  "Chapter 323: You Survived": "<p>After Yuan Tianxing said that he would send someone to inform Chen Yuting and his people tomorrow morning, Lin Qiao added, “Lili, Mengmeng, and I will go with the first batch of people to suppress the zombies in that area. After that, I’ll leave the two of them there, and come back with you to bring more people there.”</p> <p>Next morning, people left the accommodation early. Lin Wenwen stayed in the base while the other members of Lin Family left with the first batch of workers.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen, Long Qingying, and Yuan Tianxing stayed in the base to hire more people. After recruiting enough people for the second batch, they would head to the new base.</p> <p>After arriving at the administration building, Lin Feng asked Li Zheng and his people to inform the others.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had been staring at Lin Yu since they left the accommodation early in the morning. Lin Yu sneakily told Lin Hao about it when all his fine hair started to stand straight up under Lin Qiao’s gaze.</p> <p>“Why do I feel that Miss. Lu’s eyes which are hiding behind her sunglasses have been fixed on me the whole time?”</p> <p>Lin Hao glanced at Lin Qiao and saw that she was looking at Lin Yu. So, he turned back to Lin Yu and asked him, “Did you do something to her?”</p> <p>Lin Yu quickly shook his head and said, “I didn’t do anything! This is the first time I have seen her. I’ve only been hearing about her from you guys before…”</p> <p>While speaking, he saw Lin Qiao walking toward him. Out of fear, he immediately shut his mouth. Afterward, both he and Lin Hao confusedly watched Lin Qiao walk up to the former.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over and stood in front of Lin Yu. It was the first time that she saw this man. As he had been staying with Li Zheng and his people, she guessed that he was one of them.</p> <p>She rested one hand on her waist and rubbed her chin with the other. After looking at Lin Yu from head to toe, she abruptly leaned toward him and sniffed at him.</p> <p>Once she got closer, Lin Yu was frightened so badly that he didn’t even dare to move.</p> <p>Lin Hao watched Lin Qiao’s moves with curiosity and couldn’t help but ask, “What’s wrong? Does he have a problem?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao straightened her body, then looked at Lin Yu and said, “I know you. But I remember that… were you dying two months ago? Why’re you alive again? You didn’t become a zombie, but a superpowered man.”</p> <p>As she got close to Lin Yu and detected his smell, she recalled where she had seen him before.</p> <p>Wasn’t he the dying man whom she saved in a warehouse not long after she woke up as a zombie? That was before she rescued Wu Yueling. She also remembered that she had accidentally bitten him.</p> <p>Wasn’t this guy at his last breath back then? Why was he standing right in front of her pretty energetically right now?</p> <p>She didn’t remember making him drink the lake water, nor getting him into the lake. Reasonably speaking, the virus should have been spread in his body and turned him into a zombie.</p> <p><em>‘What happened instead of that? Damn! What brought him back to life? Did his power wake up when he was dying? Or what else…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao spent some time thinking while rubbing her chin, then showed a confused look, gazing at Lin Yu. Her fingers just couldn’t stop gently scratching her chin.</p> <p>Lin Yu was already stunned by what she had said. Why did she know that he was dying, and that he was supposed to turn into a zombie?</p> <p>Li Zheng had given his teammates strict orders not to tell anyone about that. Therefore, not even Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing knew about what had happened to Lin Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Lin Yu were both shocked. At that moment, they couldn’t make any other reaction except staring at each other.</p> <p>The others were all puzzled upon hearing what Lin Qiao said. Lin Hao didn’t know what had happened to Lin Yu, so he was confused too. But still, he managed to dig out some information from Lin Qiao’s words.</p> <p>“Eh? Why would Lin Yu turn into a zombie? Have you met him before? Ah, you were heading South from Sea City two months ago. At that time, Lin Yu and his teammates were coming this way as well. I guess you met each other on the way,” he said to Lin Qiao. Afterward, he turned to ask Lin Yu, “Were you bitten by zombies?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was still staring at Lin Yu when she responded to Lin Hao, “Yeah, I met him on my way to South.”</p> <p>Lin Yu’s face was filled with shock and confusion. He didn’t know how to answer Lin Hao’s question.</p> <p>“I remember that you were bitten by me back then,” she said to Lin Yu with curiosity, “My teeth have the virus on them!”</p> <p>After saying that, he pointed at Lin Yu’s chest.</p> <p>Hearing her words, Lin Yu suddenly came back to his senses. The look on his face changed slightly, then he looked at Lin Qiao with surprise, confusion, and a series of complicated feelings.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was very close to him, and his feelings were very obvious. So, she immediately sensed his thoughts.</p> <p>At that time, the confusion and helplessness that Lin Yu had when he woke up in that warehouse were replaying in his head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said knowingly, “Ah, I understand! You woke up that night and found that you had survived. You even cut yourself to see if your blood was still red.”</p> <p>“I… I have been wondering where did this bite mark come from,” Lin Yu started talking, “But, if you ask me why I survived, I believe it must have something to do with this bite mark. Knowing that it was you back then, I’m really relieved!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was puzzled at first, then said with disbelief, “What? Can my teeth do that? Are you saying that as long as I bite the people who are bitten by zombies before they die, I can save them from the virus? That is an invalid assumption.”</p> <p>“But, I didn’t know anything back at that time…” said Lin Yu, “I don’t even know what happened to me. Except for that bite mark, every part of my body is still the same. If you didn’t save me, who did?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a moment thinking while scratching her chin, then said, “Do you remember what time you woke up?”</p> <p>“It should be one or two am,” Lin Yu answered that question without hesitation.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for another moment, then responded, “I think I had left at that time as well. I remember bringing you into my space, but I didn’t do anything to you… well, apart from falling upon you and accidentally biting you.”</p> <p>She combined Lin Yu’s words with her memories and pondered over it, then felt that it could really be her teeth which had saved Lin Yu. <em>‘No way! </em>‘ she thought.</p> <p>After hearing their conversation, the others looked at them dumbfounded.</p> <p>“You… Miss. Lu, don’t your teeth have the virus on them? Or… can they only deliver the opposite effect to the people who are already infected by the virus?” Lin Hao looked at Lin Qiao and asked with a frown while thinking.</p> <p>As a former medical school student, he was more sensitive to this kind of a question than the others.</p> <p>“I don’t think so…” Lin Qiao looked at him and said.</p> <p>Lin Hao looked at her and said with curiosity, “Maybe… you should give it a try. Go find an animal which was bitten by zombies but is not dead yet and bite it, then see what’ll happen.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao gazed at him with a weird look while saying, “I think I’ll just eat it.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Hao didn’t know what to say.</p>",
  "Chapter 324: Ready to Go": "<p>Early in the morning, Wu Chengyue, Meng Yue, Xiao Yunlong, and Chen Yuting were all in the living room of Wu Chengyue’s place. Chen Yuting was very pallid and anxious, pacing before the tea table with bloodshot eyes. The others were also wearing a grim look.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at him and asked, “Are you so sure that Piao Gecang kidnapped your wife? Can you prove that?”</p> <p>Chen Yuting shook his head and responded angrily, “Yesterday morning, he blocked my way and gave me a hard time. Before leaving, he said that I’ll certainly go find him again. I don’t think anyone else would do it but him. Everyone in the base knows that he’s sick, and he likes to abuse women. None of the women who were raped by him survived! And now, my Jen is missing… It must be him!”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong glanced at Wu Chengyue, then said in agreement, “It might really be him.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded, then replied with a frown, “But, we don’t have any proof. He’s a Deputy Chief of this base after all. And for now, the most important things is that we need to find her first.”</p> <p>Then, he turned to Chen Yuting and asked, “Do you have any leads? Do you know where she was kidnapped?”</p> <p>“My teammates who were responsible for her safety told me that they were knocked out in an empty place. Quite some people attacked them. When they woke up, Jen was already missing. My people have searched that area, but found nothing,” said Chen Yuting.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue thought for a moment, then looked at Meng Yue and said, “Meng Yue will go to that place with you. Maybe she can find something.”</p> <p>Meng Yue nodded.</p> <p>Chen Yuting knew that Meng Yue had green power, so he nodded and said, “Alright. Sorry to trouble you, Miss. Meng.”</p> <p>“It’s okay,” Meng Yue gave a smile.</p> <p>At that moment, Xiao Licheng walked in and said, “Chief, a man from Hades Base is here.”</p> <p>The people in the living room all turned to Xiao Licheng. “I think he’s here to inform them to get ready to leave. Let him in.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!”</p> <p>“Morning, everyone,” Li Zheng walked in. He was here to borrow vehicles from Wu Chengyue. Seeing Chen Yuting, he was slightly surprised.</p> <p>“Eh? Captain Chen? You came to Chief Wu’s place so early?” he said.</p> <p>Li Zheng had sent Lei Yao to Chen Yuting’s place to inform him, and the others to find the people who had applied for the job by themselves.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong quickly stood up and said, “Ah, you’re here to borrow vehicles, right? The vehicles are all prepared for you. Where will you gather? When will you leave?”</p> <p>Li Zheng confusedly glanced at Chen Yuting. Hearing Xiao Yunlong’s questions, he turned back and replied, “Two o’clock this afternoon. We’ll gather on the square before the administration building in Region D.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll tell the drivers to drive the vehicles to that spot by two. The three-hundred people from our side will be there along with the vehicles.”</p> <p>Li Zheng smilingly nodded and said, “Great! Chief Wu, thank you for sending those people and lending us the vehicles!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue shook his head and said politely, “You’re welcome. We’re collaborating, and you’ll be paying them with food. With this job, many people won’t need to worry about being starved to death during the coming winter.”</p> <p>Li Zheng nodded, then turned to Chen Yuting and said, “Captain Chen, there should be no problem on your side, right? Can your people all get ready at noontime? You don’t look good now. Did something bad happen?”</p> <p>Chen Yuting responded with a glum look, “I… I might not be able to go with you for now.” While speaking, he turned to glance at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue thought for a moment, then said to Xiao Yunlong, “Yunlong, maybe you should go with them and lead the group. I’ll help to deal with Chen Yuting’s problem.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong nodded, then walked to Chen Yuting and patted him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, you’ll find your wife.” After saying that, he walked to the door.</p> <p>Li Zheng looked at Chen Yuting with confusion, but felt inappropriate to ask him about what had happened. So, with no better choice, he decided to leave. “I’ll be going then. You guys carry on.”</p> <p>He turned and made two steps forward, but then suddenly paused and turned around to say to Chen Yuting, “Ugh, if you need any help, just tell us.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting nodded slightly at him and replied, “Em, thank you!”</p> <p>When Li Zheng was leaving, Wu Chengyue looked at his back and thought of that zombie lady.</p> <p>Wasn’t she a zombie? She must be very sensitive to the scents of human beings. If she helped, Chen Yuting’s wife might be located within a shorter time.</p> <p>With that thought, he abruptly reached out a hand toward Li Zheng who was walking out and said, “Please wait!”</p> <p>Li Zheng and Xiao Yunlong stopped together, then turned back to look at him confusedly.</p> <p>“Eh, what’s up?” said Li Zheng.</p> <p>“Where’s Miss. Lu?” asked Wu Chengyue, “I wonder if we can invite her here?”</p> <p>Li Zheng looked at him with confusion while answering his question, “You want to see Miss. Lu? I need to go back and ask her.”</p> <p>“Then please go back and tell her that I need to ask her a favor,” said Wu Chengyue, “I wonder what she’ll want us to pay her in return.”</p> <p>Li Zheng nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll tell her what you said.”</p> <p>As Li Zheng left, Wu Chengyue looked at Chen Yuting and said, “I have an idea. If Miss. Lu agrees to help, we should be able to find your Jen very quickly.”</p> <p>“Really?” Chen Yuting asked eagerly, his face brightening up.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave a confident smile and said, “She isn’t an ordinary being. In terms of finding people, I think she’s even better than Meng Yue.” While speaking, he turned to glance at her.</p> <p>Meng Yue looked at him with a weird look and said, “You want to use her as an army dog, don’t you?”</p> <p>She had learned that Miss. Lu was the female zombie who had suffered a lightning strike from Wu Chengyue. Without a question, she also understood how sensitive zombies were to the scents of human beings. Zombies had a sharper sense of smell than even dogs, especially the high-level ones.</p> <p>Hearing her, the smile on Wu Chengyue’s face turned mysterious. “Hah, you can’t say that in front of her, or you’ll fall in trouble… I’m telling you.”</p> <p>Meng Yue rolled her eyes toward him.</p> <p>Chen Yuting didn’t know who Lin Qiao was, so he couldn’t understand the meaning of this short conversation between Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue.</p> <p>At that point, a gray rabbit hopped downstairs. Following behind it, Wu Yueling came down step by step, her hands holding the guardrail.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue immediately turned around and said, “Ling Ling is up!”</p> <p>Seeing him walk over, Wu Yueling stopped walking and just reached out her arms, waiting for him to scoop her up. Wu Chengyue walked to her and carried her in his arms, then rubbed her disheveled soft hair.</p> <p>“Are you hungry? Shall we go wash your face and brush your teeth?” he asked.</p> <p>Wu Yueling glanced at the two people in the living room, then looked at the gray rabbit which had hopped downstairs, and ultimately nodded.</p>",
  "Chapter 325: Use Her As An Army Dog": "<p>Li Zheng and Xiao Yunlong split up. Xiao Yunlong needed to inform the three-hundred people, and tell Chen Yuting’s vice-captain to gather his people on the square.</p> <p>When Li Zheng returned to the square, Lei Yao came back ahead of the others.</p> <p>Seeing Li Zheng, Lei Yao said, “Chen Yuting isn’t there. I heard from his neighbors that he didn’t come home last night. It seems that his wife is missing.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Li Zheng recalled that Chen Yuting did look very not good earlier in Wu Chengyue’s place. So, he nodded and said, “I saw him in Chief Wu’s place. He’s very anxious indeed.”</p> <p>“Will he still come with us then?” said Lei Yao.</p> <p>Li Zheng shook his head, then walked to Lin Qiao and Lin Feng, “Wu Chengyue’s motorcade will arrive with his three-hundred people by two. And, he wants to see you in his place. I think he’s going to ask you for a favor, and he said you can ask for a payback.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him with confusion, saying, “I heard what you said just now. I guess Chen Yuting couldn’t find his wife last night, so he went to Wu Chengyue this morning to ask him for help. But, what does Wu Chengyue want me to do?”</p> <p>Li Zheng shook his head as well and said, “I have no idea. He only told me that he’s wondering what you’d like in return.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment. <em>‘Did that man find out that I’m a zombie? Does he want me to find Chen Yuting’s wife? But, I don’t think I’ve ever taken off my sunglasses in front of him. How did he find out?’ </em>she wondered.</p> <p>With that thought, she believed that she was wrong.</p> <p>If Wu Chengyue did know that she was a zombie, wouldn’t he kick her out of the base? Didn’t he worry that she might lose control in the base?</p> <p>Also, why did he want to see her? Did he want her to help in finding the missing woman? Did he see her as a police dog?</p> <p>She rolled her eyes, then glanced at her watch and found that it was not yet ten o’clock. It was still four hours till departure, so she decided to visit Wu Chengyue and see what was going on there.</p> <p>If what Li Zheng said was true, she would help as long as Wu Chengyue send another hundred people to work for her.</p> <p>“Alright, I’ll go,” she said to Li Zheng. After that, she told Lin Feng about it, then headed to Wu Chengyue’s place.</p> <p>The woman who had been kidnapped by Piao Gecang’s people, and was now kept in a room in Region F, was named Shen Yujen. She was Chen Yuting’s wife.</p> <p>By now, she looked way worse than she yesterday. At the moment, she was lying on the bed like a broken doll. Her clothes were ragged, her snow-white skin covered in bruises; her private part was messy and blood-stained.</p> <p>There were wounds on her face too. Her eyes were half closed and unfocused, fixed on the ceiling.</p> <p>After Piao Gecang raped her yesterday, the other men came into this room one after another to rape her violently. She didn’t even know how many men had come in and left, and how many times she was rapped since yesterday noon.</p> <p>It lasted the whole night. The darkness of the night wasn’t as scary as those men who had lain upon her, and whom she couldn’t see clearly.</p> <p>In the morning, she was already falling unconscious, and her breath became weak.</p> <p>At that point, the few men outside the door said with regret, “We did it too hard. I think that woman will die in a couple of hours.”</p> <p>“Damn! It’s all your fault. I’ve told you to keep it easy. We should keep her alive for future use. But, you all acted like you had never touched a woman! Say it, how many times did you get into this room?”</p> <p>“Three times…”</p> <p>“Four…”</p> <p>“Twice…”</p> <p>“Twice…”</p> <p>“See? She’s just a commoner? How could you play with her like that? Could her weak body ever survive?”</p> <p>“Eh, it won’t be a big deal if she dies. Now, we should think about how to deal with the body.”</p> <p>“Just secretly throw it out of the base.”</p> <p>“How? The fence wall is guarded. We’ll be spotted once we go up.”</p> <p>The few men were talking about how to dump Shen Yujen’s body. She wasn’t dead yet, but at this moment, those men had already been seeing her as a dead person.</p> <p>“Wait, I have an idea. Don’t they need zombies in the research institute? We can simply turn that woman into a zombie, then send her over there.” A man suddenly came up with this idea, then said it out loud, his eyes glowing.</p> <p>The others looked at him and asked confusedly, “Turn her into a zombie? How? First of all, where can we find the zombie virus?”</p> <p>The man who brought up this idea gave a wicked grin and said, “We don’t need to worry about that. I can get the zombie virus right now. You need to destroy her face, so people won’t recognize her. Wait for me to come back.”</p> <p>While speaking, he quickly turned and left, leaving the others glancing at each other.</p> <p>“What a shame! I haven’t had enough of that woman.”</p> <p>“Yeah, she’s too easy to break!”</p> <p>“Hah, she’s dying anyway. Why don’t we get in now and do it again while she’s still breathing? We won’t have another chance if we miss this one. We don’t know when such a nice thing will happen to us again.”</p> <p>“I like this idea.”</p> <p>“Let’s get in.”</p> <p>Then, the few men immediately turned and walked into that dark room and started another round of abuse on the woman who was lying motionlessly on the bed.</p> <p>On the other side, Chen Yuting had been restlessly waiting to hear from Li Zheng, so was Wu Chengyue. About half an hour later, Xiao Licheng ran into the living room and said, “Chief, Miss. Lu is here.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was having breakfast with Wu Yueling in the dining room. Hearing Xiao Licheng’s words, he immediately nodded and said, “Let her in.”</p> <p>In the living room, Chen Yuting hurriedly stood up from the couch.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng turned and left; soon, Lin Qiao walked in.</p> <p>“Tell me, what can I do for you?” Her hoarse voice was heard.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue raised his head to look at her. However, before he said anything, Wu Yueling, who was sitting in front of him, threw her fork into her bowl, then slid off the chair and happily rushed toward Lin Qiao. Her tiny flipflops slapped the floor loudly.</p> <p>“Oi, you haven’t finished your breakfast yet!” The surprised Wu Chengyue watched his daughter run excitedly toward the zombie.</p> <p>Once he said that, he saw the rabbit hop toward Lin Qiao as well. It actually hopped so high!</p> <p>Seeing the little one cheerfully running to her, Lin Qiao smilingly bent over and scooped her up.</p> <p>“Are you full?”</p> <p>While speaking, she walked to the couch and sat down, as if it were her own home.</p> <p>“Say it, what you want me to do for you? If it’s gonna be a deal, I only want more people who can work for me,” she said.</p> <p>Chen Yuting hurriedly said to her, “Miss. Lu, can you help me look for my wife?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him, then nodded and responded, “I already know what happened to your wife. If you only want me to find her, you’ll have to send fifty more people to work for me… if you need me to find her and bring her back, that’ll be a hundred people.”</p>",
  "Chapter 326: That Direction": "<p>Looking at Wu Yueling and the rabbit which had hopped over to Lin Qiao’s side, Wu Chengyue couldn’t help but fix his eyes on Lin Qiao with a weird look. She was a zombie, wasn’t she? Why did the kids and animals all want to get close to her? Did her body contain something that attracted them?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue cared a lot about the fact that his daughter was almost closer to Lin Qiao than to him.</p> <p>“Only fifty people? I thought you’d ask for something else,” he walked over and sat on the couch.</p> <p>Lin Qiao put Wu Yueling on her knees, then turned to look at him while responding, “You should know that what we need the most at the moment are people, and nothing else.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded and replied, “Em, you’re right.”</p> <p>“Tell me,” Lin Qiao continued, “Do you want me to take you to her, or bring her back to you. Fifty people for the former, and a hundred for the latter.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at Chen Yuting who was extremely anxious, then said, “Take us to her. We’ll send you the people you need. And for their remuneration, we can give you a ten-percent discount. How about that?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao quickly nodded and said, “Alright.”</p> <p>Then, she turned to Chen Yuting and said, “Your wife is missing. Do you have anything that belongs to her? I need to confirm her scent.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting glanced at Wu Chengyue with surprise and saw that the latter was wearing a faint smile. After that, he quickly took a broken bracelet out of his pocket and handed it to Lin Qiao, “This is Jen’s bracelet. She lost it in where she was kidnapped yesterday.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao took over the bracelet and put it before her nose before sniffing at it, then gave it back to Chen Yuting.</p> <p>“I understand.”</p> <p>She put Wu Yueling on the couch, then said to her, “Little one, sit here for a while. I’ll be back very soon.”</p> <p>While speaking, she put the fluffy rabbit which had hopped onto the couch into the little girl’s arms.</p> <p>Wu Yueling held the rabbit as she looked at Lin Qiao and nodded obediently. After that, Lin Qiao stood up and walked toward the door. Wu Chengyue and Chen Yuting both stood up as well, following her out.</p> <p>Chen Yuting followed Lin Qiao closely. However, once they were out, he saw Lin Qiao slightly bend her knees and then directly leap onto the roof of Wu Chengyue’s home, then jump on top of the utility pole nearby.</p> <p>She quietly stood on top of the utility pole and looked around.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue said to Xiao Licheng after coming out, “Gather thirty men… get ready for action.”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng immediately nodded, then turned and left quickly.</p> <p>Afterward, Wu Chengyue walked to Chen Yuting’s side and raised his head to look at Lin Qiao as well. Then, Lin Qiao leaped down and lightly landed before them.</p> <p>“That direction. I have to tell you that you need to move fast, because…” Lin Qiao pointed at Region F and paused slightly, then looked at Chen Yuting and continued, “Her vibe is already very weak. You might not be able to save her if you didn’t get there quickly enough.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting slightly widened his eyes as the look on his face changed.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s face darkened as well. He turned and began walking toward the outside, saying, “Let’s go!”</p> <p>Behind him, Xiao Licheng soon drove out an off-road vehicle.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat onto the front seat, then pointed at Region F and said, “Over there, the area with very mixed scents.”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng glanced at her and asked uncertainly, “Is it Region F?”</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Chengyue got into the back seat and said, “It’s Region F… We need to be there as soon as possible.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir,” Xiao Licheng immediately started the car and began driving.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced back at Wu Chengyue. He was always smiling, so people couldn’t figure out what he was thinking about. He wore that mysterious smile around everyone except his little princess.</p> <p>“You do understand me,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“I was just guessing,” Wu Chengyue responded smilingly, “We can all guess that because you’re pointing at that area.”</p> <p>“Why are you so sure then?” asked Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t answer his question, but smilingly stared at her sunglasses. Lin Qiao confusedly glanced at him again, then stopped talking to him.</p> <p>She couldn’t understand the look in his eyes.</p> <p>At that point, Wu Chengyue abruptly talked again, “Did you cut your hair so short because I attacked you with lightning?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao immediately turned back, gazing at him through the sunglasses.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue felt being locked by her gaze. In the meantime, an invisible vibe spread in the car.</p> <p>Chen Yuting and Xiao Licheng, who was driving the car, instantly felt it hard to breathe.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue grinned as if nothing happened at all, saying, “Why are you nervous? Are you afraid that I might recognize you?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the other two, then turned around to look ahead while responding, “You think I’m nervous? That was just my natural reaction.”</p> <p>After saying that, she suddenly stuck her head out of the window to sniff around, then pulled her head back in and said to Xiao Licheng, “Hurry up… turn left five-hundred meters ahead.”</p> <p>About ten minutes later, they arrived at Region F, the region for refugees.</p> <p>At that moment, Shen Yujen’s chest was heaving very slightly in that dark room. A man was lying upon her, his hips moving constantly.</p> <p>A few men were squatting in a corner against the wall, chatting with surprise.</p> <p>“Eh, she’s at her last gasp for so long. This woman definitely doesn’t want to die.”</p> <p>“San, do it harder. Don’t get off her until she’s dead!”</p> <p>“Haha, yeah! You said that you want her last gasp. Look at you, you’ve been doing it for half an hour, yet she’s still alive.”</p> <p>Hearing them, another man joined the conversation, “Alright, don’t kill her yet. Let’s inject the zombie blood into her first, then let her die slowly.”</p> <p>At that point, the man on top of Shen Yujen suddenly began moving intensely. Then, he stopped abruptly and lay upon her, spending a short while to catch his breath. Then, he got up and put on his pants.</p> <p>“Ah, what a shame! She’s barely reacting…” The man said while wearing his belt. Then, the man who had asked his friend not to kill her walked to the bedside. In that dark room, the syringe needle in his hand shone with a gleam of light.</p> <p>It was half a tube of dark-red blood. No one knew where that man found the zombie blood.</p> <p>He bent over and picked up Shen Yujen’s arm which was covered in wounds and bruises, then pierced the needle into her skin and began injecting the zombie blood into her body. The injection of the blood didn’t cause any reaction in Shen Yujen, who was already like a dead body.</p> <p>After pulling out the needle, the man said to the others, “Get the bag.”</p> <p>They prepared to secretly send this woman to the research institute after the injection during her transformation.</p> <p>The virus required time to develop in the body of a living human being, so they still had some time to transport the woman to somewhere else.</p> <p>Right at that moment, a thunderous bang was heard. Following the sound, the door was suddenly kicked open.</p>",
  "Chapter 327: She’s still Breathing": "<p>Bang!</p> <p>The door was violently kicked open, then a hoarse voice could be heard.</p> <p>“You better not move, or I’ll cut your feet.”</p> <p>“Who are you!” The frightened people in the room shouted toward the outside. Then, they saw a weird person who was wearing a hat show up at the door. The voice they heard was dry and hoarse, so they couldn’t tell the gender of its owner. But now, the owner of the voice showed up in front of him. The light was coming from behind her, so they only saw a silhouette, and not her full breasts.</p> <p>They instantly figured out that the person who had broken into the room wasn’t friendly. Therefore, they all ignored Lin Qiao’s words and prepared to attack. However, right before they launched their powers, Lin Qiao suddenly spread her claws and swung he arm.</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>“Ahhh!.”</p> <p>After a series of flesh-cutting noise, loud and shrill screams could be heard. Then, those men thudded against the floor one after another.</p> <p>“Ou-Ouch… My Foot! My foot!”</p> <p>“Ah… Foot…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao slowly walked into the room which was filled with an indescribable smell, mixed with the strong scent of blood.</p> <p>As the door was wide open, the room became many times brighter than before, and everything in it was now clearly visible.</p> <p>At that point, quick footstep sounds were heard from the outside, then Chen Yuting came over ahead of the others.</p> <p>“Jen! Jen! J…” However, when he walked to the door and looked inside the room, he wasn’t able to let out even the slightest sound, as if someone had gripped his throat.</p> <p>He popped his eyes, looking at Shen Yujen with disbelief. She was lying flat on the bed, without any life-force.</p> <p>At that time, Wu Chengyue and his subordinates walked over. As he saw the scene in the room, his faint smile faded from his face. Then, he walked in expressionlessly.</p> <p>Chen Yuting walked to Shen Yujen dully, step by step, and Wu Chengyue followed behind him with a serious look.</p> <p>“She’s still breathing,” said Lin Qiao. She walked to the bedside and reached out a hand to touch Shen Yujen, then continued, “But, she seems to have been waiting to see you one last time.”</p> <p>Her words were like a bolt of lightning that struck Chen Yuting’s brain, freezing him and disabling him from reacting.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the few men whom each had a foot cut off by Lin Qiao had already passed out by now. Xiao Licheng brought some people in, then tied up those men and dragged them out.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took off her coat and covered Shen Yujen’s awfully wounded body with it. After that, she raised a hand, and a glass of clear water appeared in that hand.</p> <p>Seeing the water, Wu Chengyue’s eyes glowed. “Is this water from you? Or did you get it from Yuan Tianxing?” He stared at Lin Qiao and asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao forced Shen Yujen’s mouth open, then poured the glass of water in. Hearing Wu Chengyue’s question, she replied blandly, “Guess.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue watched her put the empty glass back into her space, then glanced at Shen Yujen. After that, he turned back to look at Lin Qiao, who was only wearing a military vest now.</p> <p>He saw her glowing-white arm and slim waist.</p> <p>Last time when he saw her in West Lake District, she was dressed like that as well. Her loose-fitting camouflage suit was in men’s style. Added with her height and short hair, she did look like a man.</p> <p>However, once she took off her coat, her hot body shape was exposed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Shen Yujen, then crossed her arms before her chest. By doing that, she accidentally squeezed her breasts and created a cleavage.</p> <p>She raised one hand to scratch her chin. Just now, she didn’t tell the others that this woman had already been infected by the zombie virus because she wasn’t sure if the lake water could erase the zombie virus from the bodies of living human beings. She only knew that the water was able to suppress the virus inside zombies’ bodies.</p> <p>So, she decided to give her the lake water before Chen Yuting and Wu Chengyue found out about the virus. The water would make her live longer anyway.</p> <p>Feeling that Wu Chengyue’s gaze was fixed on her, she lowered her head to glance at her own chest. Thankfully, she had found a suitable bra days ago, and was now wearing one of them. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have the courage to take off her coat just now. If the men in this room hadn’t been staring straight at the naked Shen Yuzhen, she wouldn’t take off her coat.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then decided to divert Wu Chengyue’s attention. “Can I ask you a question?” she said.</p> <p>“Me?” Wu Chengyue raised his head to look at her in the eyes, and she nodded. Wu Chengyue glanced at Chen Yuting who was holding Shen Yujen right now, then replied, “Can we save it till we get back? There’s a life to be saved.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was puzzled at first, then asked, “Can she still be saved?”</p> <p>Apart from her lake water, she didn’t know who or what else had the ability to save Shen Yuzhen who was in such a hopeless condition.</p> <p>“One person might be able to save her,” said Wu Chengyue. “Let’s head back and find Doctor Liang,” he then said to Chen Yuting.</p> <p>Chen Yuting carried Shen Yujen and followed Wu Chengyue out of the room. Lin Qiao was interested in Doctor Liang, so she silently followed them.</p> <p>The group of people quickly returned to Chen Yuting’s place. Chen Yuting carefully put Shen Yujen on the bed and covered her with a quilt, then gave the coat back to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>His beloved woman had suffered so much pain, but fortunately, he had found her. “Thank you for help me finding Jen,” he said to Lin Qiao sincerely.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took over the coat, then carelessly waved a hand at him and responded, “You’re welcome. I didn’t help you for free.” While speaking, she glanced at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue understood her meaning. “I get it,” he said. “I’ve already asked Licheng to gather the people that I’ve promised you. You’ll certainly see fifty extra people this afternoon. Don’t worry.”</p> <p>“Can I ask you that question now?” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at her with curiosity and said, “In return for letting you ask me that question, can I see your face without the sunglasses?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao stayed silent. Three seconds later, she raised a hand and took off her sunglasses without hesitation.</p> <p>Her face was pretty. However, once she opened her eyes, Chen Yuting gave a start and leaped backward.</p> <p>“You… You… Chief… She’s…” Chen Yuting pointed at Lin Qiao’s dark-green eyes and looked at Wu Chengyue alarmedly.</p> <p><em>‘Her face has been healed. She looks quite pretty now. But, I think I’ve seen this face somewhere before… Where </em>?’ Looking at Lin Qiao’s face, Wu Chengyue said to himself silently.</p> <p>“Have we met before?” he asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao calmly put the sunglasses back on, then said, “Answer my question first. The little one… She isn’t your biological daughter, is she?”</p> <p>Once she said that, Wu Chengyue fell into silence, and his smile disappeared. His face wore no expression, so Lin Qiao couldn’t guess what he was thinking. Standing beside them, Chen Yuting looked at Lin Qiao with surprise, then at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Right at this moment, a series of footstep sounds were heard from the outside. Soon, Meng Yue came in along with Doctor Liang and Moli. Wu Yueling was carried in her arms.</p>",
  "Chapter 328: Take Her And Come With Me": "<p>Seeing Doctor Liang, Chen Yuting immediately rushed up to him and said, “Doctor Liang, please save my wife! Please! You have to save her!”</p> <p>Liang Dashu said to him, “Calm down! Let me have a look first.” While speaking, he walked into the room and leaned against the bedside, then bent over to observe Shen Yujen’s skin color and lifted her eyelids to check her eyeballs.</p> <p>After that, he picked up her wrist to feel her pulse.</p> <p>A while later, he frowned slightly. As he prepared to drop her hand, he suddenly found a pinhole on her arm.</p> <p>He paused slightly, then the look on his face changed. Once again, he lifted her eyelids to carefully check her eyeballs, then pressed around the pinhole on her arm.</p> <p>As he put Shen Yujen’s hand back onto the bed and stood up, his face was showing a very grim look. He looked at Chen Yuting and gave a sigh.</p> <p>Hearing his sigh, Chen Yuting’s scalp was numbed, his eyes showing panic.</p> <p>“She was at her last gasp. After seeing you earlier, she has probably let out this last gasp already. Normally speaking, she should have stopped breathing by now. However, I’ve checked her and found that her body isn’t completely dead yet, but she has already lost her consciousness. In other words… her body is now protected by some kind of energy, but her brain activity has stopped,” Liang Dashu looked at Chen Yuting and said.</p> <p>Then, he turned to Wu Chengyue and asked, “Have you given her the same kind of water that Yuan Tianxing gave to Ling Ling earlier? The energy is the same as what I detected from Ling Ling’s body.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned to look at Lin Qiao while Chen Yuting was stupefied after hearing Liang Dashu’s words.</p> <p>He didn’t quite understand Liang Dashu’s meaning, but he knew that his Jen wouldn’t wake up, as the doctor said that she had already lost consciousness…</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue stayed silent, Doctor Liang turned to Lin Qiao who was standing aside, knowing that he had guessed right. However, he didn’t care much about that, but turned back to Chen Yuting and said, “In a better way, she’s in a vegetative state now. Only her body remains alive. Her brain is in suspended animation.</p> <p>He paused for a second, then looked at the others and continued, “There’s another thing. Someone has injected the zombie virus into her body not long ago. The virus has spread all over her blood, so judging by her current condition, she’ll definitely become a zombie.”</p> <p>Except for Lin Qiao, all the others turned to him with surprise after hearing that. Meng Yue automatically carried Wu Yueling to the other side of the room, which was relatively far from the bed.</p> <p>But soon, she and Wu Chengyue both turned their eyes to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Chen Yuting, who had gotten whacked for a couple of times, suddenly came back to his senses. He darted up to Lin Qiao and knelt before her. He lowered his head and said, “Miss. Lu… can you help me? Even… even if Jen turned into a zombie, I don’t want her to forget me! You know how to help her, don’t you? Because you’re a…”</p> <p>He raised his head to look at Lin Qiao pleadingly while finishing his words.</p> <p>The others all looked at Lin Qiao. Some of them were confused, some were thinking, and some had anticipation in their eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently looked at Chen Yuting for about ten seconds before responding to him, “You love her very much. Even if she turned into a zombie…”</p> <p>Chen Yuting wasn’t a handsome man, but he was a righteous person. It wasn’t hard to tell that he cared a lot about his wife. Lin Qiao clearly sensed his sadness and despair without even touching him. He had a genuine love for his wife.</p> <p>Looking at his begging eyes, Lin Qiao believed that he would satisfy any condition she named. He might even kill himself without hesitation if she asked him to.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “I can save her. But, I don’t know what the final result will be. I don’t know if she’ll remember you, or anything else. If I can make her remember you, you need to promise me one thing.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting’s eyes were so red that they seemed to even bleed. However, he nodded delightedly and said, “I’ll do whatever you say!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao said, “If I save her, you and her will have to join our new base.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting paused shortly upon hearing her words, then looked at her in shock, asking, “Is that it? No-nothing else?”</p> <p>He thought this Miss. Lu would ask him to do something for her, and he had already decided to do whatever she said, no matter how dangerous that would be. But to his surprise, her requirement was actually so simple. She only wanted him to move!</p> <p>Chen Yuting could scarcely believe her ears.</p> <p>Lin Qiao blandly nodded and said, “No, nothing else.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Chen Yuting hurriedly nodded and said, “We will! If you need more people, I’ll bring a few friends.”</p> <p>“That’s up to you,” Lin Qiao looked at him and replied.</p> <p>She asked him to bring his wife to the new base, not because the new base was short-handed, but for some other reason. If that woman really turned into a zombie with memories and sanity, she had to stay in the new base, because she wouldn’t be able to survive in this base.</p> <p>“She’s just worrying that your wife might not be able to survive here after becoming a zombie,” Wu Chengyue abruptly joined the conversation, “But in her base, she can at least protect her, right?”</p> <p>After saying that, he looked at Lin Qiao in a meaningful way, but she stayed silent.</p> <p>This man was worthy of being a Chief. He actually guessed out her thoughts.</p> <p>Only after hearing Wu Chengyue’s words did Chen Yuting understand why. He paused slightly, then looked at Lin Qiao and said gratefully, “Thank you! Thank you!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao waved a hand and said, “Don’t thank me yet. I haven’t saved her. Besides, it’s getting late. I am going to bring your wife into my space now. Don’t forget to go to the square this afternoon and join the others.”</p> <p>“Sure! I’ll do what you say!” Chen Yuting nodded, then stood up from the ground. But then, Wu Chengyue looked at Lin Qiao and said, “You stole my man just like that?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked back at him, then shrugged and replied, “That was his own choice.”</p> <p>At that point, Wu Yueling struggled out of Meng Yue’s arms as she felt that Lin Qiao was leaving.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, where’re you going?” Meng Yue looked at her with surprise. After that, she saw the little girl ran toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Having finished talking, Lin Qiao walked to the bed and touched Shen Yujen’s neck, then held her hands. Right after that, she suddenly felt some extra weight from one of her legs. And then, Shen Yujen, she, and Wu Yueling, who was hanging on her leg, disappeared together.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s heart broke as his daughter left with the zombie lady.</p> <p>Was he abandoned?</p> <p>He wasn’t her biological father, but had been raising her since she was born! His baby girl had abandoned him!</p>",
  "Chapter 329: Not Biological Father": "<p>Holding the naked Shen Yujen, Lin Qiao showed a weird expression while looking at the little girl who was hanging on her leg.</p> <p>“Daddy will be sad…” She said to the little girl with a smile.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao suddenly showed up with a woman carried in her arms, Liu Jun, Qiu Lili, and the others looked at her with curiosity. Then, they saw the little girl whose arms were around her leg.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>‘Little girl!’</p> <p>Among all the zombies who had seen Wu Yueling, Mengmeng was the most excited one. She fleetingly darted out of the woods toward Lin Qiao. The little one immediately hid behind Lin Qiao’s legs and stuck out half a head from behind her, looking at Mengmeng with a pair of sparkling eyes.</p> <p>“Don’t scare her!” Lin Qiao said to Mengmeng.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>‘I didn’t!’</p> <p>Seeing Wu Yueling hiding from her, Mengmeng wasn’t angry, and only disagreed with what Lin Qiao said.</p> <p>Suddenly, the surface of the lake rippled, and a few jade-white vines reached out of the water, toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Viney had woken up. Once she showed up, Mengmeng, who just ran up to Lin Qiao, forgot about Wu Yueling. She quickly turned to glance at Viney in the lake, then turned and ran toward the woods.</p> <p>“Viney is awake?” Lin Qiao looked at the vines and reached out a hand to catch them.</p> <p>Viney said to her happily, <em>‘Mama, Mama, Viney is hungry… Eh? Is this woman my food?” </em>While speaking to Lin Qiao, Viney pointed at Shen Yujen with her other vines.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “Be patient! She’s almost dead, with nothing but virus inside her body. You can’t eat her. Wait for a second, I’ll get you some zombie nuclei.”</p> <p><em>‘I can bring her back to life then, </em>‘ said Viney, <em>‘Mama, you can give me the nuclei. I can just use this human to filter my energy.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Bring her down first. I’ll go and get you the nuclei.”</p> <p>While speaking, she handed Shen Yujen to Viney. As Viney took her over, Lin Qiao bent to scoop up Wu Yueling, then turned and walked toward the second small space.</p> <p>She remembered that the bald robber had many zombie nuclei in her space.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao carried the little one there, those zombie leaders in the second small space all drooled at the little human girl. However, they didn’t dare to make any move without Lin Qiao’s permission.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the entrance, then said to the group of zombies, “Zombie number four, bring me the zombie nuclei in there. You didn’t eat them, did you?”</p> <p>The group of zombie shook their heads together.</p> <p>Zombie number four quickly ran to a corner and began searching. Soon, he came out holding a pile of sparkling zombie nuclei. Lin Qiao picked the level-four and five nuclei and left the rest for the zombies. “Alright, these are your snacks,” she said.</p> <p>The group of zombies didn’t know what ‘snacks’ meant, but did understand that Lin Qiao had given the remaining zombie nuclei to them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao carried the little one with one hand and the zombie nuclei with the other. Under the witnesses of the group of zombie leaders, she walked to the lake and threw the nuclei into the water.</p> <p>Following a series of plops, the zombie nuclei fell into the water, being swept away by a few jade white vines.</p> <p>“Who’s that?” Liu Jun and Qiu Lili walked to her and asked in one voice with curiosity.</p> <p>Lin Qiao answered their question, “A poor woman. She should be dead, but someone injected zombie blood into her body. She might wake up as a zombie.”</p> <p>“Why did you help her?” Qiu Lili asked.</p> <p>“I’m not helping her,” said Lin Qiao, “Her husband truly loves her. If she died, I’d feel sorry for the pair. After all, that man said that he won’t give up on her even if she becomes a zombie. I’d like to find out if that’s true or not.”</p> <p>“You do like to fulfill people’s wishes,” said Liu Jun.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spread her hands and said, “No, it’s like lifting a finger to me. Even if I refused to help him, I think that man would figure out a way to change my mind.”</p> <p>“That man?” Liu Jun and Qiu Lili looked at her with confusion, “That woman’s husband?”</p> <p>They thought that Lin Qiao was talking about the poor woman’s husband. However, Lin Qiao shook her head.</p> <p>“No, her father.” She lowered her head to glance at Wu Yueling and said. Hearing that, Liu Jun and Qiu Lili looked at her bewilderedly. Lin Qiao didn’t explain more to them, but continued, “Alright, I’ll bring her out. I can’t tell how much time it will take for that woman to transform into a zombie.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that moment, the people outside were glancing at each other.</p> <p>“Yue, I guess in the near future, Ling Ling will forget about her daddy.” Looking at the gray rabbit which was hopping around the room to search for Wu Yueling, Wu Chengyue silently nodded.</p> <p>“Chief?” Liang Dashu asked curiously, “Why did that weird woman ask you if Ling Ling is your biological daughter?”</p> <p>Meng Yue was looking at Wu Yueling and waiting for his answer as well. Ever since she met him, Wu Yueling had been with him. He told everyone that the girl was his daughter, so no one ever doubted if he was her biological father.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue sighed. Not many people were in the room at the moment. Except for Chen Yuting, Liang Dashu, and Moli, who had been silent the whole time, only he himself and the recently disappeared Miss. Lu were here.</p> <p>He said, “Ling Ling isn’t my biological daughter. She’s the daughter of a very good friend of mine. Not long after she was born, the apocalypse happened. My friend turned into a zombie. To protect the newly born baby, his wife dragged him and jumped down from over the tenth floor.”</p> <p>The others all fell in silence as they quietly looked at him.</p> <p>The smile on Wu Chengyue’s face showed a trace of hidden sadness as he continued, “When I found them, the baby was almost dying. I saved her and raised her as my own daughter.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao showed up at that moment, saying, “No wonder I felt that your blood isn’t the same as hers. It turns out that she isn’t your daughter, but is an adopted child.”</p> <p>Seeing her show up, Chen Yuting immediately rushed to her and asked, “How is it going? Will Jen… Will she wake up?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao put the little one on the ground while responding to him, “I don’t know yet. We need to wait to find out.”</p> <p>The others looked at Wu Chengyue with surprise, then turned to Wu Yueling, who was put on the ground and running toward Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>“Does… she know?” Meng Yue looked at Wu Chengyue and asked abruptly.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded and replied, “She does. I didn’t keep it secret from her.”</p> <p>“Don’t forget to leave with us this afternoon.” Lin Qiao said to Chen Yuting, then turned and walked out.</p> <p>Liang Dashu kept staring at Lin Qiao’s back. As she walked out of the room and went across the living room before leaving, he finally began asking questions.</p> <p>“Does she really know how to save that woman?”</p> <p>“Perhaps!” Wu Chengyue gave an uncertain answer, then said to Wu Yueling, who was on her way to the rabbit, “Ling Ling, we’re leaving.”</p>",
  "Chapter 330: The Furious Yang Yan": "<p>There was a fancy apartment building in Special Region B. This apartment was well equipped with excellent facilities, including seven solar energy storage facilities, which were enough to power the entire building. There was also a large pool on top of this building. Every day, water-powered people would go up there to add clear water into it.</p> <p>Moreover, this apartment building was newly constructed.</p> <p>At this point, in the luxurious apartment on the top floor of this building, Yang Yan was angrily pacing in the living room while emotionally yelling at an about thirty-years-old man, who was sitting on a couch, “Brother, why don’t you help me? I don’t care who they are and what’s their relationship with Wu Chengyue! They scared my boy, so I want them dead! Even if that can’t happen, I want them to each lose a hand or a leg.”</p> <p>The man sitting on the couch seemed to be at his thirties, but was actually over forty-years-old. He had a square face, thick brows, bright eyes, and a straight nose; he looked charming from every angle.</p> <p>His features looked forty percent similar to Yang Yan’s, but a lot gentler.</p> <p>A very young and pretty woman was softly leaning against him, as if she had no bones at all.</p> <p>“Ahyaya… Chao, why are you so afraid of Wu Chengyue? You can send the robber to bring them troubles. If they find anything, you can make the robber take all the blame, can’t you? What are you worrying about?” The pretty woman rubbed Yang Chao’s arm with her soft body while speaking with a sweet voice.</p> <p>Yang Chao gave her a glance, then turned back to her little sister. “Don’t you cause me any trouble at this point. If Wu Chengyue finds out about our plan because of what you did, I’ll punish you the first.”</p> <p>“But look at my boy! He’s been hiding under a blanket since yesterday! He won’t come out, and always pees in his pants! He’s your nephew! Are you gonna leave him like that?” Yang Yan shouted at Yang Chao.</p> <p>Yang Chao clicked his tongue, then said patiently, “Why did you encourage him to mess with those people? They gave him a lesson right on the spot. Wasn’t that enough?”</p> <p>Yang Yan paused briefly, then said resentfully, “I was just pretty pissed at that long-haired woman. Yang Hui liked her, and that should be a pleasure of hers. But, she just didn’t know what was good for him. So, I told my son to punish her and to take revenge for his uncle. What was wrong about that?”</p> <p>As Yang Yan finished talking, the pretty woman turned to Yang Chao and said, “Yan did what she did for Hui’s good. I don’t think she was wrong.”</p> <p>As the woman supported her, Yang Yan sounded even more confident, “Yun is absolutely right. Brother, just think of a way to make those people suffer. I can let the others live, but I want that tomboy with sunglasses to die first! We should better cut off all her limbs, then throw her to Region F for those dirty and stinky refugees to rape. I want them to rape her one after another until she dies!”</p> <p>“Shut up!” Yang Chao frowned slightly and said, “Who do you think she is? She’s someone who has the courage to start a fight in public. Can she be that easy to deal with? I’ve sent people to dig into her yesterday. That woman you talked about is traceless. My people failed to find anything about her. Also, Wu Chengyue is working together with them now. If we make any move before him, he will have a full reason to launch attacks at us.”</p> <p>“Ugh!” Hearing his words, Yang Yan screamed out loud with fury, then bent over and swept a teapot to the ground from the tea table, causing a loud noise.</p> <p>“We can’t do this, can’t do that! What you want me to do then? My boy is scared so badly. Don’t those people need to pay for what they did? What if it results in some kind of sequela? Who can bring justice to us?”</p> <p>Looking at his frenzied sister, Yang Chao put one hand on his forehead and said, “Alright, alright, calm down first! Your power isn’t stable. If it explodes, you’ll be the one who suffers. I’ll handle it. You should go back and keep an eye on your son now.”</p> <p>“No! I’m not going back!” The emotional Yang Yan shouted out loud without thinking.</p> <p>“Go back!” As she didn’t calm down and started getting unreasonable instead, Yang Chao had no choice but to yell at her. After being yelled at, Yang Yan paused, then reluctantly turned around and walked out.</p> <p>“You should go back as well,” Yang Chao then said to the woman beside him.</p> <p>“Alright!” The woman paused slightly, then obediently stood up. After taking a few steps, she turned around and asked, “Can I come back tonight?”</p> <p>“I’ll send someone to inform you,” Yang Chao said blandly.</p> <p>“Alright,” the woman turned and left unwillingly.</p> <p>Yang Chao glanced at his watch, then stood up and walked to the kitchen to boil a pot of water. After that, he took out some coffee powder which was very scarce in the post-apocalyptic world, and made himself a cup of instant coffee.</p> <p>He stirred the coffee with a fork, then held the cup as he walked to the balcony and stood there. Gazing afar, he drank the coffee sip by sip.</p> <p>Finishing the cup of coffee, he turned and came back inside. Right at that moment, the door was knocked on, and a soldier opened the door before walking in.</p> <p>“Chief, Mr. Tang is here.”</p> <p>Yang Chao nodded and said, “Let him in.”</p> <p>The soldier opened the door, then a man came in.</p> <p>Tang He walked in and watched the soldier close the door behind him, then walked to a couch in the living room.</p> <p>“Please have a seat. I’ll make you some coffee,” Yang Chao said to him, then walked back to the kitchen with the empty cup and made two cups of coffee, which he carried back out.</p> <p>Tang He looked at him and said, “Those people are leaving today. Lin Feng is a new level-six, and the other few team leaders are all at level-five. Yuan Tianxing isn’t going with them. Don’t they worry that something might happen on their way?”</p> <p>Yang Chao put a cup of coffee on the tea table before him and said, “No… You just haven’t seen the powerful ones who’re hiding behind them.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Tang He asked with surprise, “Powerful ones? Do you mean he has more supporters?”</p> <p>Yang Chao nodded and said, “There’s one who seems to be rather remarkable. I had sent out some people yesterday, but they failed to dig up her background.”</p> <p>“So… that person might leave with Lin Family?” Tang He asked. “If you don’t know about her background… will that affect what I’m going to do?”</p> <p>Yang Chao shook his head and responded, “No, but we will change the plan. You don’t need to go out of the base with them anymore. Instead, you’ll capture this woman in the base. I’ll handle the rest.”</p> <p>While speaking, he took out a photo and put it on the table, then pushed it to Tang He. The woman in the photo was Lin Wenwen, who had long and straight black hair.</p> <p>Tang He’s eyes glowed when he looked at the photo. He licked his lips as he stared at the photo and said, “This woman is pretty. Who is she?”</p> <p>“The youngest daughter of Lin Family,” said Yang Chao, “After capturing her, you can do anything you like to her. But, you have to hide her well… because I have a further plan.”</p>",
  "Chapter 331: Shen Yujen Became A Zombie": "<p>Yang Chao’s words sounded like he was going to give that woman to Tang He for him to have whatever fun he liked with her, as long as he captured her secretly. With surprise, Tang He looked at Yang Chao and said, “Eh? This woman is so pretty. Aren’t you gonna spend some great time with her yourself? Are you giving her to me?”</p> <p>“I can give her to you,” said Yang Chao, “But, you have to leave the girl with the katana to me. I think I need a change.”</p> <p>Tang He grinned wickedly and said, “Ah, so that’s the type you like now? Alright then!”</p> <p>Yang Chao glanced at him blandly, then said, “You should wait until Wu Chengyue has brought his army out of the base to collect supplies for the winter. And, you can’t kill that woman, neither should you keep her for too long. I’ll put the zombie virus into her body, then let her become a zombie in the base. After that, we’ll be able to control those people with the excuse that they carried the virus. By then, it would be too late for Wu Chengyue to come back and save them even if he wants to.”</p> <p>Tang He looked at him and laughed, “That’s such an evil plan, but I like it!”</p> <p>Yang Chao drank his cup of coffee, then continued confidently, “According to the message I just received, Wu Chengyue will gather his army and leave in a couple of days too. So, you should stay patient.”</p> <p>Tang He nodded and replied, “Alright. I won’t make any move until they’ve all left.”</p> <p>In the square, Lin Qiao returned to the gathering place, then looked at the time and found that it was noon already. Except for Wu Chengyue’s three-hundred and fifty people, the others had all gathered in the square. As Li Zheng came back, all the others looked at her curiously. “How did it go? Did you find her?” asked Li Zheng.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “We found her, but she isn’t in a very good condition.”</p> <p>“What happened?” Women’s curiosity made Mrs. Lin and Cheng Wangxue walk over.</p> <p>“She’s almost dead,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>About two o’clock in the afternoon, Xiao Yunlong and Chen Yuting each drove an off-road vehicle to the square. Following behind the two vehicles were a few modified FAW 141, mostly filled with soldiers.</p> <p>However, one FAW 141 was empty.</p> <p>Seeing the vehicles, Lin Qiao said to Lin Hao, “The vehicles are here. Count the noses and get abroad.”</p> <p>Li Hao turned around and yelled at the few others, “Li Zheng, count the noses and get onto that empty vehicle.” While speaking, he pointed at the empty FAW 141 at the back of the motorcade.</p> <p>Li Zheng and his teammates quickly gathered about twenty people behind them, then told them to get onto the vehicle.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t move, but casually glanced around. Quite some people had their eyes on her and her people, but she didn’t know whom they worked for.</p> <p>After everyone got aboard, the motorcade began moving toward an entrance of the base.</p> <p>In a corner of the square, Xie Dong silently watched the motorcade leave, then walked toward the administration building nearby. Lin Wenwen stayed in the base. Although Yuan Tianxing and Long Qingying were with her, it was still hard to avoid all possible dangers. Therefore, Lin Wenwen had left Xie Dong in the base.</p> <p>As long as he stayed silent, no one would find out about his true nature.</p> <p>He had regained his power, and stepped into level-four. Although his level wasn’t high, as a zombie, he was sensitive to all the movements that the others made. Therefore, he should be able to protect Lin Wenwen secretly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked toward a corner that no one was paying attention to, then disappeared.</p> <p>No one could sense her movements; not even Xiao Yunlong and Lin Feng were able to track her. She would always show up whenever and wherever she was needed.</p> <p>When the motorcade was miles away from the base, Lin Qiao showed up on the roof of the last vehicle. She silently followed behind the motorcade, as she had given the map to Lin Feng and told him about the location of the destination.</p> <p>At this time in her space, Liu Jun was sitting on a couch, watching Tongtong play with a grass plane that Lin Qiao made for him. Qiu Lili was lazily lying on another couch, fiddling with her long hair.</p> <p>All of a sudden, a wave of energy came from the lake, then a woman slowly walked out of the water. She was naked, shambling all the way. Her head was lowered, and her long wet hair covered her entire face.</p> <p>“She’s up,” Qiu Lili immediately sat up from the couch, then leaned her head forward to sniff at the woman. After that, she said, “She has become a zombie, but her scent is a little weird. She isn’t like a normal zombie.”</p> <p>Liu Jun thought for a moment, then said, “Her scent is the same as Xie Dong’s.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili’s eyes glowed when she heard that. “Ah, yeah, they’re the same!”</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao suddenly showed up by the lakeside, watching the woman come out. Liu Jun stood up and walked to Qiu Lili’s large closet, then found a shirt and a pair of pants.</p> <p>By now, Qiu Lili’s large closet didn’t only contain the clothes that Qiu Lili collected before, but also had many other clothes that Lin Qiao put in it.</p> <p>A few more closets were places around the original one.</p> <p>Liu Jun walked up behind Lin Qiao with the clothes and watched the woman who looked like a female ghost come out of the lake. She staggered to Lin Qiao, then stopped, her head remaining lowered, constantly dripping water. No life-force could be detected from her.</p> <p>“Raise your head,” said Lin Qiao to her.</p> <p>Shen Yujen slowly lifted her head and looked at Lin Qiao dully and confusedly. Her unfocused eyes were seen through the gaps between her hair locks.</p> <p>Sensing her vibe, Lin Qiao learned that she was exactly the same kind of zombie as Xie Dong, and was also mysteriously connected with herself. That unexplainable connection might be the reason why Shen Yujen automatically walked to her once she came out of the lake.</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s voice, Shen Yujen paused slightly, as if falling into deep thoughts. Gradually, her eyes brightened, showing hatred, anger, despair, love, surprise and all sorts of complicated and constantly changing feelings.</p> <p>Her eyes were the same as Xie Dong’s; the white parts of those eyes remained. Her appearance didn’t change much, as she didn’t have black zombie eyes or periorbital dark circles. Except for her pale skin, she looked no different from healthy human beings.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao knew that she couldn’t talk anymore.</p> <p>As she thought, Shen Yujen opened her mouth to try to say something, but quickly stopped, her eyes showing confusion.</p> <p>“Roar…”</p> <p>‘I…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Alright, I get it. You still have your memories, and that’s good enough. At least I did what I promised Chen Yuting.”</p> <p>Hearing her mentioning Chen Yuting, Shen Yujen showed tenderness in her eyes. She nodded and thought for a moment, then opened her mouth again.</p> <p>“Roar…”</p> <p>‘Thank you!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “You don’t need to thank me. What I did was conditional. From now on, you and Chen Yuting will have to leave Sea City Base and follow me.”</p> <p>Liu Jun handed the clothes to Shen Yujen, then said, “Have you found out what you are now?”</p> <p>Shen Yujen saw Liu Jun’s eyes while taking over the clothes. She was puzzled slightly, but didn’t pay too much attention to those eyes. After hearing Liu Jun’s question, she stopped dressing herself and nodded.</p>",
  "Chapter 332: I’m Willing to Wait for Him": "<p>Shen Yujen remembered what had happened to her. Before the rescue arrived, she was nearly unconscious. However, when Chen Yuting and the others found her, she had woken up for a while and heard some of Doctor Liang’s words.</p> <p>She remembered the doctor say that she was infected by the zombie virus.</p> <p>She wasn’t able to talk now, and her limbs were stiff. That made her feel that she was no longer alive.</p> <p>She raised a hand and pressed it on her heart. As she expected, her heart wasn’t beating.</p> <p>“Put on the clothes first,” said Lin Qiao, “Chen Yuting is right outside. If you want to see him, I’ll bring you out.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Shen Yujen quickly shook her head, as if she didn’t want to see Chen Yuting ever again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew what she was thinking. “Your appearance didn’t change,” she said to her, “You look exactly the same as before. Do you still not want to see him? If he loves you, he won’t mind your change.”</p> <p>Shen Yujen lowered her head and quietly got dressed.</p> <p>“Alright then,” Lin Qiao continued, “If you don’t want to see him, you can stay here for now and get used to your current state.”</p> <p>Shen Yujen dressed herself and raised her head to look at Lin Qiao, then at Liu Jun. After that, she turned her head to look around. Abruptly, she paused, then raised her nose to sniff at the couch area. Afterward, her eyes were fixed on Tong Tong, who was on a couch.</p> <p>Liu Jun discovered the gradually appearing hunger in her eyes, so she said to her, “That’s my son. You can’t eat him. If you’re really hungry, go drink from the lake. The lake water will ease your hunger.”</p> <p>Shen Yujen was puzzled at first, then turned to look at the lake with surprise. As she had no more questions, Lin Qiao turned around and prepared to exit her space.</p> <p>“Roar…”</p> <p>‘Wait!’</p> <p>Sensing that Lin Qiao was leaving, Shen Yujen suddenly told her to wait.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned back, looked at her and asked, “What’s wrong?”</p> <p>“Roar…”</p> <p>‘Can I go out?’</p> <p>Shen Yujen looked at her and asked.</p> <p>“Do you want to take revenge?” Lin Qiao responded.</p> <p>She first crossed her arms before her chest, then put a hand on her chin and said, “Those people haven’t died yet, even though I’ve cut a foot each of theirs. However, Wu Chengyue has them now. I think he’s going to use them to bring troubles to Yang Chao. Em… If you want to go back and kill them, I don’t think Wu Chengyue will let you do it now.”</p> <p>“Roar…” Shen Yujen shook her head and said. ‘Not them!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her and blinked while continuing, “Are you talking about the man who planned this? Isn’t that Yang Chao’s little brother, or one of his subordinates?”</p> <p>She knew about Yang Chao’s brother, Yang Hui, was one of his right-hand men, the one who fought Chen Yuting the other day. That man always liked to rape women secretly, then kill those poor women and destroy the bodies.</p> <p>Shen Yujen slightly lowered her head; her vibe a little agitated.</p> <p>“Roar…” ‘I’ll tear him into pieces myself!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her and stayed silent for a while.</p> <p>Liu Jun, who stood beside her, didn’t know what Shen Yujen had been through. However, judging by her unstable emotions, she could guess that something awful and unfair must have happened to her.</p> <p>“Does she want to go back to take revenge? Is the enemy in a high position in Sea City Base?” asked Liu Jun.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “The relationship between her husband and Wu Chengyue is a little sensitive. That’s why Wu Chengyue’s opponent hurt her. He did that mainly to frustrate her husband and Wu Chengyue.”</p> <p>Thinking about what could happen to a woman who fell into the hands of some high-positioned but sick men in a base, Liu Jun didn’t say anything but silently glanced at Shen Yujen.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment, then said to Shen Yujen, “Your condition isn’t stable yet, and you haven’t gotten familiar with your new body. Besides, even if I sent you out now, you wouldn’t be able to enter the base. How about this? I’ll bring you into the base when I go back next time. Don’t worry, I won’t make you wait too long.”</p> <p>As Lin Qiao promised to bring her back, Shen Yujen nodded.</p> <p>As no other zombies on the scene disagreed with what Lin Qiao said, she silently sighed with relief.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the base, Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying stood by a window in the Mission Hall, watching the motorcade leave.</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at Lin Wenwen and said with disagreement, “You should go with them. Even if Deputy Chief does need help, your little brother could stay. It’s too dangerous for you to be here.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen shook her head and said, “I’m not afraid of dangers. Tianxing is here. He won’t let anything happen to me.”</p> <p>When Lin Wenwen said Yuan Tianxing’s name, a trace of affection flashed across her eyes and soon disappeared. However, Long Qingying still managed to see that. “You should know clearly enough that Deputy Chief is in love with someone. Is it worth for you to wait like this?”.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen turned to glance at Yuan Tianxing and a few others who were at a distance away, then looked at Long Qingying and responded with a smile, “Maybe he’ll forget about my sister one day and notice me, who has been by his side the whole time. It’s worth for me to wait, even if I have to wait until I die.”</p> <p>Long Qingying sighed, but didn’t say anything else. Lin Wenwen was in love with Yuan Tianxing, while Yuan Tianxing was in love with her elder sister. She wasn’t able to walk into his heart, but refused to give up.</p> <p>The leader of the Hades Base had already died. Perhaps, this provided Lin Wenwen with a chance, even though she had never thought that her sister would die.</p> <p>So now, Lin Wenwen would try to get closer to Yuan Tianxing once she got a chance.</p> <p>On the other side of the base, in Wu Chengyue’s small building which was located in Special Region A, Wu Yueling was chasing behind the gray rabbit in the empty living room, seeming to be having fun. The rabbit was like a gray ball hopping on the floor. Anyway, it never hopped far away, and stayed around Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng came in with a sealed box and said to Wu Chengyue, who was sitting on a couch and reading files, “I found them.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue raised his head and saw the box in his hands before nodding. “Send it to Yuan Tianxing,” he said, “We’ll be leaving tomorrow, so when she gets back, we won’t be here. Just tell Yuan Tianxing to give them to her.”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng nodded, then turned and left. Soon, he found Yuan Tianxing in the Mission Hall.</p> <p>“Deputy Chief Yuan,” he walked over and grinned as he greeted Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing turned back. Seeing him, he smiled and responded, “Licheng, don’t call me Deputy Chief. I’m not a Deputy Chief anymore. Just call me Mr. Yuan.”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng nodded and smiled, “Alright, Mr. Yuan…”</p> <p>Then, he took out the box and handed it to Yuan Tianxing, “My Chief wants you to give this to Miss. Lu, the one with sunglasses, please.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing, Lin Wenwen, and Long Qingying all curiously looked at the box in his hands.</p> <p>“What’s in it?”</p> <p>“Cosmetic contacts,” said Xiao Licheng.</p> <p>“Ah…” Hearing that, the others all nodded knowingly.</p>",
  "Chapter 333: Arriving at the Upper City District": "<p>At about four or five pm, the motorcade entered the center of Hangzhou City.</p> <p>“This… Are we heading to the zombie city Hangzhou?” The people who had applied for the job by themselves were a little panicked. Seeing more and more zombies around, these people all showed fear in their eyes, especially those commoners.</p> <p>“We… We don’t want to go! We don’t want to go!… We want to go back! You lied, like everyone else said! Did you bring us here to use us as baits?”</p> <p>“He’s right! We won’t go there with you!”</p> <p>Chen Yuting’s teammates didn’t shout loud along with them, but they had panicked as well. Only a few of them stayed fearless.</p> <p>“Hah, calm down… These are nothing but zombies. If a zombie attacked you, you only need to smash its head. If two zombies attacked you, you’ll just have to smash their heads too. This is better than being starved in the base.” A muffled voice was heard.</p> <p>People turned to the source of the voice and saw a man who was at least six feet and three inches tall. He had bushy eyebrows and large eyes, square face and a Roman nose. His hair were in a flat top which wasn’t flat at all. Clearly, that hair weren’t cut by a professional barber.</p> <p>The others stared at him and one of them said loudly, “You… You have a superpower! Of course, you’re not afraid of zombies! You can pick up any mission in the base, and then you’ll have food to eat. Will you ever be starved?”</p> <p>The tall man shook his head and responded honestly, “Ugh… The money I earned from missions was never enough for me to feed myself… I didn’t dare to come out alone, but the others wouldn’t team up with me.”</p> <p>At that point, a bland voice joined the conversation, “Why are you so nervous? Look carefully, those zombies don’t dare to approach us. Haven’t you realized that?”</p> <p>The others turned to where that voice came from and saw a young man wearing an old pair of square glasses, sitting aside with his arms crossed before his chest. He was observing the road through his glasses. After he said what he did, he raised his head to glance at Lin Yu and his teammates who were quiet the whole time, then turned his eyes away.</p> <p>After hearing his words, the others all calmed down a little and also looked outside the window, as though they were influenced by this young man’s composure. While observing, they found that the zombies on the road didn’t bare their teeth or spread their claws to crazily charge at the motorcade, but all paused briefly after spotting the vehicles, then turned and quickly ran away.</p> <p>“Eh? Ugh? It’s real! They all ran away! Why?” the tall man looked around with surprise.</p> <p>“Look this way, these zombies ran away as well!”</p> <p>“No wonder the journey has been so peaceful so far. We haven’t encountered any zombies yet.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao, who sat in the front, glanced at the people back there, then turned around.</p> <p>At the front, Lin Feng and Chen Yuting arrived at the government building in the Upper City District after half an hour of driving according to Lin Qiao’s map. They did spend a long time to get to this place because the roads were all jammed. Their vehicle was too large to drive through the narrow roads, so they had no choice but to get off the car and push away all the abandoned vehicles on the road, then drive through.</p> <p>Therefore, they spent a great effort to drive to the government building. Thankfully, their vehicle was loaded with people. In the jammed sections, they sent some soldiers to clear the way, or directly used their powers to do that.</p> <p>However, this place wasn’t their destination; it was the Victoria Hotel, which was further away. They were only passing by this area.</p> <p>Before arriving at the hotel, Lin Qiao suddenly stood up and leaped out. She leaped on the vehicle at the front, then continued leaping forward until she landed before Lin Feng’s vehicle.</p> <p>“Wait here!” Lin Qiao stopped the vehicle in the middle of the road and said to the people in it, then turned and walked toward the hotel which was by the roadside.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong stuck his head out of the window and said, “What is she doing?”</p> <p>Chen Yuting shook his head.</p> <p>“Um… Clear away zombies?” Lin Feng speculated.</p> <p>The others looked at him, wondering why Lin Qiao would clear away the zombies alone. Wouldn’t more people complete the work faster?</p> <p>“In fact, the zombies nearby have mostly escaped,” Lin Feng continued, “I guess she’s just going to drive out the ones which are still hiding in the hotel. Think about who she is. Once she releases her vibe, those zombies would run away. She doesn’t even need to do anything else.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong and Chen Yuting nodded. They had actually remembered what Miss. Lu was right after they had asked that question without hesitation.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked into the hotel. The hotel building wasn’t tall, but was quite large, with over two-hundred rooms, and was quite nicely decorated. Once the solar power equipment was connected with the power supply of this building, this place would be good enough for people to live in.</p> <p>In front of the hotel was a commercial plaza. The geographic location of this place was not bad.</p> <p>This place was crowded with zombies before. However, after sensing the arrival of Lin Qiao’s motorcade, they all fled as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Lin Qiao entered the hotel building and walked around in it. When she was doing that, the people outside saw a few zombies jump down from the windows of some hotel rooms.</p> <p>About ten minutes later, they saw Lin Qiao walk out.</p> <p>She stood on the broad road before the hotel and waved at the others, “All clear, get off!”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong and the others drove the vehicles over, then all the soldiers got off.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao said to Xiao Yunlong, Lin Feng, and Chen Yuting, who had walked up to her, “We’ll be staying in this hotel before the construction work is done. There are over two-hundred rooms, which should be enough to accommodate all our people. Any different thoughts?”</p> <p>The three shook their heads. She was the one who chose this place, so they had no reason to disagree with her even if they wanted to. After all, she was the one who secured the absolute safety.</p> <p>What if she decided to turn and leave if they didn’t agree with her? Once she left, the zombie crowd nearby would become a true nightmare. Those were tens of millions of zombies. Even if those zombies did not kill them directly, they would make them die from exhaustion.</p> <p>As no one objected, Lin Qiao nodded and continued, “There’s another thing… Leave all the top-floor rooms for us. Tell the others to not go up there. You know why.”</p> <p>The three glanced at each other, then nodded knowingly.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao turned around and abruptly hopped onto a treetop, then directly leaped onto the roof of the hotel building. Lin Feng and the other two turned back to gather their people, then led them into the lobby of the hotel.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood on the roof and flashed into her space, preparing to send Qiu Lili and Mengmeng out. However, right after she steadied herself, her body was coiled by a few jade-white vines.</p> <p>Viney seemed to have been waiting for her. <em>‘Mama, Mama, Viney wants to upgrade… Please find me large energy nuclei…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with surprise, saying, “Eh? Didn’t I just give you a bunch of level four and five zombie nuclei? Weren’t those enough?”</p> <p>Viney responded with discontentment, <em>‘No, those were far from enough… And I’ve given the energy to the new girl…’</em></p> <p>While speaking, Viney pulled out a vine and pointed at Shen Yujen.</p> <p>Liu Jun glanced at Shen Yujen, seeing that she was sitting in front of Liu Jun and Qiu Lili, looking a little overcautious. It seemed that she didn’t dare to move without permission.</p> <p>It was probably because she had been completely suppressed by Qiu Lili’s vibe, as the latter was too close to her.</p>",
  "Chapter 334: She Asked to Stay": "<p>Lin Qiao turned back to say to Viney, “Alright, I’ll go out and try to catch you a big zombie, or find you some nuclei of mutant plants.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Viney happily responded, <em>‘Alright, alright, Mama, help me upgrade quickly… I want to go out, go out!’</em></p> <p>“Do you want to go out?” Lin Qiao asked her with surprise.</p> <p>Viney waved her vines and said, <em>‘Yes, yes </em>!’</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded. It seemed that Viney had gotten bored in here.</p> <p>“Alright, after I have finished my job here, I’ll take you to find energy nuclei,” she said.</p> <p><em>‘Great, great </em>!’ Viney excitedly swayed her vines.</p> <p>Lin Qiao asked Viney to unwrap her, then walked to Qiu Lili and said, “We have arrived at our destination. Let’s go out to arrange the works, and also choose your rooms.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili and Liu Jun quickly stood up. Seeing that Lin Qiao was going to send them out, Mengmeng, who had been hiding in the woods, ran out as well. Lin Qiao sent the three of them out first, then returned to bring out zombie one to seven.</p> <p>In the end, only Shen Yujen was left in the space.</p> <p>On the roof, Lin Qiao said to the group of zombies, “I’ve told the others that the roof and the top-floor is our territory. You can pick your own rooms, but shouldn’t go down to the other floors unless you have permission from Lili or me. Do you understand?”</p> <p>After saying that to zombie one to seven, she stared at Mengmeng, who had sneaked to the edge of the roof and was now looking down, and continued, “And you, get back here and listen to me carefully.”</p> <p>Mengmeng was leaning against the guardrail, curiously observing the area around the hotel building. As she finished observing this side and was prepared to go to the other side, she heard Lin Qiao call her name.</p> <p>“Roar…” She reluctantly walked to Lin Qiao. ‘Alright.’</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao said to Qiu Lili, “After I leave, you and Mengmeng can’t leave this area together. A high-level one should always stay here… Do you understand?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili nodded and said, “I understand. I’ll go downstairs to pick my room then.” While speaking, she turned and went down, her long twin-tails fluttering in the air. Liu Jun carried Tongtong and silently went down as well as she wasn’t needed here.</p> <p>“Now, you need to memorize the scents of the human beings in this building, then drive all the zombies around to two miles away. After that, you need to gather them up and block all the entrances. This place is your territory, so you need to guard it. Do you understand?” she said to the eight zombies.</p> <p>“Roar…” The group of zombie leaders replied. ‘Understood.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao then continued, “Kill all zombies above level-three and give me their nuclei. If you can’t defeat the enemies alone, don’t forget to ask the nearest friend to help. You’re a team now, and you should learn to help each other. Do you understand?”</p> <p>“Roar…” The group of zombie leaders who were all used to taking actions alone responded to that unwillingly. ‘Alright…’</p> <p>“Move,” Lin Qiao waved a hand at them and said. With that, the five zombie leaders and two superpowered zombies leaped off the roof in seven different directions, soon disappearing from Lin Qiao’s sight.</p> <p>Only Mengmeng stayed on the roof, looking around.</p> <p>“Get down to pick your room,” Lin Qiao said and guided her down through the stairs. They followed Qiu Lili’s scent to a room. After walking in, they saw Qiu Lili standing in the middle of the room, waving her arms to gather the dust in the room into a sphere with her wind power.</p> <p>Liu Jun wasn’t here, but Lin Qiao knew that she and Tong Tong were in the room next door.</p> <p>After Qiu Lili had sent the dust out of the window and created a gust of wind to blow it away, she turned back to find Mengmeng rolling on the bed she liked.</p> <p>“Ah! That bed is mine! You got your scent on it! Get off!” Seeing Mengmeng’s movements, Qiu Lili immediately burst in screams. She flipped her long twin-tails and rushed to the bed, violently kicking Mengmeng away.</p> <p>Mengmeng swiftly rolled off the bed, then stuck her head out from behind the bed and roared, “Roar… roar…”</p> <p>‘I want to share a room with you!’</p> <p>Qiu Lili strongly refused. She popped her eyes and said, “Why share a room with me? There’s only one bed here. Go to another room.”</p> <p>However, Mengmeng quickly crawled under the bed.</p> <p>“Roar…”</p> <p>‘No.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them; clearly, Mengmeng wanted to stay around Qiu Lili.</p> <p>“‘I’ll be leaving here for Sea City Base soon, also to find energy nuclei for Viney on my way back. You keep an eye on this place. Don’t let strangers come mess around,” Lin Qiao stood before the door and said, then turned and prepared to leave.</p> <p>Qiu Lili was bending over to drag Mengmeng out from under the bed. Hearing Lin Qiao’s words, she straightened her body.</p> <p>“Eh? For Viney? Is she upgrading again?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the door while replying, “It seems that she really wants to come out.” After saying that, she left the room.</p> <p>She turned and walked into Liu Jun’s room, which was next to Qiu Lili’s. Liu Jun put Tong Tong on the empty place before the door while she was cleaning the dust and garbage in the room.</p> <p>“I’m heading back to Sea City Base now. If you and Tong Tong need any help, go find Lili,” Lin Qiao said to her.</p> <p>Liu Jun stopped turning the old quilt on the bed, then stood straight and asked Lin Qiao, “Is Viney trying to get out? She’s bored in there, isn’t she?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao leaned against the door frame and nodded, “Perhaps.”</p> <p>“I get it,” Liu Jun nodded and responded. After that, she looked at Lin Qiao as if she had suddenly thought of something, and asked, “Also, I want to know why you left Wenwen in Sea City Base. Too many people are in the base, good and evil. What if she encounters any trouble? You aren’t there at the moment.”</p> <p>“I didn’t leave her there,” said Lin Qiao, “She insisted on staying. She didn’t want to come with me, and I can’t make her, can I? I respect her decision. Besides, Yuan Tianxing is there too, isn’t he? He won’t let anything happen to her.”</p> <p>She had recently noticed the way Lin Wenwen looked at Yuan Tianxing. Making those two a couple didn’t seem to be a bad thing at all. Lin Qiao believed that letting her little sister be together with one of her previous subordinates, whom she knew very well, was way better than handling her to one of the other men that she didn’t know. After all, men could be very dangerous in the post-apocalyptic era.</p> <p>Liu Jun shook her head and said with concern, “I doubt that. The situation in that base has already started to become unstable. If someone has his eyes on Wenwen, not even Deputy Chief Yuan can guarantee her safety.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao blinked, then said, “Don’t worry! Wu Chengyue is still in that base during these couple of days, so those people won’t dare to make any move. Besides, I did plan to go back straight after arriving at this place. It’s only about two hours of driving, so even if I spend half an hour on my way to find an energy nucleus for Viney, I’ll be back in Sea City Base by tomorrow. They can’t do anything serious within such a short time. Xiao Yunlong and the others will leave later.”</p> <p>Liu Jun thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “You’re right though. It’s only one night. I believe those people won’t take action so soon.”</p>",
  "Chapter 335: A Dog Fights A Tree": "<p>Liu Jun came out of Liu Jun’s room and walked downstairs. In the lobby, she saw that Lin Feng and the others had already cleaned all the couches there. Those couches were still not very clean, but were tidy enough for people to sit on. After all, most of the people had lowered their hygiene standards since the apocalypse arrived.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over and said, “Have you done some arrangement yet? I won’t take part in the construction of the fence wall, so it won’t start until Yuan Tianxing arrives. I’m heading back to the base now. I have something else to do on my way, so I won’t leave together with you. Deputy Chief Xiao, you guys are free to leave whenever you feel like.”</p> <p>Lin Feng, Xiao Yunlong, and Chen Yuting all looked at her with surprise. “You’re leaving already? So soon? Alone?” asked Lin Feng.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood in front them with her hands resting in her pockets as she nodded and responded, “Don’t worry, I’ve sent out my zombie squad to drive away the zombies nearby. I’ve also strictly ordered them to guard around the building. Qiu Lili and Liu Jun will both stay here. Only I will leave.”</p> <p>Hearing her say that Qiu Lili would stay, the three who were sitting on a couch sighed in relief.</p> <p>“Alright then,” said Lin Feng.</p> <p>Chen Yuting anxiously looked at her and said, “How is Jen…”</p> <p>“She hasn’t woken up yet,” said Lin Qiao, “I’ll give her back to you when she wakes up. Don’t worry, she’ll be fine.” She respected Shen Yujen’s decision, and didn’t tell Chen Yuting about her current condition.</p> <p>Chen Yuting dropped his eyes with a slight disappointment, but still nodded gratefully, “Alright!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned and walked out of the Hotel gate. Standing outside, she waved a hand and then an unmodified off-road vehicle appeared on the road.</p> <p>She was so rich now that she almost had whatever she wanted. She hadn’t only put furniture pieces, daily supplies, clothes, and shoes in her space, but had also collected many drivable vehicles, larges ones and small ones. Her collection even included a few electric vehicles and fuel-efficient cars.</p> <p>She sat onto the driver’s seat, then started the car and began driving back. She drove out of the Upper City District and moved toward Jiaxing City. While driving, she had been paying attention to all kinds of scents that she sensed, and the noises that she heard on the way.</p> <p>Only after arriving at Nanhu did she sense a very powerful level-five zombie which was only a breath away from level-six. She immediately turned the car back as she restrained her vibe and drove toward that area. Soon, she found a botanical garden.</p> <p>Was that zombie in the botanical garden?</p> <p>She pooled over, then got off the car and put it back into her space. She observed the botanical garden which had already become like a wild jungle, then spent a while to finally find the entrance. After that, she turned herself invisible and walked in.</p> <p>The botanical garden was huge; all the pathways in it were mostly covered by thriving plants.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t sense the vibes of these mutant plants. If the mutant plants restrained their vibes intentionally, not even Lin Qiao could sense them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao moved toward the level-five zombie. Meanwhile, she had also been carefully observing the plants nearby. A high-level mutant plant might also have an energy nucleus.</p> <p>When she thought that she probably wouldn’t find a high-level mutant plant so easily, a loud noise was heard from the front.</p> <p>The trees here were all tall, so she couldn’t find the tallest tree. Therefore, she gave up on climbing on top of the tallest tree to observe the environment. Instead, she quickly but quietly headed toward the source of the noise.</p> <p>“Roar!” Suddenly, she heard waves of beast roars, and felt a little strange. It sounded like a beast, but not a normal beast.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao sneakily got closer and saw that creature clearly, she understood why it sounded like a beast but not like a normal beast.</p> <p>That was a zombie beast!</p> <p>It was as large as a male lion. The locks of fur from its neck to its back were long, and were standing straight. Its whole body was covered in wounds and blood, its dark eyes glowing with the light of ferocity and its sharp teeth bared.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>It was a giant zombie dog, with dense fur and a scary-looking face. It was even stronger than a male lion, but its skin was badly mutilated. From time to time, some thick and black liquid would drip out of its wounds, making it look very creepy.</p> <p>It was like a hellhound!</p> <p>Lin Qiao silently stared at this large zombie dog. Suddenly, she had urge to tame it and make it follow her orders like a military dog…</p> <p>But soon, she stopped thinking about that, as she was attracted by the zombie dog’s enemy.</p> <p>It was what she was looking for but had a hard time finding–a mutant tree!</p> <p>The tree looked quite weird. The tree trunk was extra thick—a meter and half in diameter—very smooth and with no bark on it. It was dark-red in color, covered in interweaving blood vines.</p> <p>There was a groove where the tree trunk forked, and that groove had been emitting an awful stench. Lin Qiao was able to sense it from a long distance away.</p> <p>That was like the smell of a rotten corpse.</p> <p>The countless leafless branches of that tree had been dancing in the air. In fact, the entire tree had been writhing the whole time. Those long and thick branches looked like waving monster tentacles.</p> <p>The area that the tree could reach with its branches was empty</p> <p>This tree had an immense vibe, which was even stronger than that of the vine plant which Lin Qiao found by a lake last time.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao observed for a while but failed to locate its energy nuclei.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie dog stood by the edge of the empty area where the tree couldn’t reach, slightly bending its limbs and growling at the tree. Suddenly, it sprung up and charged at the tree trunk. It turned into a black shred of shadow as it flashed across the air like a bolt of lightning.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that the dog was fast enough, but the tree reacted even faster. Before the zombie dog touched the tree trunk, all the branches suddenly gathered before it and wrapped up the trunk while a fraction of those branches swept toward the dark shred of shadow.</p> <p>Seeing that its attack had become ineffective, the zombie dog hurriedly turned and leaped away to dodge the branches. However, it didn’t give up just like that. Instead, it darted up behind the tree and charged again.</p> <p>This time, the tree didn’t swing its branches backward, but suddenly bent its trunk, as if moving away from the zombie dog. At this moment, the dog was right above it.</p> <p><em>‘This isn’t good!’</em></p> <p>Watching that, Lin Qiao knew that the zombie dog was going to suffer.</p> <p>As she had thought, the deeply bent tree suddenly bounced back up, and all the branches stuck together within a blink, becoming like a very strong broom that slapped the zombie dog away.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie dog gave a howl, then heavily thudded against the ground.</p>",
  "Chapter 336: The Zombie Dog Loses": "<p>Soon, the zombie dog stood up from the ground, not seeming to have been harmed at all. It shook the dirt off its fir, then continued growling at the tree.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Abruptly, it widely opened its jaws toward the trees and bared its white and sharp teeth. Lin Qiao sensed waves of energy from its body. Before long, a stream of energy gushed out of its mouth.</p> <p>“Roar!” It let out a thunderous roar toward the tree, following which, a purple-red flake of fire burst from its mouth, toward the tree. The tree flinched once the purple-red fire showed up. It bent backward as far as possible to dodge the fire.</p> <p>A wave of energy was released from the groove on the tree trunk, as if the tree was trying to protect itself from the fire.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched the level-five zombie dog release the raging fire to burn the curled leafless tree.</p> <p>The zombie dog was powerful. It kept releasing fire from its mouth for two or three minutes before stopping.</p> <p>Lin Qiao could sense the incredibly high temperature of that fire. The plants nearby which weren’t burned by the fire had all quickly withered.</p> <p>The zombie dog kept its fire under a good control, so it only burned the tree and not the other plants. However, the plants nearby were still dried by the fire.</p> <p>Lin Qiao automatically stepped backward. She had to, because it was too hot!</p> <p>An ordinary tree would have turned into a puff of smoke after being burned by the zombie dog’s fire for two or three minutes. However, this monster-like tree was merely shrinking to itself, looking like a giant, black fist. No matter how ragingly the fire burned, the tree remained fine.</p> <p>As the fire failed to do any severe harm to the tree, the zombie dog took it back before baring its teeth and pouncing on the tree once again. Then, it violently swung its forepaws down at the tree.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the tree with surprise. How magical… that tree was actually not afraid of fire!</p> <p>Swish! The zombie dog brandished its sharp claws to scratch the tree, then landed on the ground. Right after that, it sprung back up and launched another claw attack.</p> <p>Its fire was ineffective to the tree, but claws weren’t.</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! A few leafless branches were neatly cut off.</p> <p>As the few branches were cut off by the zombie dog, the tree shook intensely. After that, it seemed to feel that the zombie dog wouldn’t release fire again within a short while, so it quickly unwrapped itself. Countless branches spread, then all swept toward the zombie dog which was charging at the tree again.</p> <p>This time, the zombie dog didn’t manage to react timely. It stepped on the branches, but while leaping away, it was wrapped up by another branch which reached out suddenly.</p> <p>“Aw-woo…” The zombie dog howled in panic, then was suddenly dragged down by the tree. Before it could react, the tree swiftly reached out other branches to coil around the dog’s hind legs, then began smashing it against the ground over and over again.</p> <p>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!</p> <p>“Roar… oar… ar…”</p> <p>Looking at the zombie dog which now looked like a dead dog, Lin Qiao silently sweated for it. Well, of course, she couldn’t actually sweat.</p> <p>It must be so painful!</p> <p>Hearing the dog let out shrill screams while being thrown at the ground once again, Lin Qiao felt that its internal organs must have been crushed already, even though it was a zombie dog.</p> <p>As the zombie dog was dizzied, the groove on the tree trunk suddenly widened like an opening mouth. Next, Lin Qiao saw the tree wrap the zombie dog up with all its branches, especially the dog’s head, as if to prevent it from releasing fire again. Then, the branches raised the dog and threw it toward the groove.</p> <p>Right at that moment, Lin Qiao made a move and suddenly rushed at the middle of the tree trunk.</p> <p>Before, no matter how intense the battle was, the middle part of the tree trunk was wrapped tightly. Therefore, Lin Qiao had only been watching the whole time. Anyway, she didn’t think that the level-five zombie dog would be defeated by the tree so soon.</p> <p>Seeing the zombie dog being dragged toward the middle area of the tree trunk, Lin Qiao guessed that the tree was about to feed. The middle area of the tree was the source of the rotten corpse smell, so it should also be the tree’s mouth.</p> <p>Therefore, as the tree wrapped the zombie dog up and dragged it toward the middle of the tree trunk, Lin Qiao seized this opportunity to charge.</p> <p>She moved so quickly that she was above the zombie dog within a moment. She stepped on the dog, then swung her claws downward. Meanwhile, she showed her face.</p> <p>From the battle that happened just now, Lin Qiao had learned that the tree wasn’t afraid of superpower attacks. The zombie dog’s fire failed to hurt it, but its claws managed to cut off a few branches.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao decided to cut the tree with her claws.</p> <p>The tree panicked upon sensing Lin Qiao’s sudden appearance, because her vibe gave it a very dangerous feeling, and she was right before its most vital area.</p> <p>Lin Qiao launched her attack once she showed up. After swinging her claws, she disappeared from above the zombie dog.</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! After she disappeared, a series of weird noise was heard from the tree, and then, the tree stopped moving.</p> <p>The zombie dog sensed danger and recovered from the dizziness once it was wrapped up by the tree. While being dragged into the tree’s mouth, it had been struggling the whole time.</p> <p>Now, the tree had stopped the moving, but the dog didn’t. Suddenly, the dog freed itself from the branches.</p> <p>The branches which had wrapped it so tightly all loosened, then softly fell to the ground, as if someone had switched them off.</p> <p>Thud! The zombie dog fell to the ground, then stood up while confusedly looking at the mutant tree. But soon, it was on the alert again. It slowly bent its forelimbs, its ears flattened back as it fiercely looked around with its pair of scary-looking beast eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao, turned and flipped in the air, then steadily landed on the ground.</p> <p>“Roar…” the zombie dog immediately fixed its eyes on her, then lowered its head and bared its teeth.</p> <p>Crack… At that point, a cracking noise was suddenly heard from the tree. Following the noise, the tree really started to crack from the middle of the trunk.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! The tree trunk fell into pieces on the ground loudly while a strong stench was instantly radiated from the broken tree trunk.</p> <p>The tree trunk was hollow. As it broke into pieces, some bone pieces and sticky fluid flowed out of it. Those bone pieces and the liquid which used to be blood and flesh should be the real source of the stench.</p> <p>While walking toward the tree, Lin Qiao covered her nose as she couldn’t stand the smell. After cutting open the tree, she sensed where its energy nucleus was.</p>",
  "Chapter 337: Where Are You Going?": "<p>“Roar…” The zombie dog didn’t grasp the opportunity to leave, but went crazy after seeing Lin Qiao walk toward the mutant tree. It gave a raging roar, then sprung up and leaped high, brandishing its claws to charge at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned, then raised an arm and conveniently swung it.</p> <p>Thud! The huge zombie dog which weighed about two-hundred kilograms was slapped away by Lin Qiao, as easily as slapping away a fly.</p> <p>“Stand still! Don’t move!” Lin Qiao pointed at it then yelled loudly.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie dog which had struggled back up from the ground refused to listen to her words at all. Instead, it rushed forward to attack her again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned around and raised another arm.</p> <p>Thud! Once again, she slapped the zombie dog away. This time, she didn’t stay where she was after sending the zombie dog flying away, but darted out fleetingly. Before the zombie dog landed on the ground, she suddenly leaped onto its neck and punched its head violently.</p> <p>“I told you to stand still, but you just won’t listen! Do you think you can take a beating because you’re a zombie dog? I’ll punch you stupid big dog to death!” While saying, she quickly and consecutively punched the zombie dog’s head.</p> <p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p> <p>“Aw… oar….” She punched the dog so quickly that the dog’s head was even sinking into the ground.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t hit the zombie dog with a great strength, so its head wouldn’t break. In the worst case, its head would be buried in the earth.</p> <p>“Roar… oar… ooo…” The zombie dog’s voice turned weaker and weaker, and Lin Qiao finally stopped her violence. She got off the dog, then pointed at it and gave another growl. Her pants were stained by the dirt and blood on the zombie dog’s body.</p> <p>“Don’t move! Roar!” She also gave the zombie dog a roar.</p> <p>With the warning roar, she successfully made the zombie dog quiet down. After that, she turned around and covered her nose while she kept walking toward the mutant tree. Seeing the black and stinky fluid flowing all over the ground, she stopped, then looked around and picked up a branch.</p> <p>The soft and flexible branch had now become a hard and dry, regular branch.</p> <p>Lin Qiao carried the branch and stepped on the broken tree trunk as she walked over to those bone pieces, then rummaged through the pile of bones with the branch.</p> <p>She pushed aside those bones, then found an energy nucleus which was inlaid in the tree trunk. Then, she quickly waved her claws at the nucleus for a few times to cut the piece of tree trunk into smaller pieces.</p> <p>After that, she turned those wooden pieces with the branch in her hand, and soon found the one with the energy nucleus. Next, she swept the piece of wood outward with the branch.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao finally picked the piece of wood with the nucleus out of the dirty fluid, a glass of water suddenly appeared in her hand. Next thing, she poured the water on the energy nucleus.</p> <p>After washing the energy nucleus with the water, Lin Qiao bent over to pick that piece of wood up.</p> <p>The energy nucleus looked like a gnarl on the tree trunk, a little smaller than Lin Qiao’s fists. Through her hands, Lin Qiao sensed a strange type of energy inside it.</p> <p>As she prepared to enter her space and ask Viney if she wanted that nucleus, she saw the zombie dog silently get back on its feet. It kept its belly on the ground, but slowly moved its limbs to inch its way into the woods nearby like a turtle.</p> <p>“Where are you going?” Lin Qiao watched its move and asked abruptly. Her voice made the zombie dog freeze.</p> <p>“Awoo…” The dog turned around and gave Lin Qiao a pitiful moan.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to it, then bent down and gripped the sticky and dirty fur behind its back, bringing it into her space.</p> <p>In the space, Lin Qiao threw the dog aside.</p> <p>“Don’t move!” Seeing the zombie dog struggle up the moment it landed on the ground and attempted to escape, Lin Qiao immediately shouted at it. Hearing that, the zombie dog instantly stopped moving.</p> <p>Before Lin Qiao turned to the lake to call Viney’s name, a few jade-white vines had already reached toward her from the lake. Specifically, those vines were reaching toward the piece of wood in her hand.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her hand and directly threw the wood at those vines. Viney accurately caught the wood piece, then rolled it up and drew back into the water, only reaching out a long vine to coil around Lin Qiao’s hand.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, Mama… This is great, this is great… This energy smells wonderful!’</em></p> <p>Recalling those bone pieces and sticky fluid, as well as the pungent stench outside, Lin Qiao honestly didn’t know which part of those smelled wonderful.</p> <p>“Do you know which level this tree nucleus is at?” she asked.</p> <p><em>‘Four, </em>‘ said Viney.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then pointed at the zombie dog which was now lying by her side and said, “No wonder this level-five thing couldn’t even defeat a tree.”</p> <p>Mutant animals and plants were normally stronger than same-level zombies or superpowered human beings, because their powers were unpredictable. It was difficult for people to estimate how powerful those creatures were or how much energy they had.</p> <p>They could be very powerful, or very weak.</p> <p>But reasonably speaking, zombie dogs should be more aggressive than zombies. The level-five zombie dog should be nearly as great as a zombie king in both terms of fighting capacity and reaction speed. However, it actually failed to kill a tree. What made it so weak?</p> <p>Wondering about that, Lin Qiao stared at the zombie dog curiously.</p> <p>Viney, who was coiled around her hand, sensed her thoughts and said to her,<em>‘Mama, Mama, this zombie dog can only hurt that kind of mutant tree with its claws. The dog’s fire power is ineffective on the mutant tree. The tree was able to absorb powers.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to look at Viney with surprise, asking, “How do you know the dogs has fire power? And how do you know what the tree was able do?”</p> <p>Viney responded a little proudly, <em>‘Once a creature comes inside this space, I can tell what kind of power it has.’</em></p> <p>“I see,” Lin Qiao responded.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, I may need to spend a long while to absorb the energy this time,’ </em>said Viney<em>, ‘Mama, be ready. I’ll fix your stomach after I have absorbed all the energy.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao automatically touched her stomach. She was curious about what was inside her stomach now, but didn’t dare to cut it open and find out… What if she ruined Viney’s work?</p> <p>“Alright, I’ll be waiting for you,” she nodded and said.</p> <p><em>‘With this mutant tree nucleus, both Mama and Viney will become different,’ </em>Viney said happily <em>, ‘Wait for Viney’s good news!’</em></p> <p>It sounded that some big changes would happen after Viney had absorbed the energy.</p> <p>“Great! I’ll be expecting your good news,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Viney unwrapped her, then drew back into the lake.</p> <p>After watching Viney disappear into the lake, Lin Qiao turned to look at the zombie dog which was huddled on the ground and shaking the whole time since Viney showed up.</p> <p>She fixed her eyes on the dog and looked at it from head to paws.</p> <p><em>‘So ugly! So disgusting!’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 338: Scoop the Moon out of the Water": "<p>The zombie dog honestly looked unpleasant. Its skin was cracked, and its fur was in locks, stained by the black and sticky blood. Its eye corners were chapped as well, with blood and flesh exposed; its teeth were white and long, looking very scary.</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted by its side and said, “Look at you… you’re so ugly. You’re my dog now, but I can’t take you out to meet the others. What if you scare the children?”</p> <p>“Roar…” The zombie dog turned its head to roar at Lin Qiao with discontentment, but didn’t dare to charge at her. On the contrary, it shrank its limbs and slowly crawled backward.</p> <p>Right at that moment, a rope-like thing was thrown up from the lake. Lin Qiao caught it and found that it was a thumb-thick vine, about five meters long and jade-white.</p> <p>Seeing the vine, Lin Qiao instantly figured out Viney’s meaning—Viney wanted her to use it as a dog leash!</p> <p>“Get over here,” Lin Qiao looked at the zombie dog, which had moved a few meters backward, and shouted at it.</p> <p>“Bow-wow!”</p> <p>The zombie dog refused to follow her order, but sprung to its feet and turned to run.</p> <p>“If you dare to run, I’ll catch you later and throw you into the lake!” Lin Qiao yelled at the dog.</p> <p>“Awooo…” After making two steps forward, the zombie dog stopped abruptly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao held the vine with both hands and cracked it loudly while saying to the dog, “In here, where do you think you can run? Huh?”</p> <p>“Roar…” The zombie dog turned around to bark at her, then ran toward the woods.</p> <p>Lin Qiao brandished the vine toward the ground, as if it was a whip. After that, she flashed across the air and swiftly chased after the zombie dog.</p> <p>She was able to clearly sense the dog’s current location, and the direction that it was moving in. So, she took a short cut to block its way.</p> <p>Because of Lin Qiao and the zombie dogs’ movements, Shen Yujen, who was sitting on a couch, had already hidden behind the couch, looking at the woods with fright.</p> <p>She was already frightened by Lin Qiao’s vibe, but the vibe of that zombie dog scared her even more badly. After all, Lin Qiao and the other zombies had all been restraining their vibes, while the zombie dog had its vibe released fully. Apart from that, the dog’s vibe was wild and fierce, like the vibe of a ferocious predator.</p> <p>Once the zombie dog rushed into the woods, it saw Lin Qiao leap down from the tree in front of it, and then the white vine in her hand fell onto its head.</p> <p>Lin Qiao tied one end of the vine into a slipknot, then leaped off the tree as the dog got close, and conveniently lassoed the dog’s big head.</p> <p>By the time the zombie dog realized what had happened, the vine was already around its neck.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>After leaping down, Lin Qiao firmly grasped the other end of the vine and tied it on the tree next to her.</p> <p>“Stay where you are, or I’ll really throw you into the lake!”</p> <p>“Roar! Oar!” The zombie dog which was tied on the tree by her roared ragingly and struggled while pulling the vine.</p> <p>Lin Qiao warned it, then turned and walked out of the woods, leaving the dog struggling alone.</p> <p>After coming out of the woods, she saw Shen Yujen. “Do you want to go out with me now?” she stopped and asked her, “I’m already on my way back to Sea City Base. We’re about one hour of drive away from the base now.”</p> <p>Shen Yujen glanced at the woods worryingly, then shook her head toward Lin Qiao and lowered her head gloomily. Lin Qiao couldn’t tell what she was thinking about.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t try to persuade her, but looked at her and nodded, “Alright.”</p> <p>After exiting her space, Lin Qiao looked at the time. It was already getting dark. So, she brought out the car and continued driving to Sea City.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In Sea City Base, Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying were staying in their old room while Yuan Tianxing and the others lived across the hallway. Li Zheng’s squad had gone to Hangzhou with Lin Feng, and only Du Yuanxing, Lu Junjie, and the other few soldiers who didn’t have superpowers were left here.</p> <p>At this moment, Yuan Tianxing and the others were all in Lin Wenwen’s room, sitting on the couch while leisurely polishing their guns, playing cards, or reading. Some of them were sitting by the window and looking outside.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen was busy in the kitchen, and Long Qingying was serving the food she made.</p> <p>“The dinner is ready. Get over here, guys!” After carrying a bowl of soup out of the kitchen, Long Qingying raised her head expressionlessly to say to the others.</p> <p>The few men in the living room immediately walked to the kitchen. Some washed their hands, some sat around the dining table, and some filled their own bowls with rice.</p> <p>“Do you think Miss. Lu and the others are gonna be back soon?” Du Yuanxing turned to look at the dim sky and said while biting his chopsticks.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen looked outside and replied, “If they’re coming back, they should be arriving at the base soon. However, Miss. Lu has always been traceless. Maybe she has arrived long ago, but hasn’t shown up yet.”</p> <p>“I agree,” Long Qingying nodded and said.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at Lin Wenwen and asked her, “Why didn’t you go with them? It’s not safe for you two girls to stay here. You shouldn’t go out too often during the daytime. We can handle the recruitment work.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen raised her head to look at him, then nodded and said, “We know. I just want to help you.”</p> <p>After saying that, she turned her eyes away and lowered her head to eat her rice.</p> <p>If Yuan Tianxing didn’t go missing for over a month last time, she wouldn’t so stubbornly want to stay around him. When he was missing, she was so anxious and worried that she might lose him. That was definitely torture for her, even making her feel suffocated. She didn’t want to suffer that pain again. So, even if it were dangerous, she still wanted to stay around him.</p> <p>She knew that she was being self-willed, but she could hardly control her feelings.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing didn’t know what to say when he saw the look in Lin Wenwen’s eyes. As he turned his head, he found that all the others were silently staring at him with meaningful smiles.</p> <p>“Why are you looking at me? Just eat,” Yuan Tianxing said to them smilingly. With that, those people immediately lowered their heads and began eating.</p> <p>“Deputy Chief, hurry up and get yourself a wife!” At that moment, Long Qingying, who had gone to the kitchen for rice, came back and said abruptly in a bland tone.</p> <p>“Eh-hem!” The others immediately turned to Long Qingying while Du Yuanxing nearly choked on the food.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing confusedly looked at Long Qingying and said, “Eh… getting a wife is a hard thing to do.”</p> <p>Long Qingying sat down and coldly glanced at him, then pointed her chopstick at Lin Wenwen and said, “Why is it hard? There is one girl in front of you. You’re so close to her, so why don’t you try pursuing her? Don’t you know that guys are waiting in lines for her?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen, who was pointed at by the chopsticks, embarrassedly hit Long Qingying’s hand with her own chopsticks and said, “Qingying, stop talking nonsense!”</p> <p>Long Qingying rolled her eyes toward Lin Wenwen and said, “Am I talking nonsense?”</p> <p>“What you do think?” She then turned to Du Yuanxing and the others and asked them.</p> <p>“Eh-hem-hem… That, ugh… Actually, Qingying is right! Deputy Chief, you can think about getting together with Wenwen!” Du Yuanxing blinked and gave his answer.</p> <p>Lu Junjie and the others only held their bowls as they quietly looked at Yuan Tianxing and nodded.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing glanced at them, then said, “Wenwen is single now, so you all have a chance.”</p> <p>Once he said that, the others instantly lowered their heads to focus on the food without saying a word.</p>",
  "Chapter 339: What Ling Ling Thinks": "<p>In Wu Chengyue’s place, Meng Yue was sitting behind the dining table, eating the rice in her bowl. She hesitated for a moment, then abruptly raised her eyes to look at Wu Chengyue, who was sitting beside her and watching Wu Yueling eat.</p> <p>“You… Why did you ask your people to find cosmetic contacts for that zombie?”</p> <p>Hearing that question, Wu Chengyue glanced back at her and responded with a faint smile, “What’s wrong? I just feel that she looks too suspicious wearing sunglasses all day. It’s better to get her some cosmetic contacts.”</p> <p>Meng Yue paused briefly, her eyes showing an indescribable expression. She slightly dropped her eyes and moved her chopsticks.</p> <p>“Is it because she helped Ling Ling to get through the awakening of her power?” she asked.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded frankly and replied, “Em, yeah! I feel that those cosmetic contacts aren’t good enough as a gift for her to thank her for help though. However, I also think that she’ll like them.”</p> <p>Meng Yue’s hands stopped moving for a second. After that, she smiled and said, “Yeah, those aren’t good enough. She has saved Ling Ling more than once, and you have barely thanked her yet. Why don’t you offer her yourself?”</p> <p>Her last sentence was clearly a joke, so Wu Chengyue glanced at her smilingly and responded, “Do you want me to feed zombies with myself?”</p> <p>After saying that, he looked at Wu Yueling, who was eating by herself with chopsticks, and continued, “I want to find her a mommy, but I’m worrying that I might make the wrong choice and end up hurting her.”</p> <p>Wu Yueling hadn’t mastered chopstick-using yet, but she was already able to pick up food by herself. Her moves were clumsy, but made her look adorable.</p> <p>She wasn’t paying attention to the conversation between those two adults at first, but upon hearing Wu Chengyue mention finding her a mommy, she suddenly paused, and her large eyes started glowing.</p> <p>She soon lowered her head to continue eating, yet the glow in her eyes kept growing brighter and brighter.</p> <p>After hearing what Wu Chengyue said, Meng Yue silently sighed in relief. She looked at Wu Chengyue and said, “In fact, if Ling Ling isn’t your biological daughter, so you can just have another child.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue shook his head and replied, “What does that have to do with if she’s my biological daughter or not? My blood doesn’t flow in her, but I love her, and she loves me, her daddy.”</p> <p>Meng Yue looked at her, but stayed silent.</p> <p>Wu Yueling finished the food in her bowl, then put down the chopsticks and raised her head to look at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue grinned and said to her, “Did you finish? If you did, you need to wipe your mouth. Do you understand?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling picked up the napkin on the table and wiped her mouth with it, then jumped off the chair and trotted toward the living room.</p> <p>“You can’t run so fast with a full stomach, or you might get a stomach ache,” Wu Chengyue said to her.</p> <p>Wu Yueling immediately stopped. She turned back to give her father a glance, then began walking toward the living room. She sat onto a couch and scooped up the gray rabbit which was huddling there, then put it on her lap and brushed its soft fur with her tiny hands.</p> <p>The rabbit squatted on her laps motionlessly, seeming to enjoy her petting.</p> <p>While stroking the rabbit, Wu Yueling looked at Wu Chengyue and began thinking about what he just said.</p> <p><em>‘Is Daddy finding me a mommy? But I don’t want anyone to be my mommy… I only want daddy! What is a mommy actually? Can I eat a mommy?’</em></p> <p><em>‘But, well, if I can get the zombie sister and daddy together, it’ll be nice. I wonder if Viney’ll agree with that. I so want to play with Viney… When will the zombie sister come to visit me?’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling had many thoughts in her head, but Wu Chengyue didn’t know that his words had caught the kid’s attention.</p> <p>As Wu Yueling went to the living room to play with the rabbit, Wu Chengyue started eating his food.</p> <p>After dinner, he and Meng Yue sat on a couch to talk about some serious stuff.</p> <p>“Recently, you need to watch Yang Chao and his people closely. Also, you have to tell Dashu and Moli to pay attention to what’s happening in the research institute,” said Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Meng Yue nodded and responded, “We haven’t found anything yet about that robber who was secretly working with Yang Chao. Do you think it’s possible that he has already made his way into the base?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded in agreement, “That’s possible… His targets are Lin Feng and his people, but they arrived at our base safely. So, I guess that the robber won’t give up so easily. Yang Chao might have let him in already. We just don’t know where he is now. Perhaps, he followed Lin Feng out today.”</p> <p>After saying that, he paused for a second, then continued, “But, as long as that female zombie is with them, that robber won’t be able to cause them any harm, even if he’s at level-seven.”</p> <p>“Why?” asked Meng Yue with confusion, “Is Miss. Lu above level-six already? But, I didn’t sense such a strong energy from her.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue shook his head and said, “Not her. I mean the other people who are with her.”</p> <p><em>‘Or, the other zombies?’ </em>He didn’t say that last part out loud.</p> <p>Ever since Miss. Lu took off her sunglasses to show him her eyes last time, Wu Chengyue had been feeling that her delicate face without makeup was a little familiar.</p> <p>Where had he seen that face? Women had become rare after the apocalypse. So, he believed that he wouldn’t forget about such a pretty woman after seeing her.</p> <p>Also, her pretty face with that pair of purely black eyes would be quite scary and weird to a person who knew nothing about her.</p> <p>However, for some reason, Wu Chengyue only felt interested in her eyes. That day, he saw her black eyes and green pupils, which weren’t beautiful at all, but he just wanted to see them again and again.</p> <p>“There’re other people?” asked Meng Yue, “Or, do you mean other zombies?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at her, but didn’t nod or shake his head, only saying, “I just felt that she has a greater power in her.”</p> <p>Meng Yue nodded and said, “I felt that too. That power isn’t the same as her own energy.”</p> <p>“Yunlong should be back tonight,” said Wu Chengyue, “Tomorrow, you two stay in the base. I’ll lead the army out alone.”</p> <p>His words made Meng Yue stunned. “You’re going out alone? Why? Don’t we always go out together…”</p> <p>He took her with him almost every time he left the base before, but why did he want her to stay here this time?</p> <p>“Yang Chao has started to do things recently,” said Wu Chengyue, “So, I need you two to stay here to guard the base. Zou Shihui is just an onlooker. I’m worrying that Yang Chao might take some actions in the base while I’m not around.”</p> <p>Meng Yue raised her head looked at him while opening her mouth to speak. However, Wu Chengyue didn’t let her say anything.</p> <p>“Yue, that’s an order,” Wu Chengyue looked at her with a faint smile and said. His eyes were wearing the same usual smile, but they had also clearly told Meng Yue that his command was irresistible.</p> <p>Meng Yue somehow had a grievance in her heart, but she still nodded. She felt that Wu Chengyue had never put her on equal footing with himself.</p>",
  "Chapter 340: The Younger Brother of Lu Family Shows Up": "<p>It was already eight or nine o’clock at night when Lin Qiao nearly arrived at the base. She stopped the car where the guards of the base couldn’t hear its noise, then put it back into her space. After that, she walked toward the base.</p> <p>The doors of the base were already closed. She turned herself invisible, then clasped the fence wall with her claws to climb up. After climbing on top of the wall, she directly jumped into the base.</p> <p>During the nighttime, many places in the base were dark; only the central area had streetlights. In the periphery area, only some residential buildings had lights, as the power supply of the other areas was cut off.</p> <p>Therefore, the people who lived in the base wouldn’t go out at night, unless they had something important to do.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked toward Region D through a dark road. When she was about a mile away from where Lin Wenwen lived, she sensed a few different scents which made her stop walking.</p> <p>She found a dark and empty corner, then brought Shen Yujen out of her base.</p> <p>Pointing at one direction, she said to Shen Yujen, “Over there are the people you want. Now, you can see things as clearly as in the daylight, and you need to learn to differentiate the scents of people with your nose. Control your hunger, and don’t hurt innocent people.”</p> <p>Shen Yujen nodded, then looked where Lin Qiao was pointing. She sniffed at the air, then as Lin Qiao said, she sensed a familiar and disgusting scent from a long distance away.</p> <p>She immediately popped her eyes and began widening her mouth to bare her teeth.</p> <p>“Go,” said Lin Qiao, “Be careful, don’t expose yourself. You look exactly like a human being now, so as long as you don’t try to speak, you’ll be fine.”</p> <p>Shen Yujen nodded, then turned and left.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned invisible and followed behind her. The direction she showed to Shen Yujen was also the direction of where Lin Wenwen lived.</p> <p>She didn’t follow Shen Yujen very closely. Instead, she glanced around at the nearby buildings, then chose one and nimbly climbed up like a monkey.</p> <p>Standing on the roof, she watched Shen Yujen walk through a dark alley. When people approached, she would hide before they saw her, and when they left, she would continue moving forward quietly.</p> <p>At that moment, on a crossroad outside the neighborhood which Lin Wenwen and her friends lived in, two groups of people ran into each other.</p> <p>“Deputy Chief Piao? It’s so late! Why did you come here? Do you have something important to do?” Lu Tianyi stood on one side of the road and asked Piao Gecang, who was on the other side.</p> <p>Standing around him were Kong Qingming, Huang Shou, Liu Jing, and a few others.</p> <p>Piao Gecang, who was standing on the other side of the road, rested his hands in his pockets while looking at Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming from head to toe. While smiling, he responded, “Ah, aren’t these the two white chrysanthemums on Chief Zou’s side? I was going to ask you why you came here so late at night. Are you doing something that you can’t tell the others? Is that why you came here while it’s all dark?”</p> <p>Both Piao Gecang’s way of speaking and the smile on his face were toned with an unfriendly and sarcastic meaning, even containing some agitated, evil desire.</p> <p>By ‘white chrysanthemums’, he clearly meant that Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming were two proud pretty boys. That was their nickname, given by those men who coveted their beauty but couldn’t get it.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi smiled faintly; his smile was elegant, showing no anger at all.</p> <p>“Deputy Chief Piao, if you have nothing to do around here, please just go back. This is the guest area of Special Region A. I don’t think it’s appropriate for you, the Deputy Chief of Special Region B, to show up in someone else’s territory,” he said.</p> <p>Kong Qingming, who stood beside him, was also wearing a smile. But unlike Lu Tianyi’s, his smile was a little wicked, looking very charming and tempting on his pretty face which didn’t have any obvious gender-based features.</p> <p>To what Piao Gecang called them, they didn’t make any specific reaction, as if they didn’t hear it. All they did was maintain that their smiles. However, the ones behind them changed the looks on their faces, grimly staring at Piao Gecang and his people.</p> <p>Piao Gecang responded to Lu Tianyi’s words, also with a faint smile, “I’d like to know what makes you think that you can talk to me like that. I’m not your direct leader, but I am a Deputy Chief. So, before you start talking, you should watch your tone of speaking.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi was completely careless about his warning. “This is Region D,” he said with that smile, “Neither of us has any qualifications to demand anything from each other. I was just kindly giving you a suggestion. As the Deputy Chief in Special Region B, I wonder if you have Chief Wu’s permission to come here so late at night! There’ll probably be a misunderstanding again if he knew that you’re here, won’t there? I showed up here under Chief’s order, also with Chief Wu’s permission.”</p> <p>Piao Gecang’s smile faded as he coldly looked at Lu Tianyi and said, “Why I came here is none of your business. I recommend you not to put your finger in someone else’s pie.”</p> <p>Right at that moment, a series of footstep sounds were heard from the roadside. Following the sound, a figure showed up. The light from the residential buildings nearby couldn’t reach this area, so the people on the scene only saw the silhouette of a woman.</p> <p>They shone their flashlights on that figure, then saw that it was a long-haired woman who was slowly approaching them.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and his people looked at that woman with surprise. It was late at night. Normal people rarely came out at this time, so it was very strange for a woman to show up out here all alone.</p> <p>The look on Piao Gecang’s face changed when he saw the woman’s face clearly. He quickly tilted his head to ask the man beside her, “Why is she here?”</p> <p>Wasn’t this woman locked in that room in Region F?</p> <p>The few men behind him were all staring at the woman who was walking toward them; their faces showed a serious look as well.</p> <p>Shen Yujen slowly walked over and stared at Piao Gecang. Her face under her disheveled hair was expressionless.</p> <p>“Why are you standing here? Go and take her away!” Seeing that Shen Yujen was less than three meters away from him and his people, Piao Gecang yelled at the man beside him. Hearing him, his subordinates immediately stepped forward, preparing to surround Shen Yujen and catch her.</p> <p>“Wait a minute! What are you doing?” Lu Tianyi said to Piao Gecang suddenly and loudly. Meanwhile, he quickly made a few steps forward and stood between Shen Yujen and those men to stop them.</p> <p>“Who are you? Why are you out here so late at night? Go back to where you live,” Kong Qingming walked over as well to shield Shen Yujen behind him, then turned to say to her.</p> <p>When she sensed the nice scents from Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming, Shen Yujen’s empty stomach began growling. She hurriedly took two steps backward to keep a distance from them.</p> <p>Then, she shook her head and raised a hand to point at Piao Gecang. Her eyes showed a strong hatred.</p> <p>Kong Qingming sensed her agitated vibe, and also detected the hatred toward Piao Gecang in her eyes. Instantly, he figured out what this woman was here for.</p> <p>He turned to ask Piao Gecang, “Did you do something bad to her?”</p>",
  "Chapter 341: Shen Yujen Bites People": "<p>“You must have done something to her. She’s apparently here to give you trouble,” Kong Qingming turned to say to Piao Gecang.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi glanced at Shen Yujen, then turned back to Piao Gecang. The smile on his face was already gone. “Deputy Chief Piao,” he said to Piao Gecang with a serious look, “a man who always travels at night may have a chance of see inga ghost. For all the things you’ve done stealthily, have you ever thought that your victims will find you one day and take revenge?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming both knew that Piao Gecang wasn’t a good man. He loved to harass people’s wives and girlfriends, and force those poor women to do what he wanted. The women who fell into his hands never managed to go back home. Many people suspected him and hated him, but couldn’t do anything to him.</p> <p>He only chose the women from commoner families or low-positioned superpowered families to hurt. If the victims’ families found out about him, he would send his people to kill them.</p> <p>Now, as a woman stood in front of him and stared at him with hatred. Lu Tianyi figured that Piao Gecang must have done something to her that caused this result. Also, he just ordered his people to capture the woman right in front of Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>Hearing Lu Tianyi’s words, Piao Gecang had a faint murderous intent flashing across his eyes. Abruptly, he laughed and said, “Mr. Lu, I don’t know what you’re talking about. This woman is dangerous. To prevent her from hurting the others in the base, you better hand her to me.”</p> <p>While speaking, he raised a hand and crooked his finger toward his subordinates who were behind him. Following his move, the few men who were stopped by Lu Tianyi instantly kept moving toward Shen Yujen.</p> <p>Seeing that Piao Gecang actually ignored him and his friends, and so brazenly attempted to capture that woman right before their eyes, Lu Tianyi’s face darkened. He wanted to say something, but suddenly, a hand reached before him and stopped him.</p> <p>He turned back to see that Shen Yujen shook her head toward him gratefully, then walked past him, toward Piao Gecang.</p> <p>“Don’t go over there! It’s dangerous!”</p> <p>“What are you doing?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming both shouted at Shen Yujen. However, because of her current attitude, they didn’t try to stop her again.</p> <p>First, they decided to respect her, and second, they were both curious about what she was going to do to Piao Gecang. Also, they would watch him closely, and were already ready to fight him. Even though they couldn’t defeat the level-six Piao Gecang, they didn’t plan to let him take her away just so easily.</p> <p>Piao Gecang felt a little strange, as Shen Yujen didn’t run away because of fear upon seeing him. On the contrary, she directly walked toward him. Seeing her coming straight at him, he raised a hand to signal for his subordinates to stop because of curiosity.</p> <p>After that, he waited for Shen Yujen to walk up to him.</p> <p>Shen Yujen stood in front of him. A few flashlights straight on her eyes, yet she gazed at Piao Gecang without even blinking.</p> <p>“What do you want? I don’t know how you ran out, yet I’m surprised that you didn’t go home, but stupidly came to me. I wonder what is in your head…”</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>Right when Piao Gecang was talking to her, Shen Yujen’s face suddenly twisted. She uttered a thunderous roar toward him, then violently pounced upon him.</p> <p>As a level-six superpowered man, Piao Gecang reacted quickly. However, it was still too late for him to dodge when Shen Yujen charged at him, because the distance between the two of them was too short. He only automatically raised his arm and swung it toward Shen Yujen’s widely opened mouth.</p> <p>“Roar!” As a result, Shen Yujen was pushed aside by him, but she still managed to bite off a piece of flesh from his arm. She fell to the ground, then stood back up, her mouth covered in blood.</p> <p>She chewed that piece of flesh loudly, then spat out the cloth piece in her mouth.</p> <p>After watching her pounce, bite, and chew human flesh, the others were all stunned.</p> <p>“What are you looking at! Blow her head off!” Piao Gecang burst in raging growls. His entire face was twitching and teeth were bared because of the pain, as a piece of his arm was bitten off.</p> <p>Only after hearing his voice did his subordinates realize what had happened. They automatically raised their guns and fired at Shen Yujen.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! A series of gunshots echoed through the darkness of night.</p> <p>The sudden gunshots immediately caught the attention of the people who lived in the residential area nearby. Quite some of them walked to their windows to see where the shots were heard from.</p> <p>“Roar!” The moment those people fired, Shen Yujen swiftly rushed into the garden nearby. She was as fast as a wild animal which was hunting at night.</p> <p>“Go after her! Don’t let her get away! She has become a zombie! We can’t let her run about in the base!” Piao Gecang covered the wound on his arm, looking very miserable. After saying that, he suddenly noticed the wound, and then he showed a dramatical change of expression, as his entire face began twisting.</p> <p>He couldn’t have imagined that the woman had actually turned into a zombie already. Just now when she pounced on him, her movement and her ferocious face looked made her look exactly like a zombie.</p> <p>Piao Gecang only came to this area to try to find some information about the two women from Hades Base. But unexpectedly, he ran into Zou Shihui’s people, and the woman who was kidnapped and tortured by him two days ago.</p> <p>That woman had somehow become a zombie, and crazily given him a bite. So, the wound on his arm must have been infected by the zombie virus already.</p> <p><em>‘No, I need to go to the hospital now… No, no, I have to go to the research institute! Those useless people in the hospital have no way of solving this. Only the research institute might have a solution!’</em></p> <p>At this moment, Piao Gecang had already panicked knowing that he was infected by the virus. He was only thinking about one thing, which was how to save himself from becoming a zombie. As his subordinates all went to chase that woman, he hurriedly turned to run toward the research institute.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi, Kong Qingming, and their friends were left dumbfounded.</p> <p>“Damn! What just happened…” Huang Shou said with a shocked face, as if he had just seen a ghost.</p> <p>“Who knows!” The others were as stunned as he was. They had actually seen a zombie inside the base! What did that mean? That meant that a zombie had managed to enter the base, and that the base was no longer safe!</p> <p>“Why didn’t she… attack us? And I think, she was only targeting Piao!” Lu Tianyi suddenly murmured to himself. Hearing his words, the others all paused instantly.</p> <p>“Because she’s only here to revenge. She won’t hurt innocent people.” A hoarse voice was abruptly heard from nearby.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and his friends were startled at first. Then, they quickly turned to the source of the voice while shining their flashlights on that area. Then, they saw a woman wearing a pair of sunglasses and a baseball hat standing there, looking pretty suspicious. She was looking at them, her lip corners curved in a smile.</p> <p>“Eh? It’s your sister!” At the sight of her, Kong Qingming turned to say to Lu Tianyi with surprise.</p>",
  "Chapter 342: Tang He Left": "<p>Lu Tianyi had a delighted look flashing across his eyes, but he didn’t let that become obvious. Instead, he turned to say to Kong Qingming, “Don’t talk nonsense in the base.”</p> <p>After all, there would be a trouble if her true identity was exposed in the base.</p> <p>“I get it,” Kong Qingming rolled his eyes and responded.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi then turned to Lin Qiao and said, “It’s really you. I thought Chief Wu was looking for someone else!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave him a glance, then asked, “Why did you come here so late?”</p> <p>“Our Chief received a message which says that Yang Chao is preparing to do something to those Hades Base people, then make Chief Wu take the blame. We’re here to inform the Hades Base people about that,” said Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned toward the way Shen Yujen had disappeared, then spent a moment sensing her current situation. She should be safe hiding in the darkness of night.</p> <p>After that, she turned back to say to Lu Tianyi, “You go and find them now. I need to leave for a while. I still have one problem to solve.”</p> <p>Finishing talking, she glanced up at the residential area that Yuan Tianxing and the others stayed in, then suddenly disappeared in front of Lu Tianyi and his friends.</p> <p>“What problem?” Lu Tianyi, Kong Qingming and the others looked at each other, and one of them asked that question.</p> <p>Kong Qingming shook his head and said, “I don’t know. We should go upstairs to find them first. It’s getting late. Let’s just finish our job and go back early.”</p> <p>After saying that, he abruptly stared at Lu Tianyi with disdain, continuing, “It’s you who told me to keep an eye on those people, but just now, you actually gave the credit to our Chief. You’re so shameless!”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi gave him a smile, then looked around and nodded. While walking toward the residential area, he responded, “If I didn’t do that, my motivation would become suspicious, wouldn’t it? Did she bring that zombie woman in here? That woman seems to have become a true zombie. I wonder what will happen to Piao at last.”</p> <p>Kong Qingming shrugged and replied, “Who knows? I hope he becomes a zombie, so I can just blow his head off.”</p> <p>At that point, Huang Shou, who was behind the two of them, asked, “Ugh… Is it bad for that female zombie to stay in the base? She’ll bite people, won’t she?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi answered that question carelessly, “No. The zombies she brought in won’t bite people randomly. You’ve seen what happened just now. That female zombie acted like normal human beings in front of us. She only targeted Piao. It’ll be fun if he turns into a zombie too.”</p> <p>“Don’t we need to follow Piao to see what’s happening now?” asked Huang Shou.</p> <p>“No need,” Kong Qingming smiled, “He’s definitely heading to the research institute. That’s their territory. It’ll be more fun to let him bring troubles to his own people.”</p> <p>“Don’t worry!” Lu Tianyi, said “I don’t think he has a big chance of surviving even if he makes it to the research institute. Also, some people in the research institute are under Chief Wu’s command. He going there will provide Chief Wu with a great reason, won’t it?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Huang Shou and the others glanced at each other. “So, it’s none of our business now?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming both nodded.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned invisible, then entered that residential area and walked toward a residential building. As she got close enough, she hopped onto the balconies and climbed straight to the roof.</p> <p>On the roof, she stood by a corner, looking at a man on top of the stair room.</p> <p>She was a little surprised to find that this man had actually managed to enter the base. Also, she wondered who this robber leader prepared to make moves on.</p> <p>She didn’t know who was Tang He’s target, and Tang He didn’t know that someone was already staring at him from behind.</p> <p>He glanced at the area where Piao Gecang and Lu Tianyi were lingering before, then showed a grim look.</p> <p>“Douchebag!” He cursed with a frown, then turned and prepared to leave. However, he paused for a second once he turned around, then looked around. As he found nothing suspicious, he began wondering if he had been overthinking just now.</p> <p>After that, he turned back around and leaped off the building; following behind him was an invisible figure.</p> <p>Before leaping off, Lin Qiao glanced at Lin Wenwen’s room. She was very glad that she came back in time, because something terrible nearly happened in this place.</p> <p>Also…</p> <p>She then glanced at Lu Tianyi and his friends.</p> <p><em>‘That kid thinks I don’t know what he’s been thinking? </em>‘ she thought.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Lu Tianyi and his friends went into the residential area, then took the stairs to Yuan Tianxing and Lin Wenwen’ rooms. After reaching there, Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming each knocked on a door.</p> <p>Long Qingying opened the door and saw a pretty man. She had to glance down at his chest to confirm that the person she saw wasn’t a woman.</p> <p>“How can I help you?” she said.</p> <p>The wicked smile froze on Kong Qingming’s face as a sharp-eyed woman had just looked at his chest to confirm his gender. But soon, he forgot about that uncomfortable feeling and smiled again while asking, “I wonder if Lin Wenwen is here.”</p> <p>Long Qingying motionlessly glanced at the others outside the door, then re-fixed her eyes on Kong Qingming and asked, “Who are they? Why are you looking for Wenwen?”</p> <p>Being stared at by her laser-sharp eyes, Kong Qingming got seriously nervous. He abruptly took two steps backward, then reached a hand backward and dragged over Lu Tianyi, who had just knocked on the other door.</p> <p>“Um… You take this side,” he said.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi, who was suddenly dragged over, didn’t know what was happening. He confusedly glanced at Long Qingying, then turned to Kong Qingming who was wearing a weird smile. After that, he looked at the others with puzzles in his eyes.</p> <p><em>‘What’s going on?’</em></p> <p>Huang Shou and the other two all spread their hands and shook their heads.</p> <p>Kong Qingming stood before Yuan Tianxing’s door and glanced back at Long Qingying. After that, he turned around with the back of his head toward the others.</p> <p>At that moment, Yuan Tianxing’s door was opened as well. Yuan Tianxing stuck his head out of the door and saw a few strangers standing outside. Not only had he opened the door, but Lin Wenwen’s door was opened as well.</p> <p>“What? Can I help you? Who are you?”</p> <p>On the other side, seeing the weird behavior of those strangers, the cold-faced Long Qingying attempted to shut the door.</p> <p>“Ugh… Please wait! We, um… We came here with a message about you guys. We want to tell you something. But of course, if you’re not interested, we’ll leave now,” Lu Tianyi reacted fast enough to stop Long Qingying.</p> <p>“About us?” Lin Wenwen’s voice was heard. She had heard what Lu Tianyi said as she walked up behind Long Qingying and curiously looked at him and his friends. Long Qingying turned back and made an eye-contact with her, then continued to stare at Lu Tianyi and his friends disbelievingly.</p> <p>At this point, Yuan Tianxing walked out from behind Du Yuanxing. He looked at Lu Tianyi and asked, “Who are you?”</p> <p>“I am Lu Tianyi, the Captain of Class Three, Agriculture Department of this base. This is my work ID. Don’t worry, we aren’t here to bring you any troubles,” Lu Tianyi showed Yuan Tianxing his work ID while speaking.</p>",
  "Chapter 343: Kindness Came to No Good": "<p>After spending a short while gazing at them, Yuan Tianxing invited Lu Tianyi and his friends in. He stepped aside to let them in, then said to Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying, “You two come over here too. Let’s see what it’s about.”</p> <p>“Alright,” Lin Wenwen glanced at Yuan Tianxing and nodded, then looked at Long Qingying and said to her, “Let’s go.”</p> <p>In Yuan Tianxing’s living room, Kong Qingming and Lu Tianyi sat on the couch, and Yuan Tianxing offered seats to Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying as well. Meanwhile, the others each found a place to stand.</p> <p>“What’s the message?” Yuan Tianxing looked at Lu Tianyi and asked.</p> <p>“In fact, we just ran into some people outside this residential area,” said Lu Tianyi, “They left because of us, or something else. However, we’re sure that they were here for these two girls.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and the other guys glanced at each other. Unlike them, Long Qingying asked coldly, “You’ve been here for a while. What is the message exactly? Can you just get to the point?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded and said, “You said that those people were here for us. Why them? Why are they targeting us? Have we ever offended them? Or, do they have any other purpose?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi looked at her and responded, “Chief Wu asked us to bring you the message. To undermine your cooperation with Chief Wu, Yang Chao has secretly sent someone to kidnap you two girls. Tonight, his people have already been making moves. Chief Wu’s side is short-handed now, so we came here to deliver the message, as we needed to come to this area for other tasks anyway.”</p> <p>Kong Qingming added, “As for if you have offended Yang Chao or not, we don’t know about that. But, we do know that you pissed his sister, Yang Yan, off. According to the message we got, Yang Chao is planning to kidnap you, and then inject the zombie virus into you, so that he can make Chief Wu take the blame. Based on his relationship with you, if a zombie problem happened on your side, he’d definitely have something to do with it.”</p> <p>“Is your message true?” Yuan Tianxing looked at Lu Tianyi and said, the expression on his face turning serious.</p> <p>“I think you’ve all heard the gunshots from down there just now,” said Lu Tianyi, “Earlier on, the man we met was named Piao Gecang. He’s Yang Chao’s Deputy Chief. He is a lascivious man who liked to rape women. I think he showing up here had something to do with these two girls.”</p> <p>After saying that, he glanced at Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying, then continued, “Why didn’t you leave with the others? As two girls, you staying here will only bring the others more troubles.”</p> <p>“It’s none of your business,” Long Qingying gave Lu Tianyi a cold, threatening glance, as that stranger just criticized her right to her face. Unlike her, Lin Wenwen fell into silence, just blinking. Seeing that Long Qingying seemed to lose her temper, she hurriedly comforted her.</p> <p>“Alright Qingying, he’s right. Staying here, we’ll only bring troubles to Tianxing. Next time, we’ll leave with them,” she said. She believed that Yuan Tianxing would leave by then as well.</p> <p>Long Qingying glanced at Lin Wenwen, then turned her face away.</p> <p>Hearing Long Qingying’s impolite words, Lu Tianyi had his smile faded as well. He felt that he got hated for his kindness.</p> <p>“It is none of our business, but if you bring troubles to our base and Chief Wu, it will become our business. So please, leave as soon as you can. You’re not welcome here,” he said.</p> <p>Then, he stood up and continued to Yuan Tianxing, “We’ve delivered the message, and we’ve saved you from the bad guys once tonight. However, the same things will certainly happen for a second and third time. You’re free to make any decisions. If some of you go missing, you should directly go to Yang Chao instead of begging our Chief.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, he turned and walked toward the door.</p> <p>Kong Qingming stood up as well. He smilingly glanced at Long Qingying and said, “Maybe our kindness came to no good. After the apocalypse, women are getting even more unreasonable.”</p> <p>After saying that, he followed Lu Tianyi out.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing leaned against the back of the couch, his arms crossed before his chest. The look in his eyes was serious as he was thinking about something.</p> <p>“Qingying, what’s wrong? Why were you so mad? Those guys meant well!” Lin Wenwen looked at Long Qingying with a confused look, as she didn’t understand why the latter reacted that way.</p> <p>Long Qingying snorted coldly, then said, “Nothing. I just didn’t like their attitude. We’ll bring troubles to the others? That’s our business too. We don’t need them to mind our business.”</p> <p>“Alright. They’ve said that it’s Chief Wu who sent them. Maybe they didn’t want to come. And now, they’ve suffered your unfriendly attitude. Besides, if what they said is true, that some people have eyes on us, we really shouldn’t stay in their base,” Lin Wenwen said with a soft voice.</p> <p>Long Qingying turned to stare at her and responded, “Now you’re saying this. This morning, who had asked to stay? Me?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen immediately gave her a grin and said, “It was me, me… I was wrong, alright? I was self-willed. I knew it was dangerous, but I still asked you to stay here with me. I was wrong, and I’m sorry! Please don’t be mad.”</p> <p>Long Qingying snorted to her and said, “I’m glad you’re aware of it. You chose to stay, so you need to deal with the consequences.”</p> <p>“I know, I know. I won’t be so self-willed again, okay?” Lin Wenwen said with a bitter face.</p> <p>“When have you two become so close?” Yuan Tianxing asked abruptly.</p> <p>The two girls turned around and saw the others staring at them with a strange look on their faces, their eyes saying…</p> <p><em>‘Is there something going on between them? Are they lesbians?’</em></p> <p>“What’s that look in your eyes? Shouldn’t good friends be like this? We’re just two girls, and you shouldn’t have that kind of a guess. Don’t you think that you’ve been overthinking?” Lin Wenwen said to the others.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing turned his eyes away and said, “If what Lu Tianyi said is true, we do need to be more careful. I didn’t think that we’d become a pain in the a*s for another leader of this base. Now we have trouble at hand.”</p> <p>“Was it them who caused the gunshots that we heard just now?” asked Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and said, “I don’t know, but it’s possible. We can assume that it was them, and we should all stay on alert.”</p> <p>“In this case, I don’t think it’s safe for us to live in that flat alone,” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Long Qingying glanced at her and responded, “I’ll be with you. What’re you afraid of?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and said, “Wenwen is right. Qingying, if you two live there alone, we might not be able to get there in time when danger arrives, and you alone won’t be able to protect the two of you from level-six attackers.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing agreed, “That’s right. So, Deputy Chief, you should live with them and protect them. Don’t worry about the other guys and me!” After saying that, he winked at the others.</p> <p>Tianxing didn’t know how to respond. Was putting him in difficult situations Du Yuanxing’s sole mission?</p>",
  "Chapter 344: There is No Antidote": "<p>Downstairs, Kong Qingming gloated over what Lu Tianyi had just experienced, saying, “See, you’re suspected because you want to be kind to them. This is the result of minding other people’s business.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi turned around and rolled his eyes as he responded crossly while walking, “Am I here to mind other people’s business? I only came here to confirm if that Miss. Lu mentioned in the messages you received is her. I don’t care about those people at all.”</p> <p>He came here only because he wanted to see her.</p> <p>“Ah, you don’t care about them,” said Kong Qingming. “Then, why did you drag all of us out so late at night just to deliver the message to them? And yet, they didn’t thank you.”</p> <p>“I don’t want those two girls to cause her any troubles,” said Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>“Alright, whatever you say!” Kong Qingming shrugged, “Ugh, just now, your big sister said that she needs to solve another problem. What is that?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi thought for a moment, then said, “I guess she has discovered someone suspicious. She has much keener sensations than we do, so she might have found some things or someone that we haven’t yet. Besides, the people whom Yang Chao sent to attack those people can’t be the brainless ones like Piao Gecang.”</p> <p>Kong Qingming said with surprise, “Not Piao Gecang? But, he did come here for Lin Wenwen and the other girl, didn’t he?”</p> <p>“Maybe Piao Gecang wasn’t sent here by Yang Chao. Maybe he wanted to come,” said Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>Kong Qingming looked at him and stayed silent for a while to think, then felt that it was possible.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao quietly followed behind Tang He. Soon, she found out that he was actually heading to the research institute. At that time, the research institute was empty, as all the staff had been off work. However, the door was wide open, and the lock seemed to have been molten.</p> <p>Tang He glanced at the distorted lock, then walked in, with Lin Qiao quietly following behind him.</p> <p>After a short while of walking, she saw Tang He stop before an isolation room. The door was opened as well. Through the glass wall, she saw a stairway that went down. From down there, she saw a faint light, and heard some people talking.</p> <p>Tang He looked around. Seeing that it was all quiet with no one else there, he walked into the isolation room and then went downstairs.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t follow him down immediately, but spent a short while observing the things in the room. There were some glass jars in the room that contained human body parts, soaking in liquid.</p> <p>After taking a few glances at those jars, she went down the stairs as well.</p> <p>It was a spiral staircase, at the other end of which was a very large laboratory right under the isolation room. The laboratory was illuminated by a few energy saving lamps. Some sealed large glass boxes were placed there in lines.</p> <p>At first glance, Lin Qiao spotted the zombies in those glass boxes. Those zombies were chained and gagged, their eyes covered.</p> <p>She knew that those zombies weren’t dead. However, they all looked drained, as a large amount of their blood has been drawn out of their body for experiments.</p> <p>She didn’t look at those glass boxes closely, but turned to the other side, which had a laboratory with glass walls. What was happening in there didn’t seem good.</p> <p>She walked over. Apart from Tang He who just came down, Piao Gecang was also in there. At the moment, his face had paled, eyes had sunken, and lips had turned purple.</p> <p>There were two other people in the laboratory; Lin Qiao had seen both of them. One of them was a bearded man, whom Lin Qiao remembered to be a doctor. The woman was his assistant. Her neck was gripped in Piao Gecang’s hand, and she was turning back to look at him with icy-cold eyes.</p> <p>“Liang Dashu… eh, I know you… you have developed the serum against the zombie virus… Give me… give it to me… Or, I’ll kill this woman!” Piao Gecang put one arm around Moli’s neck to threaten to strangle her while reaching a hand toward Liang Dashu and yelling at him.</p> <p>Liang Dashu looked at him calmly and said, “Deputy Chief Piao, do you know what your face looks like now? It’s as pale as a piece of paper, and your eyes have sunken, with dark circles under them. Also, your lips are purple. The virus inside your body is going to infect your brain soon. Do you know that?”</p> <p>Hearing his description, Piao Gecang popped his scary-looking eyes and shouted with both fright and anger, “Cut the crap! Give me the antidote… Give me the antidote now…” He stuttered and his voice was trembling, but he couldn’t help it.</p> <p>Liang Dashu just looked at him. However, before he could say anything, Moli—whose neck was squeezed in Piao Gecang’s hand—began talking.</p> <p>“There’s no antidote. Doctor Liang didn’t develop an antidote. The more anxious you are, the faster the virus will spread.”</p> <p>Piao Gecang tightened his arm, then lowered her head and glared at her while cursing, “Shut up! B*tch… Don’t, don’t expect me to believe you…”</p> <p>“Eh-hem…” Moli’s neck was strangled, which disabled her from breathing and made her cough. Right at that moment, Tang He, who had been quietly hiding behind the door, suddenly walked in.</p> <p>“I don’t know if you have an antidote or not, but I do know that you’re all gonna die.”</p> <p>He didn’t believe that this bearded doctor was truly able to develop an antidote. However, he understood that Piao Gecang was going to turn into a zombie, and the other two who knew about that had to die as well.</p> <p>“Who are you?” Liang Dashu stared at him and yelled alertly.</p> <p>“You… Why are you here? It’s not like that… I can still be saved…” Seeing Tang He, the look on Piao Gecang’s face changed drastically. He shook his head with fright and tried very hard to explain.</p> <p>Tang He walked in and looked at him while speaking, “He’s right. You look no different from a zombie now. Don’t you feel that your limbs are turning stiff? Don’t you feel cold? Do you have an urge to chew flesh and drink blood?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Piao Gecang suddenly lowered his head and fixed his eyes on the veins in Moli’s neck. His eyes showed his hunger and desire.</p> <p>Right at that moment, Liang Dashu suddenly took out his hands which had been hiding in his pockets. He swung one hand forward to throw three injectors toward Piao Gecang, and the other backward to pull a gun. He pulled out the gun and pointed it at Tang He.</p> <p>But still, he had underestimated his enemies.</p> <p>Piao Gecang quickly raised his head and clenched the fingers of his hand which was reaching toward Liang Dashu, catching the three injectors. Meanwhile, when Liang Dashu prepared to fire the gun, the gun suddenly fell apart.</p> <p><em>‘This is bad </em>!’ Liang Dashu said to himself upon watching that happen. He dropped the gun, but the gun didn’t fall to the ground. Instead, it floated before his face, distorting quickly.</p> <p>At the same moment, Moli abruptly took a step sideways, then turned and gripped Piao Gecang’s arm with both hands. After that, she bent her body and violently threw him away.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>Piao Gecang was thrown onto the ground violently. Lying on his stomach, he looked around with confusion, as he didn’t know what had happened and how he was thrown to the ground.</p>",
  "Chapter 345: The Doctor Died": "<p>After throwing Piao Gecang out, Moli immediately moved to Liang Dashu’s side, then turned around and shielded him.</p> <p>“We didn’t develop a cure, so we aren’t able to give you one even if you kill us,” Moli stared at Tang He and said to him fearlessly, even though she knew that this man was at a much higher level than her.</p> <p>Piao Gecang struggled up from the ground, yelling with disbelief, “That’s impossible… You must have a cure… You’re lying… I know you have…”</p> <p>At that moment, Tang He waved a hand. Following his movement, Liang Dashu’s gun, which had become a long and sharp needle thorn floating in the air, suddenly turned around and flew toward Piao Gecang’s head.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>Piao Gecang popped his eyes in shock when that metal thorn pierced into his head and sunk deep into his skull. A stream of dark-red blood flowed down his face from the middle of his eyebrows.</p> <p>Thud! Soon, he fell to the ground.</p> <p>“I hope you didn’t misunderstand this,” said Tang He. “I have no interest in the cure that you were talking about. No one in the world can possibly develop something like that. Otherwise, why don’t we even have any drugs to suppress the zombie virus yet? It has been five years, and we have had nothing, not to mention a cure.”</p> <p>Moli remained silent. Behind her, Liang Dashu asked with a calm look, “What do you want then? Are you gonna kill us?”</p> <p>Tang He gave a cold smile and responded, “Do you think I’ll let you tell the others that I killed this Deputy Chief?”</p> <p>Moli took a step backward to shield Liang Dashu firmly. They both knew that they might not be able to survive tonight.</p> <p>Moli had spirit power at level-five. She gazed into Tang He’s eyes, yet the latter made no response at all. Based on this fact, she figured that Tang He was at level-six or even above. Anyway, he had easily killed Piao Gecang, who was at level six.</p> <p>She and the doctor both guessed that the strange man was either at the peak of level-six, preparing to break into level-seven, or was already at level-seven.</p> <p>Because of the large level gap, Moli’s superpower attack was completely ineffective to Tang He.</p> <p>Liang Dashu had healing power, and zero fighting capacity. He had a gun, and maybe he was a good shot; but, the enemy happened to have metal power which disabled the gun. What was even worse, the metal-powered enemy was a level six or seven being.</p> <p>Killing both of them wouldn’t be too difficult for Tang He.</p> <p>“Yeah? Hehe, since you’ve said so, we don’t intend to die too easily!” At that point, Liang Dashu raised a grenade with its pin pulled out already. Meanwhile, he put his other hand on Moli’s shoulder and pushed her aside.</p> <p>Finishing talking, he threw the grenade at Tang He, then pressed Moli to the ground and shielded her with his own body.</p> <p>Tang He knew that something bad was going to happen when he watched Liang Dashu take out the grenade, so he quickly moved backward.</p> <p>This type of grenade wasn’t made from metal, so no matter how quickly he reacted, Tang He wouldn’t be able to stop it from exploding. Therefore, he had no other choice but to try and dodge.</p> <p>Lin Qiao, who had been watching this show outside the door, had stepped far away when Liang Dashu took out the grenade.</p> <p>Bang! Along with a thunderous sound, the entire underground laboratory was shaken. The small glass-walled laboratory where Liang Dashu and the other two stood was completely destroyed. The glass wall on the door’s side was shattered entirely.</p> <p>All the devices on the tables near the door broke into pieces while the ones on the other tables fell to the ground.</p> <p>A cloud of smoke rose.</p> <p>“Eh… Doctor! Doctor!” Moli, who lay underneath Liang Dashu, only felt an intense vibration. The latter had protected her from the explosive force caused by the grenade.</p> <p>“Pah… This… remember to… take… this to…” Liang Dashu lay his head on her shoulder and coughed out a large mouthful of blood, then weakly put a flash drive into her hand while saying a few words to her. However, his head tilted before he could finish his words. After that, he never moved again or let out any other sound.</p> <p>“Doctor! Doctor!” Moli hurriedly got up from the ground and held Liang Dashu in her arms in a panic. However, the latter didn’t give her any response.</p> <p>Moli put her shaking hand on one side of his neck to check his pulse, then put a finger under his nose to see if he was still breathing.</p> <p>Upon realizing that Liang Dashu was already dead, she froze.</p> <p>“Wake up! Go! Yang Chao’s people are here!” Suddenly, a hoarse voice told her to leave.</p> <p>“Who is it?” The startled Moli immediately turned to the source of the voice, but saw no one. However, she couldn’t ignore what that mysterious voice had said. Holding the flash drive, she looked at Liang Dashu, who was in her arms, while forcing herself to calm down.</p> <p>Soon, a series of footsteps sounds was heard from the outside. Hearing that, Moli was instantly on the alert.</p> <p>She looked around, then glanced down at Liang Dashu for the last time. After that, he put him on the ground and stood up, then turned and quickly walked out of the messy laboratory. She didn’t go to the stairs, but turned around and left from the other side.</p> <p>She couldn’t let anyone else have what Liang Dashu had just given her. So now, she had to leave this place and find Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>A few seconds after she had left, a group of armed soldiers burst in. They raised their guns and quickly came to the destroyed laboratory. Except for the two dead bodies, only broken glass and devices were there.</p> <p>“Go and find the files. He must have hidden them here!” A leader-look man yelled to the other soldiers with a cold face. Meanwhile, he had been looking around; clearly, he was looking for something.</p> <p>Once in, the others all began searching through the remains of the laboratory.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later, they had nearly turned the entire laboratory upside down, but found nothing.</p> <p>“Boss, we’ve looked for it up and down. It’s not here.”</p> <p>“It’s not here either.”</p> <p>“Maybe he didn’t put it here.”</p> <p>“He has a female assistant. She follows him everywhere. She’s not here, so maybe she has left with the files.” One said soldier to the leader.</p> <p>The leader looked around, then turned and said decisively, “Go and find that woman. Keep an eye on Wu Chengyue and his people. Don’t let her get close to Wu Chengyue. You take some people to guard the entrances. Don’t let her get out of the base.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!”</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao quickly followed Tang He away and found that he was heading toward Special Region B.</p> <p><em>‘Is he going to find Yang Chao? That bearded doctor seemed to have given something important to that woman before he died. I’m just wondering if Yang Chao has already known about that thing that she took away.’</em></p> <p>While thinking, Lin Qiao followed behind Tang He and also headed toward Special Region B.</p>",
  "Chapter 346: Targeting Lin Wenwen": "<p>With the help of her keen sensations and nimble, quiet movements, Shen Yujen managed to get rid of the few level three or four superpowered men who were following behind her under the cloak of the darkness.</p> <p>She quietly hid on top of a tree, trying her best to restrain her vibe.</p> <p>“She’s gone?”</p> <p>“Maybe she ran that way. Let’s split up and keep looking.”</p> <p>“Alright.”</p> <p>Those people quickly left separately. As they went far away, Shen Yujen leaped off the tree and sniffed at the air to find Piao Gecang’s scent. After that, she quietly moved toward where Piao Gecang was.</p> <p>Not long after those soldiers left, Shen Yujen showed up near that destroyed laboratory. She walked to the broken laboratory, looking at the two dead bodies who hadn’t been taken away yet.</p> <p>She made her way to Piao Gecang whose face was destroyed in the explosion, eyes fixed on the metal thorn stuck in his head. Then, she squatted, gripped the metal thorn and pressed it hard down.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>Piao Gecang’s skull was cracked open, exposing the red blood and white brain matter. The scent of his brain which had been infected by the zombie virus wasn’t good to Shen Yujen, but not bad either. It just wasn’t tempting to her.</p> <p>What attracted her was Liang Dashu’s brain. However, she didn’t prepare to do anything to Liang Dashu’s body, but stirred Piao Gecang’s brain with the strangely-shaped metal thorn.</p> <p>Soon, an energy nucleus fell out; the level-six nucleus was glowing brightly.</p> <p>Holding the nucleus, Shen Yujen quickly stood up, then turned and left.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Tang He had no idea that someone had followed him to Special Region B. He avoided all the others and sneakily found Yang Chao’s fancy apartment building, quietly entering as no other people were around.</p> <p>At that time, Yang Chao was at home, and his brother Yang Hui was sitting on his couch.</p> <p>“Brother, have you really sent someone powerful to get those girls?” Yang Hui looked at Yang Chao, who was standing in front of the French window, and asked.</p> <p>Yang Chao looked outside and responded without turning back his head, “I have. Just wait. If you want to play with that girl, you can go and find him after he has taken those girls away.”</p> <p>Yang Hui took a deep breath as he nodded excitedly and said, “Okay, I’ll wait.”</p> <p>At that moment, someone knocked on the door. Soon, a guard opened the door and said to Yang Chao, “Chief, Mr. Tang is here.”</p> <p>Yang Chao turned to look at him with surprise while saying, “So soon?” Then, he saw Tang He come in from the outside.</p> <p>No one in or outside the apartment noticed that when the guard opened the door to talk to Yang Chao, an invisible figure had quietly sneaked in. Lin Qiao walked to a corner with gentle steps and stood there, her arms crossed before her chest. She was waiting to hear the rest of their conversation.</p> <p>As the guard closed the door, Yang Chao looked at Tang He and asked curiously, “How’s it going? Do you have the girls?”</p> <p>Tang He walked to an empty couch and sat down, then took a glance at Yang Hui and turned back to Yang Chao as he answered his question, “No… One of your useless subordinates acted rashly and alerted the targets.”</p> <p>Once he said that, Yang Chao and his brother both gave a start, then looked at him with confusion. Yang Chao walked over and sat on the couch as well. “Who alerted the targets?” he asked.</p> <p>Tang He responded with discontentment, “Your Deputy Chief… the one named Piao Gecang or something… What a crappy name! He went near that residential area and ran into some of Zou Shihui’s people. They had some argument. In the end, a female zombie suddenly showed up. Piao Gecang was bitten by the zombie. After that, he went to your research institute and blew a laboratory up. I guess someone will soon come here to tell you about that.”</p> <p>Yang Chao and Yang Hui glanced at each other. “Piao Gecang? Why did he go to that area? People will surely suspect him if he went to that place late at night. What a fool!” Yang Chao said while his face turned dark.</p> <p>At that moment, Yang Hui said, “Earlier on, he had his eyes on the woman who often showed around Lin Wenwen. I didn’t think that he’d be so impatient that he’d go there himself. Did those Hades Base people see him?”</p> <p>Tang He shook his head and said, “He didn’t enter that residential area, so I guess those Hades Base people didn’t know what happened yet. However, Zou Shihui’s people went in, and I don’t know what they were up to.”</p> <p>“You just mentioned that a laboratory was blown up,” said Yang Chao with a grim look, “What happened there? Tell me about that first. Is Piao Gecang dead?”</p> <p>Tang He’s face was a little pale as well. He nodded and replied, “Yes, he’s dead. He almost turned into a zombie. He went to that bearded man for a cure, and then the bearded man killed himself with a grenade.”</p> <p>“What did you say? Liang Dashu died too?” Tang He’s last sentence made the look on Yang Chao’s face change.</p> <p>“Yeah, he died. What’s wrong?” Tang He looked at him confusedly.</p> <p>Yang Chao suddenly stood up from the couch and asked anxiously, “He’s dead? Did he say anything, or did he hide anything before he died?”</p> <p>Tang He was a little bewildered because of Yang Chao’s reaction. Suddenly, he recalled why Piao Gecang went to the laboratory, and then had his expression changed slightly as well, staring at Yang Chao with both surprise and doubts.</p> <p>“Do you mean that… had he truly developed a cure for the zombie virus?” he asked.</p> <p>“We’ll talk about that later,” said Yang Chao, “Did you see him hide something, or did you hear him say anything?”</p> <p>Tang He blinked, then said, “No, but the woman who was with him didn’t die. If you believe that he needed to hide something, I think he should have given that to the woman.”</p> <p>Yang Chao immediately turned around and quickly walked to the door before opening it. He said a few words to the guards outside, then watched them leave swiftly before closing the door and walking back.</p> <p>He glanced at Yang Hui, then said to him and Tang He, “You’re right! According to the information I collected, Liang Dashu has indeed achieved amazing progress with his experiments. I guess it’s about the zombie virus. He had been focused on this area. So, I believe that his research must contain some discoveries about how to control or weaken the zombie virus.”</p> <p>Then, he turned to Tang He and continued, “But he’s dead now. His research results are either hidden somewhere by him, or with that woman.”</p> <p>Yang Hui and Tang He both gazed at him in shock and disbelief. Tang He quickly processed what he had heard and said, “What are you waiting for then? Send your people to catch that woman!”</p> <p>Yang Chao replied, “Didn’t you see that I’ve already done it just now?”</p> <p>“So… Are we still gonna get Lin Wenwen or not?” Yang Hui asked abruptly and unsurely.</p> <p>“We will… Why not?” said Yang Chao blandly, “This time, the targets have been alerted, so we’ll wait until the next opportunity. They won’t leave the base so soon anyway. Even if they decide to leave, I’ll figure out a way to make them stay. I’ll also turn them into zombies to create trouble for Wu Chengyue.”</p> <p>While speaking, his mature and charming face wore a wicked and cunning look.</p>",
  "Chapter 347: An Eye for An Eye": "<p>Lin Qiao stood side, wearing a sullen look with beams of cold light flashing across her narrowed eyes. If she hadn’t been controlling herself, her murderous intent would have surged out of her body and charged at the three men in the room.</p> <p>Those men were actually planning to hurt her sister, Wenwen! Thankfully, she had returned to the base and followed the robber here to see what was happening. If she didn’t, these three men would continue trying to harm Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Yang Hui didn’t say anything, but Lin Qiao had already detected the obviously strong and cruel desire from his eyes. They didn’t only want to rape her, but also planned to turn her into a zombie, a weapon to hurt Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slowly turned and walked toward the French window. A glass door in that area was open; outside the door was the balcony.</p> <p><em>‘Good, he’s targeting my sister. Did he forget that she has a sister too?’</em></p> <p>She calmly walked to the balcony and nimbly hopped onto the guardrail, then leaped upward and directly climbed onto the roof. The three men in the room still had no idea that a zombie was here just now, and it had heard what they said.</p> <p>On the roof, Lin Qiao turned to another direction, then leaped down and landed in another balcony.</p> <p>She stood on the balcony, looking at Yang Yan and the two kids in the living room. She seemed to have been making some kind of food for the two kids. A man was beside her, playing a game with a tablet.</p> <p>After spending a while observing the people in the apartment, Lin Qiao turned to look at the armed soldier next to her.</p> <p>One on the balcony, one in the living room, two by the door. Five level-five superpowered men were guarding this family.</p> <p>At that moment, the soldier on the balcony was fiddling with his rifle. He took it apart, then put it back together, and then took it apart again.</p> <p>“Come here, my son! Look, isn’t this your favorite spring onion pancake? Mommy told someone to make it for you. Come and eat!” Yang Yan put a plate of nice-smelling pancakes on the table.</p> <p>A maid-like woman carefully stood beside her, looking at her with fright and concern.</p> <p>She was scared, because if Yang Yan’s son didn’t like those pancakes, they would fly at her face along with the plate in the next moment.</p> <p>The maid already had a few bruises on her face. Some pieces of broken plates scattered around her feet, and the trash can was filled with pancakes.</p> <p>She secretly glanced at the pancakes in the trash bin. Her mouth was watering, but she didn’t dare to make any move.</p> <p>This family was wealthy. The wife didn’t know how to cook, so they hired her as a maid. However, they only paid her with two steamed buns a day.</p> <p>Except for those two steamed buns, she wasn’t allowed to take anything, not even the things in the trash can.</p> <p>The maid hated Yang Yan and her family, who wasted food because they had someone powerful to depend on. The pancakes in the trash can could make a whole meal for three or four adults.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Yang Yan, her eyes showing coldness and ferocity.</p> <p>In the living room, Yang Yan was holding a small bowl with one hand. She picked up a piece of pancake with the other hand and reached it toward the little boy who was curling on the couch.</p> <p>“Here, my boy. Doesn’t it smell delicious? Do you want some?” Yang Yan gently coaxed the little body.</p> <p>The little boy was wrapped in a blanket, huddling on the couch. As Yang Yan put the pancake near his nose, he sniffed at it, then suddenly showed a look of dislike. Next, he swung a hand forward to knock the chopsticks in Yang Yan’s hand aside, along with the pancake.</p> <p>“I don’t want it… It tastes bad…” The little boy then burst in screams. After that, he covered his head with the blanket and refused to come out of it.</p> <p>Yang Yan wasn’t angry at the boy. However, she turned and picked up the plateful of pancake, then violently threw it at the maid who was standing aside with fear.</p> <p>“Go and make some new pancakes! You’re not allowed to leave until you have made something my son likes!” She screamed at the maid with rage.</p> <p>The maid had been preparing for this. As the plate flew at her, she hurriedly raised both arms to protect her face.</p> <p>Thud! The plate hit on her arm.</p> <p>After being hit with the plate, the maid didn’t dare to argue against Yang Yan, but quickly kneeled on the ground to clean the broken plate and pancakes while responding with a trembling voice, “Yes, yes, I..I… I’ll make some new, some new…”</p> <p>“Move! Why are you still kneeling here?” Yang Yan shouted at her. She had an anger in her heart that she couldn’t channel. Looking at her son, she even wanted to chop those Hades Base women into pieces and feed them to dogs.</p> <p>If they didn’t scare her son so badly, how would her son become like this? Now, the poor little boy couldn’t even eat anything, and could only drink water. He would just throw up everything he ate.</p> <p>She didn’t know what else to do, but told the maid to make some pancakes which used to be her son’s favorite. However, the result remained the same.</p> <p>Her brother promised to punish those people, but those people were still fine now. Nothing happened to them at all. For that reason, Yang Yan was so wrathful. She had no way to vent her anger, so she kept abusing the maid.</p> <p>The man who was playing a game in the living room completely ignored her screams, but calmly focused on the game.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slowly approached Yang Yan and coldly stood behind her. Abruptly, she reached out a hand to grasp Yang Yan’s hair.</p> <p>In the next second, Yang Yan disappeared. No one witnessed her disappearances though.</p> <p>The soldier in the living room wasn’t looking at her, and the one on the balcony was killing time with his gun.</p> <p>The little boy on the couch was still wrapped in the blanket. Only the five-year-old little girl raised her head, confusedly gazing where Yang Yan was.</p> <p>“Mom? Mom… Mom…”</p> <p>Hearing the little girl’s voice, the man in the living room though that the kid was getting bored. So, he didn’t pay too much attention to it, neither did he turn back his head.</p> <p>However, the soldier on the balcony did glance back after hearing the little girl, but didn’t see Yang Yan. He figured that Yang Yan might have gone to the kitchen or the bedroom, so he turned back around.</p> <p>…</p> <p>A second ago, Yang Yan felt that her hair were suddenly pulled by someone, and then, the couch that she was sitting on disappeared. Afterward, she fell to the ground, and then froze with shock.</p> <p>She raised her head to find that the world before her eyes had changed. Her living room was gone, so were her two children who were right in front of her.</p> <p>She was looking at a strange woods: dim, frightful, and spooky.</p> <p>She was so scared. She clearly remembered that she was at home, but why did she suddenly come to this place?</p> <p>She turned to look around with fright, but then, she despaired. She saw a zombie dog which was covered in blood, standing about a meter behind her.</p> <p>“Er…” A deep roar could be heard from the zombie dog’s throat. Dogs roared like that while preparing to attack.</p>",
  "Chapter 348: It May Cause A Stomach-ache": "<p>“Tear her apart.” When the frightened Yang Yan looked at that zombie dog which was drooling at her, she suddenly heard a hoarse and cold voice.</p> <p>“Roar!” After receiving the order, the zombie dog immediately pressed her down with its paws and opened its bloody mouth to bite her.</p> <p>“Ah…!” Puff!</p> <p>Yang Yan only managed to let out a screech before her skull was crushed in the zombie dog’s mouth. The zombie dog bit off half of her head, then chewed it. Even her skull was chewed up along with her scalp, brain, and hair.</p> <p>From above her nose, the upper part of Yang Yan’s head was bitten off.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over to drag the zombie dog away. “I told you to tear her apart, not eat it! Alright, stop eating. This kind of people might give you a stomach-ache!”</p> <p>She dragged the zombie dog aside with one hand and tried to pull Yang Yan’s body out from underneath the dog with the other.</p> <p>While chewing, the dog let out deep roars from its throat and firmly clasped Yang Yan’s body with its claws, as Lin Qiao was trying to take away its food.</p> <p>Lin Qiao tried for a few times, but the dog refused to let the body go.</p> <p>“Give her to me! You’ve bitten her face off. I don’t know if her family can still recognize her or not. It would be less fun if they can’t. Take away your claws!” Lin Qiao dragged the vine on the dog’s neck to pull it backward.</p> <p>“Roar… oar… oar!” The zombie dog didn’t dare to attack Lin Qiao. Seeing that its food was going to be taken away, it quickly swallowed the half head in its mouth and bit on Yang Yan’s shoulder, tearing off an arm and dragging it to the other side.</p> <p>Holding the arm in its mouth, the dog stepped far away from Lin Qiao, then got down on the ground and pressed the arm with both forepaws before beginning to eat.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Yang Yan’s body which had half a head and an arm missing, then at the zombie dog which was alertly chewing the arm on the other side. Then, she bent over, picked up the body, and flashed out of her space.</p> <p>Still, no one in that apartment found that Yang Yan had gone missing.</p> <p>Thud! A bloody corpse suddenly fell on the tea table before the couch. Half a head and an arm of the corpse were missing.</p> <p>At that moment, the little boy was lifting a corner of the blanket to look outside, and the corpse just came into his sight.</p> <p>“Ah!” The terrified boy’s scream echoed throughout the whole building.</p> <p>“Why are you…” Startled by the scream, the man in the living room nearly threw away the tablet in his hands. He turned back to snap at the boy, but saw a corpse lying right before his eyes.</p> <p>When the boy burst in screams, the few superpowered soldiers rushed in.</p> <p>Seeing the corpse lying askew on the tea table, they all fell into silence, feeling that they were going to suffer some real pain.</p> <p>The little girl gazed at the corpse, making completely no response.</p> <p>Soon, Yang Chao’s door, which was across the hallway, was opened as well. Yang Chao and Yang Hui rushed out.</p> <p>“Who is… this?” Yang Chao stared at Yang Yan’s body. Looking at those familiar clothes, Yang Hui murmured, “Can this be… Yan?”</p> <p>Yang Chao immediately raised his head to look at the others in the living room. “What happened? Who did this? Jian Feng, tell me.”</p> <p>While speaking, he turned to glare at the man who had been playing a game the whole time.</p> <p>Jian Feng shook his head and waved his hands with fright and helplessness while responding, “I… I… don’t know, I don’t know anything… She was sitting right here… Why is she suddenly… I don’t know what happened!”</p> <p>Yang Hui hurriedly walked to the little girl. He scooped her up and turned her head behind him, away from the corpse. Meanwhile, he yelled at Jian Feng, “Jian Feng! Why are you standing there? Go bring your son away!”</p> <p>Hearing that, Jian Feng hurriedly struggled up from the ground, as if Yang Hui’s words had saved his life. He ran to the couch area and held up the boy who was wrapped in a blanket, then stepped away to another side of the living room.</p> <p>Yang Chao looked at the few superpowered soldiers who were responsible for the safety of Yang Yan and her family, then said with a deep voice, “Do you have something to say to me?”</p> <p>Those soldiers glanced at each other. “We… We didn’t sense anything. We didn’t feel a trace of any strangers! No one came here!”</p> <p>The other soldiers nodded, but didn’t add anything.</p> <p>A person had died under their protection, and that was a fact. They failed to do their job, and that wouldn’t change, no matter how hard they tried to explain to Yang Chao. The latter only cared about the fact that they didn’t manage to keep what woman safe.</p> <p>In fact, those soldiers had already been waiting for death now. They should be dead, because they had failed to protect their Chief’s family. Also, Yang Chao wasn’t a soft-hearted man. On the contrary, he was cruel and heartless.</p> <p>As they thought, Yang Chao nodded at them, then suddenly waved a hand. Following his movement, the five superpowered soldiers were sent out of the balcony by a series of tiny tornadoes.</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>“Ahhh!.”</p> <p>A wave of shrill howls was heard. The four superpowered men were trapped in the tornadoes; sharp wind blades circled around them and cut their bodies. Vivid red blood fell from the sky near Yang Yan’s balcony like rain.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched those people’s reactions from the roof of the building in front of the balcony, then turned and leaped off the building and headed toward Lin Wenwen’s place.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Shen Yujen had left the research institute, grasping Lin Qiao’s scent from the air and finding that she was in the center area. Many powerful superpowered people were in that area, so she didn’t dare to go there. Therefore, she turned around and headed back to the residential area where she had attacked Piao Gecang before.</p> <p>Miss. Lu had told her that if she had nowhere to go, she could wait for her there. So, she hid in the darkness near the crossroad; soon, a figure showed up beside her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed Shen Yujen’s vibe from a long distance away. Therefore, she walked to her side and showed her face.</p> <p>“Get in. You can’t show up in the base now. You should hide there for now,” she said.</p> <p>Shen Yujen understood Lin Qiao’s meaning. Some people had already found out about her. Therefore, it wasn’t safe for her to stay in the base, and her staying there might bring troubles for others.</p> <p>She nodded to let Lin Qiao know that she was willing to stay in her space.</p> <p>Lin Qiao reached out a hand, prepared to bring her into the space. However, Shen Yujen dodged and took out an energy nucleus. Judging by the energy contained in it, it was a level-six nucleus.</p> <p>She handed the nucleus to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Did this belong to that man?” From the nucleus, Lin Qiao detected the same scent she had sensed from the man who was bitten by Shen Yujen. Shen Yujen nodded, then extended the nucleus further toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Is this for me?” Lin Qiao looked at her with surprise.</p> <p>Shen Yujen wasn’t able to absorb that energy nucleus now, but she could save it until she had reached a higher level.</p> <p>Shen Yujen nodded again, looking at Lin Qiao gratefully.</p> <p>“Do you want to pay me back with this? No need. I can get level-six nuclei if I want some. You keep it.” After learning about her intention, Lin Qiao refused her smilingly.</p>",
  "Chapter 349: Can’t Control Himself": "<p>Shen Yujen shook her head, refusing to accept Lin Qiao’s refusal. She picked up Lin Qiao’s hand and put the nucleus in it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao held the nucleus and said to Shen Yuzhen while shaking her head, “In fact, you can choose to work for me if you really want to thank me. This nucleus can make you stronger, so you’ll be able to help me.”</p> <p>Shen Yujen paused for a moment as she silently looked at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>She had become a zombie, and her power hadn’t woken up yet. She wanted to help Lin Qiao, but she didn’t think she could give her much help.</p> <p>Lin Qiao said to her, “So, if you want to work for me, keep this. After leaving this base, I’ll help you to improve your zombie level.”</p> <p>While speaking, she put the nucleus back in Shen Yuzhen’s hand.</p> <p>This time, Shen Yujen didn’t insist on giving the nucleus to Lin Qiao. She thought for a moment, then put the nucleus back and nodded at the latter.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen brought her into the space, then turned invisible and came back out, heading to Lin Wenwen’s room.</p> <p>Because of the warning given by Lu Tianyi and his friends, Lin Wenwen’s room was now heavily guarded. Lu Junjie and a few others were taking turns to guard on the balcony. In the living room, Du Yuanxing was looking at Yuan Tianxing with disdain.</p> <p>“Why are you looking at me? Didn’t you say that I should come here to protect the girls? How can I protect the two of them alone? Isn’t it good for us to do it together?” Yuan Tianxing, who was sitting on a couch and reading a book, calmly glanced at Du Yuanixng and said.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing rolled his eyes and said, “You alone are strong enough to do that. Why do you want us to be here too?”</p> <p>“The more people, the better! Isn’t that right?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing shrugged and said, “Alright, you’re the boss. Whatever you say!”</p> <p>In the bedroom, Lin Wenwen was in deep thoughts with a slight frown.</p> <p>“What are you thinking about? Your eyebrows are knitting together.” Sitting on the couch, Long Qingying looked at Lin Wenwen and asked while carefully wiping her katana with a piece of cloth.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen sighed and said, “Maybe me staying here will truly cause Tianxing some unnecessary troubles. I’m thinking that I was too stubborn when I decided to stay here. But, I’m struggling. I want to stay close to him, and see him.”</p> <p>Long Qingying fixed her eyes on the sharp edge of her blade while responding, “As long as you’re aware that you were self-willed… As an outsider, I think if you really like him, you shouldn’t bring him any troubles. You’re a mature woman now, not a hotheaded seventeen-year-old little girl.”</p> <p>While speaking, she stood her katana up before her eyes, carefully staring at its edge.</p> <p>After blowing on the blade, she continued, “You want to be around him, but you also need to think about the situation. At this time, you should leave with Lin Feng and the others. Even fighting against zombies over there is better than dealing with those complicated people here. After all, we’re outsiders. You think those people will be nice to us? Think about that kid and his mother whom we met that day, then you’ll figure it out.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded. Ever since that day, she didn’t dare to wear dresses again, but always wore jeans in this base.</p> <p>She thought that the people in this base would show some respect to them, because they were working together with Wu Chengyue. However, she found that she was wrong. She and her friends were here to seek help, and weren’t invited here. So, the Sea City Base people hadn’t been putting them on their equal footing.</p> <p>Under different circumstances, they would be treated in different ways. They were in other people’s place, so they had to bow.</p> <p>She blamed herself, as she hadn’t learned to deal with her current situation yet. It might also be because her big sister protected her so well before.</p> <p>At this moment, her sanity was fighting against her feelings. She told herself that she should leave Sea City Base as soon as possible, and that it was good for everyone. However, at the same time, her feelings didn’t allow her to leave Yuan Tianxing. Although Yuan Tianxing never responded to her emotionally, she still wanted to be close to him.</p> <p>If only her big sister was here… Her big sister would criticize her strictly, then directly kick her away instead of leaving her here struggling. She needed someone to make decisions for her, as she really couldn’t control herself.</p> <p>However, her big sister…</p> <p>Thinking of Lin Qiao, Lin Wenwen felt sad.</p> <p>But soon, she thought of that female zombie named Lu Tianyu. For some reason, the more time she spent with that zombie, the more she felt that the latter was like her big sister. Her handwriting, tone of speaking, some small movements, and the familiar presence… all these made her feel that her sister was with her.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen often wondered why Lu Tianyu had been helping her family and her.</p> <p>“Qingying, do you think my big sister… really died?” She abruptly asked Long Qingying with confusion.</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at Lin Wenwen, also confusedly. “What do you mean?” she asked, “I think Chief is very strong. Maybe she didn’t die. She was defeated, but still had a great chance of survival. In fact, I never believed that she’s dead. Perhaps, she’ll come back someday.”</p> <p>“If she didn’t die, has she already come back…” said Lin Wenwen unsurely.</p> <p>“Maybe,” Long Qingying responded without paying too much attention to Lin Wenwen’s words.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At this moment, Xiao Yunlong’s car was driven into the yard of Wu Chengyue’s place.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong opened the car door and got off. As he walked into the living room, he saw Wu Chengyue and Meng Yue sitting there, seeming to be talking about leaving the base to collect supplies.</p> <p>“You’re back! It’s quite late, what took you so long? Have you had dinner?” Wu Chengyue raised his head and looked at Xiao Yunlong as he asked.</p> <p>“I haven’t had dinner yet,” Xiao Yunlong replied, “I lingered over there to learn about their future plans before returning.”</p> <p>“Have they decided on the location? Are they ready to start the construction?” Wu Chengyue quickly asked.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong shook his head and said, “The construction work hasn’t started yet, but the location has been determined. They plan to build the fence wall of the central area first. I guess they won’t officially start the construction until Yuan Tianxing is there.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded, as if he had foreseen this. “I thought so.”</p> <p>At that point, Xiao Licheng abruptly rushed in and said to the people in the living room, “Chief, something happened in the research institute. Doctor Liang was killed by a grenade.”</p> <p>“What did you say?” Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong both looked at him with surprise.</p> <p>“I just received the news,” said Xiao Licheng.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue immediately stood up and threw the files in his hands onto the table, then walked outside without saying anything. Xiao Licheng hurriedly picked up his coat and left with Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Meng Yue stood up from the couch as well. However, she didn’t follow behind the others, just watching them leave.</p>",
  "Chapter 350: Why Are You Here?": "<p>Soon after walking into the building, Lin Qiao felt that someone came in behind her. She turned back and saw a man and a walking onto the stairs.</p> <p>“Miss. Yan, you could have simply sent us to bring the message to those Hades Base people. Why did you come yourself?” The young man said to the tall, slim, and pretty lady before him.</p> <p>“Because I wanted to come here,” said Yan Fangyu, “I’m afraid you might not be able to make it clear.”</p> <p>The young man was a little speechless. “It’s just one message. How wrong can we possibly make it? You’re lying. You’re here to see their handsome Deputy Chief,” he said.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu glanced back at him and said, “You don’t have to say it out loud.”</p> <p>“Lady, you can like anyone, but why did you fall for an outsider?” said the young man, “There are so many great men in our base. You’re going to make them despair!”</p> <p>While walking, Yan Fangyu turned back and rolled her eyes toward the young man, then responded, “That’s my business. Even if I didn’t fall for an outsider, I wouldn’t take a fancy to those men in our base.”</p> <p>“Why?” The young man was confused.</p> <p>“No reason,” said Yan Fangyu, “Maybe love hasn’t arrived yet.” After saying that, she winked at the young man.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was going to turn herself visible. However, as those two walked up while chatting, she had no choice but to stay invisible. She stood aside and waited until they had gone upstairs, then followed behind them.</p> <p><em>‘Who’s this woman? She actually fancies our Tianxing! But, I’ve already decided to save him for my little sister </em>,’ thought Lin Qiao as she followed the two to Lin Wenwen’s door and saw Wei Jingchen and Xing Le guarding by the door across the hallway.</p> <p>“Eh? Why are you guarding here? Are you protecting Miss. Lin?” Yan Fangyu asked with surprise.</p> <p>“Miss. Yan, good to see you! Are you here to see our Deputy Chief?” Xing Le nodded at the two and asked.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu smilingly nodded and said, “Yeah, I’m here to see him.”</p> <p>“Wait a moment,” Wei Jingchen responded, then turned around. He knocked on the door before opening it and shouting toward the living room, “Boss, Deputy Chief Yan is here to see you.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and Du Yuanxing paused for a second, then glanced at each other. “Why is she here?” asked Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing shrugged and said, “Ask her.”</p> <p>“Let her in,” said Yuan Tianxing toward the door. Then, Yan Fangyu and one of her subordinates walked in.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu gave Yuan Tianxing a very warm smile while greeting him, “Good evening, Deputy Chief Yuan!”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and Du Yuanxing both stood up. The former pointed at a couch and replied with a polite smile, “I said, don’t call me Deputy Chief. Please take a seat. Is there anything important that made you come here so late at night?”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu sat down, her subordinate standing at a meter behind her.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing turned around and poured her a glass of water, then placed it on the tea table before her.</p> <p>“Ah, I’m here to tell you to be careful,” said Yan Fangyu, “Especially the two girls among you… They have been targeted by one of the three leaders of this base. I think you won’t be able to bring them out of this base easily now even if you want to. Also, you guys might get into troubles as well. So, you should better raise your vigilance.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing gave a faint smile and responded, “Ugh, if you’re talking about Yang Chao who has eyes on Lin Wenwen, we’ve already known about that. We do plan to leave as quickly as possible.”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu looked at him with surprise and said, “Eh? How did you find out about that so quickly? Not many people knew about it. Has someone else delivered the message to you?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing showed her a meaningful smile while answering her questions, “You’re right. Some other people visited us before you. But, I’m surprised that you came here too. It’s quite late now.”</p> <p>Yan Fangyu didn’t care about what he said. Keeping that confident smile on her face, she said, “Huh, are you saying that what I’m doing now is unnecessary? I came here late at night to tip you off, and you’re not going to thank me?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and said, “How can I possibly mean that? I didn’t say anything like that.”</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Wenwen opened the door of the bedroom just far enough to look out, then asked a question to Long Qingying, who was behind her, with surprise.</p> <p>“Qingying, who’s that woman outside?”</p> <p>Long Qingying put the piece of cloth which she had been wiping her blade with on the table, then put the blade back into the sheath. After that, she put the blade on a chair and stood up to walk toward the door.</p> <p>She looked outside from behind Lin Wenwen, then said, “I don’t know, but I can recognize the way she looks at Deputy Chief. It seems that your rival in love has shown up.”</p> <p>“Em, I felt it,” Lin Wenwen nodded and said. The look in her eyes was a little inexplicable.</p> <p>The two of them closed the door but left it unlocked, then quietly listened to the conversation happening in the living room. Soon, they discovered that the pretty woman outside actually came here with the same purpose as Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>Long Qingying frowned and said, “Quite some people are minding others’ business tonight. This woman is clearly here for Deputy Chief, but who were those men here for?”</p> <p>Hearing her words, Lin Wenwen suddenly had a thought in her head. She turned to Long Qingying and said, “Eh, that man who came earlier is named Lu Tianyi, and Miss. Lu is named Lu Tianyu. After hearing what you said, I suddenly feel that there might be a connection between the two of them!”</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at her and also gave a start.</p> <p>Yan Fangyu didn’t linger for long. After learning that some other people had delivered the message before her, she had a short casual chat with Yuan Tianxing, then left with her subordinate, wearing her ten-centimeter tall heels.</p> <p>Those high heels didn’t cause any difficulty for her in walking. Among all women in this base, only she wore super high heels every single day. She walked stably and quickly with those heels, without being extra careful at all.</p> <p>Of course, anyone who attempted to bully her because she was wearing heels would suffer.</p> <p>After the beautiful Yan Fangyu had left, Lin Wenwen and Long Qignying came out of the bedroom.</p> <p>“Who’s that pretty lady?” Lin Wenwen sat on a couch and asked curiously.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing responded, “Ah, a Deputy Chiefs of this base.”</p> <p>“She’s a Deputy Chief?” said Lin Wenwen with surprise, “No wonder she has such a strong vibe. It turns out that she’s a leader. She’s so pretty. She must have so many suitors, and those shouldn’t be ordinary men.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing was immediately attracted by this topic. “Yeah, I heard that if the men in this base who are pursuing her lined up, the line would extend from here to an entrance of the base. She’s like the goddess in this base, and she’s single.”</p> <p>“You’re drooling,” said Long Qingying.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing gave her a wicked glance and said, “Hehe, are you jealous?”</p> <p>Long Qingying rolled her eyes and said, “Psycho! What to be jealous of? No matter how many men are pursuing her right now, she’ll eventually be with only one man.”</p> <p>At that point, Lin Wenwen was thinking about another question—what was the relationship between Lu Tianyu and Lu Tianyi? Lu Tianyu was from Sea City Base, but why didn’t she go home since she came back here? Are there people in this base who know her?</p>",
  "Chapter 351: I Am Going to Make A Trouble": "<p>“So that’s the woman who has been bringing troubles to you.” Suddenly, a hoarse voice was heard.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing, Du Yuanxing, Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying all turned to the source of the voice and saw a woman standing there, wearing a hat and a pair of sunglasses. None of them knew when she showed up.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took off her sunglasses, exposing her dark eyes and green pupils.</p> <p>Seeing her, Lin Wenwen said happily, “Ah, Miss. Lu, you’re back!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao smilingly nodded at her.</p> <p>The smile on Yuan Tianxing’s face turned much more real than before as he said, “Great, we’ll be able to leave here soon then.”</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “I’m afraid that we’ll have to stay here for a while.”</p> <p>Her words made the others pause shortly, then look at her with confusion.</p> <p>“Why?” asked Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“Because, a few people died tonight. A slight disorder will soon be stirred up in this base. It won’t take too long. I think some people will come to our doors tomorrow at dawn.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and the others glanced at each other with surprise. Unlike them, Yuan Tianxing blinked and asked, “You seem to know who died.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave a faint smile and said, “Of course! A Deputy Chief, a Chief’s little sister, and a researcher who had been studying the zombie virus. What do you think?” While speaking, she walked to the window and leaned against the frame while carefully looking outside.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and the others all had their expressions changed slightly. After that, they stared at Lin Qiao with both shock and doubt.</p> <p>“Why did they die? And… you shouldn’t show up now,” Lin Wenwen said with a frown.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing’s face darkened slightly. He hurriedly walked to the window and closed the curtain.</p> <p>“Wenwen is right. You showing up now will only make Yang Chao suspect you. Also, why did those people suddenly die? Yang Chao’s family should have been protected firmly. Who in this base can be bold enough to hurt his sister?” said Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>“I did it. I surely have nothing to be afraid of,” said Lin Qiao blandly.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen was quite delighted upon hearing about Yang Yan’s death. However, as Lin Qiao said that it was she who had killed those people, she gazed at her stunned just like the others.</p> <p>She suddenly didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing popped his eyes and yelled at Lin Qiao as if he was looking at a ghost, “Lady! You’re causing trouble!”</p> <p>“I am causing trouble!” Lin Qiao gave an evil grin, then shrugged and said carelessly, “Relax! Soon enough, someone will seize this opportunity to give Yang Chao difficulties. He won’t have the time for us anymore.”</p> <p>“Who?” The others asked in one voice.</p> <p>“Who’s his enemy?” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Wu Chengyue!” The people answered again with one voice.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Yuan Tianxing both thought quickly and immediately figured out Lin Qiao’s meaning.</p> <p>“The dead researcher was on Chief Wu’s side, wasn’t he? Is that why you said he’ll use this opportunity to hurt Yang Chao?” Lin Wenwen slightly widened her eyes and asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled and gave her a meaningful glance.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “If I were Wu Chengyue, I certainly wouldn’t miss this opportunity. Perhaps, Chief Wu had been holding some other thing over Yang Chao, and we just don’t know it yet.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “He’s a base leader after all. Even if there isn’t an opportunity, he’ll create one.”</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Wenwen looked at Lin Qiao and suddenly asked, “Just now, you mentioned about a woman bringing troubles. Were you talking about that woman who came here just now? Who does she bring troubles to?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao pointed at Yuan Tianxing and said, “Him. Or, should I say that it’s his debt of love? Do you know that because he was close with that woman, Yang Chao got jealous and intended to murder him? Earlier on, Yang Chao hired a group of robbers to ambush him on his way out of the base. I wonder where did he find that level-seven robber. Doesn’t he worry that the robber might turn against him?”</p> <p>Once she said that, the other three in the room all quietly gazed into Yuan Tianxing’s eyes.</p> <p>“… What does that have to do with me? I’m innocent, alright?” Yuan Tianxing explained.</p> <p>Suddenly, he remembered something. “Ugh, I almost forgot about it. I have something for you,” he looked at Lin Qiao and said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao curiously watched him walk out of this flat to the room across the hallway, then come back in a few minutes with a small box in his hand.</p> <p>“This is for you, from Wu Chengyue,” Yuan Tianxing handed the box to her.</p> <p>“From him? What is it?” asked Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing put the box in her hand and said, “Cosmetic contacts? I think he said so.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him with surprise and asked, “Why did he find these contacts for me?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing spread his hands and said, “How am I supposed to know? You should ask him yourself.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao opened the box bewilderedly and found that those cosmetic contacts were very well preserved.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Yang Chao had started searching through the entire base after he buried Yang Yan.</p> <p>“Yang Yan’s wounds seemed to have been caused by the teeth of wild beasts, and they were also seriously infected by the zombie virus. If her brain weren’t eaten, she would have become a zombie by now. Go and search the base. Not only has a zombie come in, even a zombie beast has made its way in.”</p> <p>Yang Chao stood in his living room, wearing a cold and grim look. His vibe spread in the room and raised the air pressure, making the group of people who were standing in front of him slow their breaths down.</p> <p>“Why are you all standing here? Go! Now! All of you!” As these people actually reacted slowly after receiving his order, Yang Chao immediately burst in shouts.</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” Most of those people shivered while responding, then turned and prepared to leave.</p> <p>“You two stay here, the others out.” Yang Chao suddenly pointed at two men and demanded them to stay, then said to them, “Go and gather all people who worked in the number one virus study group in the research institute.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!”</p> <p>Soon, when Yang Chao was left alone in his living room, Tang He walked out of a bedroom.</p> <p>“Are those zombies from your research institute?” he asked.</p> <p>Yang Chao glanced at him and said, “The research institute is the only place in this base where zombies existed. If a female zombie has shown up in the base, it must be from there. Besides, Liang Dashu has died, and his assistant has gone missing. The important files that he has might have been taken away. Moreover, that woman saw you. You better hide yourself, and don’t let Wu Chengyue find you. Or, we’ll both be in troubles.”</p> <p>Tang He responded carelessly, “I’d hide well even if you didn’t say so. Earlier on, you mentioned that those files are about how to cure the viral infection. Is that real?”</p>",
  "Chapter 352: Someone is Creating Troubles": "<p>Yang Chao glanced at him and said, “We’re on the same boat now. I have no reason to lie to you. It’s supposed to be a secret. I’m letting you know to show you how much I value our cooperation. Why are you still doubting me?”</p> <p>Tang He said, “Do you have any idea how to bring Wu Chengyue down?”</p> <p>Yang Chao looked at him and responded, “I plan to send you to catch that Hades Base woman, then turn her into a zombie, so that I’ll have an excuse to ask the residents of this base to banish him. However, you haven’t gotten me that woman yet.”</p> <p>Tang He gave him a meaningful glance, then shrugged and said, “Alright! You only want one Hades Base person. In fact, it can be any one of them, right? So, I can choose to kidnap that woman, or anyone else. I’m going right now. You should figure out a way to solve the problem of your research institute as soon as possible.”</p> <p>He knew that the research institute was run by Yang Chao. It was built by the three base leaders together, but currently, the people in charge there were all under his command. Therefore, he needed to take responsibility for any problem that happened there.</p> <p>Also, his sister was suddenly bitten to death at her own home. That was clearly revenge. Yang Chao must have been extremely sad and angry, and the cold and gloomy look on his face proved that.</p> <p>Tang He turned to leave, but abruptly stopped as he suddenly thought of something. He turned back around and looked at Yang Chao as he said, “There’s another thing. I’ve seen the zombie which attacked one of your subordinates. It was a female zombie, but there was one strange thing…”</p> <p>He paused for a second, then continued with both confusion and hesitation, “Quite some people were on the scene back then, but that female zombie only attacked that man and ignored the others. Why?”</p> <p>Yang Chao was puzzled at first, then looked at him and asked, “What did you say? That zombie can choose its target?”</p> <p>Tang He nodded and said, “I think so. I don’t know which level it was at.”</p> <p>Yang Chao frowned as he kept looking at him and asking questions, “Couldn’t you sense its level? What was it like?”</p> <p>Tang He shook his head and answered his questions, “I didn’t see clearly. But, its hair were long, so it was definitely a female zombie.”</p> <p>Yang Chao fell into silence with a frown; Tang He couldn’t tell what he was thinking.</p> <p>Having finished talking, Tang He turned and left. Soon, the two men who were sent to find the people from the study group came back in haste.</p> <p>“Chief, something bad has happened. All number one study group people have gone missing.”</p> <p>The look on Yang Chao’s face instantly changed, as he was slightly surprised. He looked at his two subordinates and asked, “What? How can they be missing? Where did they go?”</p> <p>The two men replied while sweating, “Their apartment was empty when we got there. We asked their neighbors, but no one saw them going back.”</p> <p>Yang Chao soon calmed back down, but his face was much darker than before. “Send more people and find them!” he said.</p> <p>“Yes, sir!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>While Yang Chao was alarmed because his researchers were missing, Wu Chengyue and his people arrived at the destroyed laboratory and saw the messy scene, as well as the two bodies.</p> <p>“Chief, Piao Gecang’s energy nucleus was taken away,” Xiao Licheng put on a pair of white gloves and quickly checked the scene, then turned back to report to Wu Chengyue, “Also, he was heavily infected by the zombie virus. There’s a bite mark on his arms. I think he was bitten by a zombie before death.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue had no expression upon hearing his words. He quietly gave a few glances at Liang Dashu’s body, then said, “Bury Doctor Liang properly, and keep an eye on those researchers. Don’t let Yang Chao find them.”</p> <p>Beside him, a squad leader quickly nodded and said, “Yes, sir. You, carry Doctor Liang out!”</p> <p>Then, Wu Chengyue walked up behind Xiao Licheng who was squatting on the ground, and looked at Piao Gecang’s body that was lying before him as he said, “His skull was removed. Whoever did it, they obviously did it for the nucleus. But how could he be bitten by a zombie? Did one of those escape?”</p> <p>While speaking, he turned around to look at those glass zombie containers outside.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong shook his head and said, “I’ve just checked. No zombie is missing. The zombie which bit Piao Gecang isn’t from here.”</p> <p>“Where is it from then?” said Wu Chengyue with confusion.</p> <p>After thinking for a moment, he abruptly turned to Xiao Yunlong and continued, “Did she come back here? Didn’t you say that she had left before you?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong nodded to agree, “It’s possible. But, she said that she had something to do on her way back, so she might arrive later. Even if she’s back, we wouldn’t know, because she likes to stay invisible.”</p> <p>“Chief, Piao Gecang was bitten in a residential area in Region D, then ran all the way here. We don’t know why he came here, but he did run into Doctor Liang. Or, was he here to see Doctor Liang on purpose?” Xiao Licheng stood up and turned his eyes to Wu Chengyue from Piao Gecang’s body as he said.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue blinked, then nodded and replied, “It’s possible. But, why did she send out a zombie to bite Piao Gecang?”</p> <p>As his head was full of puzzles, a soldier quietly ran in from the outside and whispered a few words to the ear of his squad leader. Then, that squad leader wore a serious look.</p> <p>“Chief!” The squad leader quickly walked to Wu Chengyue’s side and said, “Yang Yan just died very miserably. Yang Chao is in rage… He shredded the few superpowered men who were responsible for her safety with wind.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at him with surprise while saying, “She died? Miserably how?”</p> <p>“Her head and one arm were bitten off,” said the squad leader, “seemingly by some kind of zombie beast. Yang Chao’s people failed to find even a trace of the attacker. Now, he has sent out a large number of people to search through the entire base.”</p> <p>“Head and one arm… Miserable indeed! It must be revenge! Without a doubt, it was her who did that. No one else can kill someone like that without leaving a trace. And, there’s actually a zombie beast. She doesn’t have a zombie dog as a pet, does she?” Wu Chengyue thought for a moment, then guessed out who had the power to achieve that.</p> <p>“Besides, Yang Yan offended Lin Wenwen not long ago. Maybe she killed her because of Lin Wenwen, or maybe, she wants to destroy Yang Chao like us. But, this is…” While speaking, he showed a bitter look and continued, “Why can’t she stay as a nice zombie? Now, she has made a series of troubles in our base. Even though she has been messing with Yang Chao, and happened to create an opportunity for us, our base would become chaotic if she continues creating troubles like this.”</p> <p>This time, Xiao Yunlong, Xiao Licheng and the others all figured out whom he was talking about. Thinking about that female zombie’s style of doing things and her power, they all fell into silence. Somehow, they felt that a storm was coming, and that someone was definitely creating troubles!</p>",
  "Chapter 353: Moli’s Power": "<p>At night, the soldiers in the base began searching door to door. A turmoil was stirred up in every region, and the people were jittery; many couldn’t sleep well the whole night.</p> <p>However, Yang Chao’s people failed to find any suspicious people even after spending the whole night searching.</p> <p>Moli was hiding in a dark corner, watching those soldiers walk about.</p> <p>She hid next to a wall. As a squad passed by, she quietly followed behind them. When the squad was getting around the corner, she abruptly covered the mouth of the last soldier, put an arm around his neck, and dragged him backward.</p> <p>The soldier was dragged into a corner before he could react, then heard Moli’s cold voice saying, “Sleep, you can stop searching.”</p> <p>Once Moli said that, the soldier dropped his eyelids and actually fell asleep. He had no idea what he was doing.</p> <p>Moli carefully observed around. After finding nothing suspicious, she quickly ripped off the soldier’s clothes and put them on.</p> <p>As she stood up after putting on the soldier’s clothes and hat, her body suddenly began growing taller, and her face started shifting shape. Soon, she became exactly like that soldier.</p> <p>She carried the soldier’s rifle and quickly ran out of the corner, catching up with the squad.</p> <p>“Hurry up! Where have you been?” The squad leader seemed to have sensed that one of them was missing. He turned back to look at his squad members and saw Moli catching up.</p> <p>“I had to pee!” said Moli.</p> <p>She looked like a man, and her voice was a man’s voice now. No one could tell her true identity.</p> <p>She didn’t want to follow this squad. However, as the searchers in the base had all been taking actions in squads, she would look very suspicious if she acted alone.</p> <p>She followed this squad for a while, then switched to another squad. Sometimes, she would hide in dark places and sneakily move toward Wu Chengyue’s place.</p> <p>By the time she made it to Wu Chengyue’s place with some real efforts, she only saw Meng Yue.</p> <p>“Who are you?” Meng Yue looked at the soldier who suddenly pushed the door open and walked in, speaking with a tough attitude.</p> <p>A base leader lived in this building, so the soldiers wouldn’t normally come in without an order, meaning that a stranger soldier coming into this place wasn’t normal.</p> <p>“It’s me,” said the male soldier with a woman’s voice. In the next moment, Meng Yue witnessed that this soldier’s face suddenly changed, and even his body became shorter.</p> <p>Once Moli showed her face, Meng Yue hurriedly walked up to her and said, “Why are you here? Did those people hurt you? What happened to Doctor Liang?”</p> <p>Hearing Meng Yue mention Doctor Liang, Moli’s face darkened instantly. With sadness, she said, “It was Piao Gecang. He was bitten by a zombie. He suddenly came to our lab and asked the Doctor for a cure. And then, a level-seven stranger showed up, killing Piao Gecang. When he wanted to kill us too, Doctor threw out a grenade. So, he… died trying to protect me.”</p> <p>“What? Level-seven? Are you sure?” Meng Yue immediately wore a grave look.</p> <p>“He killed Piao Gecang within a blink,” said Moli, “Piao Gecang didn’t even have a chance to fight back. Besides, his power gave me the same pressure as what the three Chiefs have given me. If he’s not at level-seven, he should be only a breath away from it.”</p> <p>“There’s the fourth level-seven being hiding in our base. Who is he? What is he up to?” Meng Yue asked with a straight face.</p> <p>“I don’t know! But I believe he’s not a friend!” Moli shook her head, then asked anxiously, “Where’s the Chief? I need to report to him about something else!”</p> <p>“He went to the research institute. I don’t think he’ll be back soon. Also, after what happened, he might take some major actions toward Yang Chao. You stay here and wait for him to come back,” said Meng Yue.</p> <p>And so, she waited until the next morning.</p> <p>Next morning at dawn, all the important officials in Sea City Base were summoned for a meeting. Soldiers guarded all over the base, sentries at every three or five steps.</p> <p>In the morning, Lin Wenwen looked around the apartment but failed to find Lin Qiao. “Eh? Where’s Miss. Lu?” she asked.</p> <p>“No idea!” The others shook their heads and responded.</p> <p>She rolled her eyes, then gave a smile and said, “Alright, I need to go out today.”</p> <p>Hearing that, the others immediately turned to her with confusion.</p> <p>“You’re going out? Now? Where’re you going? You should stay here. What if something bad happened to you?” Yuan Tianxing said to her with a slight frown.</p> <p>The others nodded in agreement.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen walked to Yuan Tianxing and said, “Tianxing, I have a question for you. If… my sister didn’t die, but came back someday with a different look and identity, what will you do?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing paused for a moment, then looked at her silently. On his handsome face, that pair of smiling eyes now looked as deep and quiet as a lake. In about ten seconds, he slowly began talking. “No matter what she became, she’s always my boss. My squad only knows her as her soul. We don’t care about her appearance.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen’s eyes dimmed slightly, then a watery beam of light flashed across those eyes. She dropped her eyelids slightly, then re-lifted them.</p> <p>With a calm look, she said, “Me neither. So now, I’m going to find something out. No danger can stop me.”</p> <p>“Where are you going?” Yuan Tianxing looked at her curiously.</p> <p>“I don’t know. But, I think I won’t go too far,” Lin Wenwen thought for a moment and said.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and Du Yuanxing glanced at each other. They didn’t understand why Lin Wenwen wanted to go out.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen stared at Yuan Tianxing with a mysterious look in her eyes and said, “Tianxing, some people have been keeping secrets from us. So, we can only try finding out the truth by ourselves. Besides, I guess Yang Chao has no time to bother me today!”</p> <p>“What are you trying to find out? And what does that have to do with your sister?” asked Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>“Whether it’s related to my sister or not will depend on the result,” said Lin Wenwen. After saying that, she turned and walked to the door. “Qingying, let’s go!”</p> <p>Hearing her, Long Qingying carried her katana and followed Lin Wenwen out.</p> <p>At that moment, Yuan Tianxing said to Du Yuanxing, “Yuanxing, you go with them. Wenwen might be right. The important people in this base now have no time to mind us, so it’s relatively safer for her to go out now. You and Qingying should be able to handle most of the problems. Stay on alert!”</p> <p>“Yes, sir,” Du Yuanxing glanced at him, then stood up and nodded. After that, he walked out of the door and followed Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying downstairs.</p>",
  "Chapter 354: She has Become Different": "<p>Du Yuanxing caught up with the two girls and asked, “What do you want to find out?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen was walking before him. She didn’t answer his question, but asked another one, “Du Yuanxing, do you know who in this base have contact with Miss. Lu?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing was puzzled for a moment, then stopped walking and asked with surprise, “Eh? Do you plan to ask around about Miss. Lu?”</p> <p>Long Qingying also looked at her while saying, “Based on what you said earlier, does Miss. Lu have something to do with Chief?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded and said uncertainly, “I have some thoughts and guesses, all of which need to be confirmed.”</p> <p>“Why don’t you just ask her? Why ask around behind her back?” said Long Qingying with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen shook her head and said, “She won’t tell. Otherwise, she wouldn’t get close to us with her current identity.”</p> <p>Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing confusedly glanced at each other, without understanding Lin Wenwen’s meaning.</p> <p>What identity? Did she have other identities?</p> <p>Long Qingying abruptly looked around, then said with a weird look, “Do you think she might be following right behind us now? She always shows up suddenly and then disappears. And now, we’re talking about her…”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen responded with a calm look, “She isn’t here. I think she’s now watching the show which is being staged by the important people in this base. She loves doing these kinds of things. Isn’t Chief Wu preparing to start some disturbance?”</p> <p>Long Qingying and Du Yuanxing looked at her bewilderedly and asked in one voice, “How do you know?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen shrugged and said, “I guessed.” While speaking, she turned and prepared to keep walking.</p> <p>At that point, Du Yuanxing finally couldn’t hold it back anymore, “Um… If you only want to know about Miss. Lu, I actually know it all. You don’t need to ask around. If you really want to know, I can tell you.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen stopped walking, then turned back and gazed at him with surprise as she asked, “You know? Really?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing nodded and replied, “In fact, she’s pretty famous…”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen walked up to him, eagerly holding his arm and going downstairs. After that, she paused to look around, then dragged him to besides a window in a corner.</p> <p>“Why didn’t you say it earlier? Who is she? What have you heard about her?”</p> <p>Long Qingying came down and stood beside Lin Wenwen, also looking at Du Yuanxing with curiosity.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing glanced around to confirm that no one else was here. After that, he said, “Eh… She’s quite well-known, but her reputation isn’t good.”</p> <p>“Why? Is there a reason?” asked Lin Wenwen curiously.</p> <p>“Eh, I heard that she used to be a commoner,” said Du Yuanxing, “She relied on men and survived by using her beauty and body. Also, she was evil, and admired vanity. People said that she has done many bad deeds. After becoming Yang Chao’s lover, she did lots of bad things in this base, and pissed many people, off also causing Yang Chao tons of troubles. Therefore, Yang Chao dumped her, maybe because he was tired of her or because she was too old for him.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying made eye contact in shock. They couldn’t have thought that Miss. Lu used to be a person like that!</p> <p>“How can it be possible? According to what you said, she should be a disgusting woman. But, I think Miss. Lu is quite nice. She’s nothing like what you said,” said Long Qingying confusedly.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing quickly nodded in agreement, “Yeah, Deputy Chief and I were both shocked when we learned about it. We couldn’t believe it either. We actually thought that whom we’ve heard about was another person, but not her.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen fell into deep thoughts. A short while later, she said, “So, she’s completely different from before, right?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing nodded and said, “Yes. She has become a totally different person. I heard that she died because… Eh-hem, because she had her eyes on Chief Wu. Yang Chao encouraged her to kidnap the little princess, and she somehow really did that.”</p> <p>After hearing that, both Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying wore a weird expression.</p> <p>“That was really suicidal! Did she use her space to kidnap the little princess?” Long Qingying guessed.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing shook his head and said, “No. She was a commoner before. She didn’t have any superpower. If she did have a space, she wouldn’t need to depend on her face and body to live.”</p> <p>Long Qingying nodded and said, “You’re right!”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing continued, “I bet you can’t imagine what she did later. I heard that she… eh-hem, she raped Chief Wu. After that, Chief killed her outside. I guess that’s why she became a zombie…”</p> <p>Saying the last sentence, he lowered his voice and glanced around with a strange look.</p> <p>“Wait, wait a moment! What did you say?” Lin Wenwen hurriedly interrupted him with confusion, “What? What do you mean by she raped Wu Chengyue?”</p> <p>Long Qingying also popped her eyes and stared at Du Yuanxing with a meaningful look.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing hurriedly shushed Lin Wenwen, then said, “Shh, don’t say it so loud! Actually, many people here know about it. But still, don’t just say it out loud, for the sake of Chief Wu’s reputation!”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen responded with a complicated feeling, “So technically, she killed herself, right? Was it really Chief Wu who killed her? Is he such kind of person? Even though she raped her, I don’t think he’d hate her to the point of killing her, would he?”</p> <p>“Em, about that, there seems to be some other inside information,” said Du Yuanxing, “But, we didn’t try to dig for more details, as we don’t want to offend Chief Wu. Now, we’ve all seen that the little princess is safely at home. So, we also think that he wouldn’t truly kill Miss. Lu.”</p> <p>“I doubt that,” said Long Qingying expressionlessly, “Rapists can be both male or female. Being a woman doesn’t mean that she can be forgiven for doing something like that. She shouldn’t have raped him.”</p> <p>“Hah… Why do I want to laugh while hearing what you said?” Du Yuanxing looked at her and said with laughter.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded and said, “She’s right though.”</p> <p>After that, Long Qingying added, “Ugh, so according to what you just said, she and Wu Chengyue are enemies, aren’t they? But, why does it seem like nothing has been going on between them?”</p> <p>If she were the woman who had kidnapped his daughter and raped him, how could he possibly cooperate with her and her friends so peacefully like they had been doing now?</p> <p>Du Yuanxing answered her question, “Ah, I guess it’s because she looks very different now. I think Wu Chengyue hasn’t recognized her yet. I heard that she used to wear very thick makeup, and that she only wore miniskirts in the base. She liked to expose her long and white legs and hang around in the base in high heels. She was a woman who loved to dress up. Compared to what she looks now… Eh, I guess she does look like a different person now. Maybe the others didn’t recognize her either.”</p>",
  "Chapter 355: She Has Confirmed": "<p>Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying tried to imagine the current Lu Tianyu wearing really thick makeup, walking in front of them in a miniskirt, and her taking the pleasure underneath men with exaggerated expressions. Soon, they both couldn’t help but shake their heads, feeling that something strange had gotten into their minds.</p> <p>“So, are you still going out to ask around?” asked Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen shook her head and said, “You’ve told me all. Why would I still go out? Let’s head back. I already have the answer I wanted.”</p> <p>“What answer?” Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying looked at her confusedly.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen gave a mysterious smile, then said, “You’ll soon find out. Let’s go back.” Before Long, Yuan Tianxing, who had been standing behind the window and waiting to watch the three leave the residential area, heard the door open.</p> <p>He turned to the look at the three who came back after leaving for less than ten minutes.</p> <p>“Eh? Aren’t you going out? Why did you come back?” he asked with surprise.</p> <p>“We’re not going anymore,” Lin Wenwen smiled. After saying that, she went back into her bedroom, leaving Yuan Tianxing staring at the other two bewilderedly.</p> <p>Long Qingying also went back into the bedroom. She closed the door, then looked at Lin Wenwen and asked her, “Why do you want to know about Miss. Lu? And earlier on, you and Deputy Chief mentioned our Chief. Does this have something to do with her? Have you found something?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen leaned against the window and slightly raised her head to look at the clouds outside. She was wearing a relaxed smile, as if she was relieved about something.</p> <p>Hearing Long Qingying’s question, Lin Wenwen turned back and smiled at her, “Maybe I have. Perhaps, you’ll know when the time comes.”</p> <p>She didn’t tell Long Qingying about what she had just confirmed.</p> <p>As she refused to tell, Long Qingying didn’t ask any further questions, but looked at her with a meaningful expression and said, “I didn’t think that Miss. Lu used to be that kind of person. She’s completely different from the person that Du Yuanxing just told us about. Could he be wrong?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen turned around and looked at her as she said, “I don’t think so. If he even couldn’t get these things right, he should quit.”</p> <p>Long Qingying thought for a moment, then replied, “You’re right though. But, did Miss. Lu really… do those things?”</p> <p>“Maybe,” Lin Wenwen looked at her and said. <em>‘Because that was the old her, and not the current her.’</em></p> <p>A person died, then woke up as a zombie which had memories and a soul. Also, her personality and behavior had changed, which made her like a different being. If she hadn’t been pretending, she must have become another being.</p> <p>There were plenty of ways for someone to become a different person. When a person spent too much time pretending to be someone else, he or she might forget about his or her true nature; the influences came from other people, and spirit stimulations such as hypnotherapy could also change a person.</p> <p>The third way was the change of soul. A person would become someone else when his or her soul was replaced.</p> <p>Even zombies were talking now. What could be impossible?</p> <p>For now, Lin Wenwen only believed in the third possibility—Lu Tianyu’s soul had been replaced by her sister, Lin Qiao’s.</p> <p>Otherwise, why would she come all the way to save and help the Lin Family people, whom she wasn’t supposed to know? And, why did she use cooperation as an excuse to build them a new base, and ordered those high-leveled zombies to protect them?</p> <p>Lin Wenwen also believed that no other people could have the same presence, habits, and talking style as her sister did.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen now felt that her sister had come back. She only suspected about this before, but after hearing Du Yuanxing’s words, she had confirmed her guess.</p> <p>Suddenly, Long Qingying stared at her confusedly and asked, “Wenwen, why are you crying?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen came back to her senses and wiped her face, finding it to be wet.</p> <p>“Nothing. I was just thinking about something.” She wiped her face again and smiled. However, Long Qingying still looked at her suspiciously.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen seemed to have relieved and calmed down. She smiled faintly and said, “Why are you looking at me? I’m thinking that maybe we should leave. I wonder if Miss. Lu has watched enough of the show.”</p> <p>“Where to?” said Long Qingying.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen responded with, “To our own place. This place belongs to other people. It’s unsettling to stay here, as we always need to be extra careful.”</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at her, then nodded and said, “So, you should stay here and not go anywhere else.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen glanced at her and replied, “I don’t plan too.”</p> <p>“Good then!” Long Qingying nodded.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao, who was watching a show according to Lin Wenwen, was now in a super huge conference hall in an administration building in the central area. The tables in the conference hall are arranged in a door shape, three rows with three distinct groups of people sitting in three directions.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was sitting in the middle. Xiao Yunlong, Meng Yue, Moli, Xiao Licheng and his other subordinates were sitting behind him. On the left was Yang Chao and a level-six Deputy Chief. The seat by his left side was empty. Zou Shihui was sitting on the right; he looked about the same age as Wu Chengyue. Among the three base leaders, he was neither the youngest nor the oldest.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was the youngest one among the three, but was also the most powerful one. Behind him were one level-six vice-leader, Chen Yuting as the reserve Deputy Chief, Moli, Meng Yue, Xiao Licheng, and about twenty other level-five superpowered ones. In terms of military power, neither Yang Chao nor Zou Shihui could match him.</p> <p>Yang Chao had two level-six men under his command. The dead Piao Gecang was never a capable subordinate, and he had recently gotten himself killed. Currently, Yang Chao only had one level-six subordinate left, and less than ten level-five subordinates.</p> <p>One elderly man and a lady were sitting by Zou Shihui’s sides, both at level-six.</p> <p>The lady was Yan Fangyu, the goddess of this base; and the gray-haired old man had a wrinkled face, wearing a thick pair of presbyopic glasses.</p> <p>Sitting behind Zou Shihui were Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming. Kong Qingming was wearing a green army suit while Lu Tianyi was in a white robe, looking like a researcher.</p> <p>All base leaders and vice-leaders on the scene were wearing black army suit. The people at level-five or below were in green army suits or other types of uniforms. Including superpowered administrators and technicians from all three sides, about forty people were sitting in this conference hall.</p> <p>At this moment, the atmosphere in the conference hall was a little depressing. Except for those leaders and vice-leaders, all the others had their heads slightly lowered, hardly daring to breathe.</p> <p>The people on Yang Chao’s side all looked a little unconfident and panicked.</p>",
  "Chapter 356: The Conference Hall in the Base": "<p>Yang Chao was the only one who sat there with perfect composure, as if he had nothing to do with all this. It also seemed like he had already made some decisions, so he no longer cared what other people thought.</p> <p>Zou Shihui was neither handsome nor ugly. He wouldn’t impress one at first sight, but after talking a few more glances at him, one would find that he was rather pleasant to look at, and had a lingering charm.</p> <p>He also had a calm and settled vibe which belonged to mature men. His eyes contained a composed and peaceful look, yet seemed to be able to see through many things.</p> <p>He glanced at Yang Chao, then at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>“We have all received the news about what happened last night. Now, my dear Chiefs, do you have something to say?” As the two powerful ones remained silent, Zou Shihui had no choice but to start a peaceful conversation.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue responded with a faint smile, “Zou, you do the talking. You have all the files.”</p> <p>Zou Shihui looked at him, then took a glance at the others in the conference hall, especially casting a glance at Yang Chao. As the latter showed no change of expression, he nodded, picked up the files on the desk, and started talking, “Alright! First of all, the death of Deputy Chief Piao Gecang… According to the information that we have collected, Piao Gecang was killed in revenge. The murderer is a zombie. Three days ago, Piao Gecang ordered his subordinates to kidnap a woman in our base. He raped and abused the victim, also encouraging his subordinates to gangrape her. The victim was a reserve Deputy Chief, Chen Yuting’s legal wife. Her name was Shen Yujen. When Chief Wu and his subordinates found Shen Yujen, she had fallen into unconsciousness, and been injected with zombie blood. By that time, she was already heavily infected. That, was the reason behind the revenge.”</p> <p>Zou Shihui paused for a moment, then turned over the page and continued, “The second thing… Last night at about nine o’clock, Piao Gecang was attacked by a zombie and infected by the virus. Afterward, he broke into a laboratory and started a quarrel with the leader of the second virus study group, Liang Dashu. After that, an explosion happened. For the record, Piao Gecang was killed by someone else before the explosion, and Liang Dashu was killed by the explosion. According to his assistant, Moli, who was on the scene, a stranger at level-six or seven showed up at that time and attempted to kill them. For that reason, Liang Dashu detonated the grenade.</p> <p>After saying that, he looked at Wu Chengyue and said, “Chief Wu, please bring them in.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded, then glanced at Xiao Licheng who was behind him. The latter immediately stood up and walked out of the conference hall.</p> <p>The others quietly waited. Two minutes later, Xiao Licheng came back in with a group of people. Some of those people were dragged in, as each of them had lost a foot.</p> <p>Those were the group of criminals who were caught when Wu Chengyue and Lin Qiao had found Shen Yujen yesterday morning.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng sat back into his seat, then said with a serious look, “These are the criminals who were assaulting Shen Yujen when we found her. They have confessed that they did what they did under Piao Gecang’s orders. When we arrived there, they had already injected the zombie virus into the victim’s body. Report completed.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded at him as he finished talking.</p> <p>After Xiao Licheng finished his report, the others in the conference hall all stared at the group of criminals who were kneeling before their tables with sharp eyes.</p> <p>Zou Shihui blandly looked at them and asked, “Is that true? Do you have anything to say?”</p> <p>Those criminals had nothing to say. They all lowered their heads and stayed silent, seeming to be despairing. They probably knew that no matter what they said, the way it was going to end for them wouldn’t change.</p> <p>Zou Shihui waited for a short while. As they didn’t say a word, he continued, “This matter has been verified. The information given by Mr. Xiao has been confirmed to be true. The following six people, including Piao Gecang, Lin, Huang, and the other four, have violated the female protection regulations of our base, and injected the zombie virus into the victim, causing death to the victim, which is egregious. Now, according to the law of our base, the six of you will be sentenced to death. Execution: Firing squad. Time: Twelve noon today.”</p> <p>“Any objections?” After reading the verdict, he glanced at the others and asked. The people stayed silent to show their agreement.</p> <p>Zou Shihui continued, “Good, the verdict is now effective. Take them out.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” The soldiers who stood behind the group of criminals quickly stepped up and dragged out those rapists who were kneeling limply on the ground.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was still wearing a faint smile, with his lip corners slightly turned up. That was his symbolic expression, so no one could tell what he was thinking at this moment.</p> <p>Unlike him, Yang Chao’s face darkened a little. He couldn’t think of a word to say now. He was planning to claim that the zombie which killed Piao Gecang was brought into this base by Hades Base base people, and then make Wu Chengyue take the blame. However, not only did Wu Chengyue have witnesses, but he had also caught those rapists. Also, he strictly blocked the passages of information and didn’t let Yang Chao hear anything about that.</p> <p>Yang Chao was completely unprepared!</p> <p>What Piao Gecang did had nothing to do with him, but Piao Gecang was his subordinate. He had failed to manage his subordinates properly, so now, he couldn’t say anything.</p> <p>But still, he asked one question, “I want to ask a question. Shen Yujen was found by Chief Wu at last, but why did she turn into a zombie and attack Piao Gecang after that?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue put both elbows on the desk, his fingers crossed under his chin. He blandly glanced at Yang Chao, then responded with that smile, “Because we decided to respect the will of Chen Yuting, the victim’s husband. The remains of the victims have been handed to him. Is there a problem?”</p> <p>“Of course, there is!” said Yang Chao coldly, “If you cremated Shen Yujen’s body, she wouldn’t become a zombie and attack Piao Gecang in the base. Now, we don’t even know where she has been hiding. How many more people might she attack if this situation continues? Who will take responsibility for that?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue grinned and said, “Who will take the responsibility? I’m going to give you an answer. Without a question, Piao Gecang will, because this was his fault. Also, the security of the base if a part of your duty. You failed to locate the target, and you’re asking who’s gonna take the responsibility? Yesterday at noontime, Chen Yuting had taken Shen Yujen’s body out of the base. She had nothing to do with the base anymore, as she was outside. The potential safety hazard had been removed. As for why she became a zombie that night and made her way in, isn’t that your problem? After all, the security system of the entire base is under your administration.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s words had one simple meaning—’It’s your fault, all your fault. No matter how you try to explain, this is your fault! Since it’s your fault, what does it have to do with me?’</p> <p>“You…” Hearing that, Yang Chao choked on the words, and his face even turned bluish.</p>",
  "Chapter 357: Unknown People Have Crept In": "<p>“Em… If Shen Yujen was taken out of the base before she turned into a zombie, what happened last night had nothing to do with Chief Wu” Zou Shihui said, “As the victim’s husband, Chen Yuting had the right to bring her out instead of letting her stay in the base to hurt the others.”</p> <p>Zou Shihui wasn’t trying to help Wu Chengyue. Instead, he was telling the truth. Wu Chengyue was on the right side, so Yang Chao’s question didn’t affect him.</p> <p>That was why Yang Chao’s words only embarrassed himself.</p> <p>After thinking for a moment, Yang Chao said with a grim look, “My security measures are fine. There must be someone who sneakily brought the zombie in and a zombie beast. Your people and some foreigners have been coming in and out of the base these days, so I have the right to suspect you.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at him and said, “Chief Yang, you need to provide evidence when saying something like that. Or, you’re just smearing me.”</p> <p>“I will find the evidence and capture that female zombie,” Yang Chao snorted coldly.</p> <p>Zou Shihui glanced at the two of them. As Yang Chao had temporarily stopped talking, he said, “Now, we’ll talk the second thing. The reason why Piao Gecang went to the research institute after being bitten by the zombie is yet to be determined. However, he did come into conflict with Liang Dashu and Moli, who were both researchers. At last, an explosion happened in the laboratory. Now, one of the victims, Moli, will tell us about what happened back then.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned back to nod at Moli, and then the latter stood up and walked out. She walked to the empty space before the conference table, where a chair was placed.</p> <p>She sat on the chair, then straightened her waist and looked ahead as she started talking expressionlessly, “Last night, at twenty to ten, Doctor Liang and I were working in the underground laboratory. Piao Gecang suddenly rushed in. His face was pale, and he looked frenzied. Neither Doctor Liang nor I knew what had happened at that time, so we didn’t set up a defense against him. He seized an opportunity to hold me hostage and threaten Doctor Liang to give him the cure of the zombie virus. However, we haven’t developed any cure for the zombie virus, so we weren’t able to respond to Piao Gecang’s demand.”</p> <p>She paused for a moment, then continued, “But, I grasped a chance to throw him away with my combat skill when he was getting emotional and paying less attention to me. That’s how I freed myself out of his control. At that very moment, a powerful metal-powered stranger showed up, quickly killing Piao Gecang, who was under the attack of the zombie virus. As he prepared to kill Doctor Liang and me, the doctor detonated the grenade which was carried with him to protect the important research data and me, then died in the explosion.”</p> <p>Both Moli’s expression and tone of speaking was calm, but her eyes turned misty. However, she blinked hard and quickly stopped her tears.</p> <p>“That’s what happened last night before the explosion,” she said.</p> <p>While reading the files in his hand, Zou Shihui asked her, “Do you know which level that metal-powered stranger is at?”</p> <p>“My spirit power is at the middle stage of level-five, so it’s ineffective on the ones at the middle stage of level-six and above. Last night, I tried to attack him, but then found that he made no response to my attack at all. Based on that fact, I roughly concluded that he’s at the top of level-six, or has already stepped into level-seven.”</p> <p>Except for Wu Chengyue and the others who had already known about that, and Yang Chao who had been holding secrets, the others all had their expressions changed upon hearing Moli’s words, especially Zou Shihui.</p> <p>Zou Shihui paused shortly, then raised his head to look at Moli in the eyes and said, “Are you saying that person is at or nearly at level-seven?”</p> <p>That was a serious matter. Someone who was nearly as powerful as the three base leaders was hiding in their base, and had killed a researcher. Clearly, this person was here with no good intentions.</p> <p>What purpose did that person have? How did he enter the base?</p> <p>“Yes,” Moli nodded and responded certainly. After hearing that, Zou Shihui turned to nod at Wu Chengyue with a grim look.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at Moli and nodded at her, who quickly stood up from the chair, then walked back to her seat behind Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Zou Shihui then looked at Yang Chao and Wu Chengyue as he said, So, that metal-powered man is responsible for the death of both the researcher, Liang Dashu, and Piao Gecang. Where is this metal-powered man now? What purpose does he have? What does he want to do in our base?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue put his crossed fingers before his chin and said, “By far, no one knows what he is up to. We have to find him and ask him.”</p> <p>“Since he’s a level-six or seven powerful being, he can easily enter the base if he wanted to. But now, he is hidden somewhere, and it’s difficult for us to find him. Now, the most important thing is to find that female zombie and that zombie beast, and the one who let them in!” said Yang Chao with a cold voice.</p> <p>With those words, he seemed to be trying to change the topic and divert people’s attention.</p> <p>“Zombie beast? Chief Yang, you’ve mentioned a zombie beast earlier too. What made you believe that there’s a zombie beast in the base?” Zou Shihui looked at Yang Chao and asked confusedly.</p> <p>“Carry it in,” Yang Chao said to the Deputy Chief by his side.</p> <p>His Deputy Chief immediately stood up and uneasily glanced at Yang Chao, then turned and left.</p> <p>The people in the conference hall watched him leave. Not long after that, he came back in. A few people followed behind him, carrying an object which was covered in white cloth.</p> <p>The white cloth was heavily stained by blood. That object had the shape of the human body.</p> <p>The four people put the object on the ground, then one of them lifted the cloth.</p> <p>As people thought, they saw a bloody female corpse, with half a head and an arm missing.</p> <p>The people on the scene showed two different types of expressions when seeing the corpse. The ones who often left the base for missions stayed calmed and composed upon seeing that corpse, while those technicians who had spent five years under the base’s protection, and never went out to see corpses and zombies, had their faces paled the moment they saw the bloody corpse. They were both shocked and slightly frightened.</p> <p>Yang Chao pointed at that corpse and said, “You may not be able to recognize this victim, who has half a head and an arm missing. But I believe, many of you used to know her. She was my sister, Yang Yan. Last night, about nine o’clock, she suddenly disappeared for a few minutes. When she was found again, she had already become like this.”</p> <p>Hearing Yang Chao’s words, people’s expressions changed once again, becoming a little weird this time. Some people were even silently happy about Yang Yan’s death.</p>",
  "Chapter 358: Professional Trouble Maker": "<p>That woman was never a good person. She acted like a supercilious bully, all because she was a base leader’s little sister.</p> <p>She was known as a rude, unreasonable, and narrow-minded woman.</p> <p>She often took away the others’ merchandises in the markets without paying the owners anything in return, or paid with cheap stuff for valuable things.</p> <p>For anything that she had her eyes on, she would definitely find a way to get it. Usually, she would use only one method, which was violence. Thankfully, she wasn’t a man, or she would certainly hurt some female members in the base.</p> <p>Lu Tianyu was the woman whom Sea City Base people hated the most, and Yang Yan was the second most hated one.</p> <p>So now, many people were happy about her death. However, none of them showed their happiness in front of Yang Chao, only keeping that to themselves.</p> <p>Yang Chao had successfully distracted most of the people on the scene by showing them Yang Yan’s dead body. Zou Shihui, Wu Chengyue and a few others directly stood up from their seats and walked toward the corpse.</p> <p>“The wound on her head is clearly caused by beasts, and her arm was torn off. What killed her might well be a large zombie beast,” Zou Shihui walked to the corpse and squatted to check the wounds, then gave a conclusion.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stood behind him, his hands rested in his pockets. “That is correct,” he nodded in agreement.</p> <p>Zou Shihui stood up, then turned around to ask Yang Chao, “Have you seen the zombie beast which did this?”</p> <p>Yang Chao shook his head with a dark face and said, “She had already become like this when I got there. Her bodyguards all said that they saw nothing,”</p> <p>Zou Shihui made an eye-contact with Wu Chengyue, then said, “Then where did the zombie beast come from?”</p> <p>“Hehe, I don’t know where the zombie beast came from, but I do know how the level-seven superpowered man got in.” A hoarse voice was suddenly heard.</p> <p>The people turned to the source of the voice and saw a woman wearing a hat standing behind Wu Chengyue’s chair. No one knew when she showed up.</p> <p>Seeing her, everybody stood up.</p> <p>She wasn’t an administrator of the base, neither was a high-positioned being. However, she showed up right in their conference hall. If they were talking about something important, she would have heard it all.</p> <p>“Who are you!”</p> <p>“You!”</p> <p>“Who are you?”</p> <p>A few voices were heard simultaneously.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao wasn’t wearing her sunglasses. However, her eyes were no longer purely black like the eyes of zombies, but looked pale white with brown pupils. Those eyes didn’t make her look like a healthy human being, but definitely not made her look like a zombie.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at her with surprise. He was the one who said ‘You!’. The two who asked who she was were Yang Chao and Zou Shihui.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked up from behind the chairs, then introduced herself, “My last name is Lu. I came here with those Hades Base people. You don’t know about that level-seven metal-powered man, but I do. He’s a guest of our Chief Yang. But, I don’t know why Chief Yang has been acting like he knows nothing.”</p> <p>While speaking, she walked toward Yang Chao.</p> <p>“What are you talking about? Who are you? Is this place somewhere that you can come in without permission? Get out! Now!” Yang Chao was surprised to hear Lin Qiao’s words as he growled at her in panic.</p> <p>However, Wu Chengyue said to him in a bland tone, “Why are you nervous? Let me introduce her to you. This is Miss. Lu, my partner from Hades Base. She is also a founder of the new Hades Base.”</p> <p>After saying that, he turned around and spent a moment carefully staring at Lin Qiao’s face, his eyes showing a trace of confusion.</p> <p>But soon, he was given a headache.</p> <p><em>‘The female zombie is here to cause trouble! I think she’s specifically here to cause troubles, </em>‘ he thought.</p> <p>The leaders and senior administrators of Sea City had all learned that those Hades Base people were going to build a new base. However, they had rarely seen Lin Qiao, because she hardly ever showed her face. Unlike her, Lin Family people appeared on public occasions quite often.</p> <p>“I don’t care who she is. Irrelevant people should get out right now,” said Yang Chao coldly and fiercely.</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled calmly, “Why am I irrelevant? Didn’t you hear what I said? I’m a whistleblower now. I’m reporting you to the other leaders, because you’ve ganged up with a robber from the outside, and prepared to lead your base into a bloodbath.”</p> <p>“Shut up! I might cut off your tongue if you keep talking nonsense!” Yang Chao immediately growled at her and raised a hand. If Lin Qiao said one more word, he would truly make a move to cut off her tongue.</p> <p>“Wait a minute. Do you have evidence?” Zou Shihui hurriedly stepped forward to stop Yang Chao, then turned and asked Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “I don’t have evidence. But, you can ask him!” After saying that, she abruptly reached out a hand to point at a soldier in an army suit who was standing by the door.</p> <p>All the others turned to where she was pointing at.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed that man’s scent long ago. His disguise was useless to her.</p> <p>Normally, a man who had crept into a place that he wasn’t allowed in would be afraid of being found out. So, when he was pointed out in public, running away would be his first reaction.</p> <p>However, this soldier didn’t run.</p> <p>His expression froze for a moment when Lin Qiao pointed at her, but soon turned back normal. With a faint smile, he took off his hat.</p> <p>“Oops, you found me. I’m curious though. You had never seen me, so how did you recognize me? That woman has seen me, but even she didn’t recognize me.” Tang He took off his hat and showed his face. Holding the hat, he walked into the conference hall as he looked at Lin Qiao and said with curiosity. After saying that, he also pointed at Moli who was beside Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>“You! How dare you show up here!” Moli couldn’t maintain the cold expression on her face at the sight of Tang He. She pointed at him and burst into roars, her teeth clenched tightly.</p> <p>Tang He only chuckled and responded, “Why wouldn’t I dare to show up here? I am right here, so what can you do to me?”</p> <p>As Tang He showed up, the look on Yang Chao’s face changed. He pointed at Tang He and said, “Are you the unknown level-seven superpowered man? Why did you come to our base? What is your purpose?”</p> <p>Clearly, he said that to distance himself from Tang He. If Tang He told the others that they knew each other, he would have no choice but to pretend not to know him and claim that the other was lying.</p> <p>However, Tang He only gave him a meaningful glance and said, “I came here because I want to know if your secret experiment has succeeded or not.”</p> <p>His words made Yang Chao’s expression change drastically/</p> <p>Before Yang Chao said anything, Wu Chengyue, who was standing on the other side, asked with composure, “Experiment? Do you mean the experiment about injecting a small amount of diluted virus into the bodies of superpowered people to create a new, parasitic type of zombie?”</p> <p>What Wu Chengyue said gave Yang Chao a very bad feeling!</p> <p>Suddenly, a coldness appeared in his eyes as he gave a vicious shout, “Move!”</p>",
  "Chapter 359: Start The War Openly": "<p>Yang Chao gave a shout and suddenly swung an arm toward Wu Chengyue to launch a superpower attack. Raging gusts of wind suddenly broke the windows and blew in, roaring across the entire conference hall and rolling back out.</p> <p>The wind that Yang Chao created was at least force ten, like a typhoon passing over. Within a blink, all the tables, chairs, and other furnishings in the hall were raised by the wind, flying in the air.</p> <p>The people weren’t able to steady themselves under this violent wind, and all the commoners began staggering.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue had prepared himself for this after saying what he said, so he reacted swiftly. Once Yang Chao made a move, he raised an arm and created a dazzling line in midair.</p> <p>Following the rumbling thunder, lightning bolts descended from the sky. It flashed into the conference hall through the broken windows and gathered toward Yang Chao.</p> <p>On the other side of the hall, Zou Shihui remained standing steadily. As he waved a hand, the cement on the wall fell into pieces and gathered toward his people, soon forming into a cement wall that shielded the people behind him against the wind.</p> <p>“Yang Chao, you’ve really been colluding with outsiders! Are you planning to occupy the base for yourself?” His face darkened slightly as he growled at Yang Chao.</p> <p>Yang Chao stepped aside to dodge Wu Chengyue’s lightning bolts. After that, he stood straight, his long, black army coat fluttering in the wind.</p> <p>He sneered and said, “Since you have all known, I don’t need to pretend anymore now. That was exhausting. I am the owner of this base, and you… should all die!”</p> <p>After saying that, he pointed at Wu Chengyue and continued, “Wu Chengyue, I have had enough of you. Today, you can either get out of the base with your people or die here! Come out”</p> <p>As Yang Chao abruptly gave an order, a small part of the people behind him had their expressions changed. Their faces turned cold and twisted and their eyes popped, mouth widening and teeth bared.</p> <p>Some of the others calmly followed behind Yang Chao, and a few drew back to a corner with confusion and fright, glancing at Yang Chao and Wu Chengyue with puzzles in their eyes.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue said to Yang Chao blandly, “Yang Chao, we built the base together. It doesn’t belong to you alone. So, we won’t let you do this.”</p> <p>The wind was still blowing in the conference hall. The other superpowered people shielded the commoners and guided them to the corners of walls to take shelter from the wind. Soon, only Wu Chengyue, Yang Chao, Tang He, Zou Shihui and a few other powerful ones were left in the middle of the hall.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong, Yan Fangyu, and the other vice-leaders each took a few steps backward, standing behind their Chiefs.</p> <p>The people who sat in this conference hall had all made major contributions to the construction of this base. None of them was willing to give the base which was built up with their efforts to a man, even though he was a level-seven powerful being.</p> <p>“Yang Chao, the things that you’ve been doing behind our back are no good for the base. On the contrary, you are bringing harm to everyone else. You think injecting the diluted virus can lead to rapid growth of strength? Then, you should also know that the hosts will gradually lose their humanity!” Xiao Yunlong stood behind Wu Chengyue and pointed at Yang Chao as he yelled at him.</p> <p>Yang Chao looked at the others grimly. He had just found out that Wu Chengyue had already known about his secret experiment.</p> <p>“Was it you who kidnapped my researchers?” He waved a hand to calm the wind in the hall, then stared at Wu Chengyue and asked.</p> <p>“Yang Chao, did you get our permission to run that experiment? No wonder more and more members of this base went missing in the past few months. How dare you run experiments on the people in the base? Lunatic!” With a sullen look, Zou Shihui gazed at Yang Chao in the eyes while questioning him.</p> <p>Yang Chao gave a careless grin and responded, “You don’t understand. If my experiment succeeds, we’ll be having a powerful army, won’t we? By then, our base will expand into the largest base in this country, and the other bases will pay tribute to us with food and supplies. Won’t that be great?”</p> <p>With a sarcastic smile, Wu Chengyue said, “You have a large ambition, but too many unnecessary thoughts. Your body is healthy, but your brain isn’t.”</p> <p>“Hehe,” Yan Fangyu, who stood aside, was amused by Wu Chengyue’s words. She couldn’t help but cover her mouth and chuckle.</p> <p>“Be serious, there’s a fight!” The elderly man with a pair of glasses abruptly turned to say to her.</p> <p>“Eh-hem,” Yan Fangyu immediately erased the smile on her face and kept telling herself not to burst into undue laughter, and to stay serious, serious!</p> <p>Hearing Wu Chengyue’s words, Yang Chao’s face darkened. With a cold voice, he said, “Then let’s see if my thoughts are unnecessary or not.”</p> <p>While speaking, he swung his arm again and brought a series of tornadoes into the hall through the windows. The window frames were immediately rolled away, and even the walls were broken. Soon, the windows were all crushed by the spinning winds, creating large holes on the walls.</p> <p>At that point, Tang He quickly and sneakily controlled all the metal objects which were flying in the air. He melted those metal objects and turned them into a great number of sharp metal pieces, sending them flying toward Zou Shihui fleetingly.</p> <p>Seeing those sharp metal pieces flying at them, Zou Shihui’s people all remained standing still with composure. The cement wall quickly moved to before them and shielded them from those falling metal pieces.</p> <p>At that time, the people around the building had all stopped walking with astonishment, then raised their heads to look at the lightning bolts and hear that roaring wind on top of the administration building.</p> <p>“Eh? It’s the conference hall up there, right? What’s going on? Wind and lightning? Are Chief Wu and Chief Yang fighting?” The people who didn’t know what was happening pointed at the top floor and asked each other with confusion and curiosity.</p> <p>“This morning, many senior base administrators were summoned for a meeting. What’s happening now?”</p> <p>“Last night, they searched through the entire base. What now?”</p> <p>The people around the building began talking, and the ones from further places started gathering toward this area.</p> <p>“Look at the wind and lightning bolts. It must be our two Chiefs fighting up there.”</p> <p>“It has finally started. They’ve put up with each other for long.”</p> <p>“This morning, I felt that something huge was going to happen. It turns out that our Chiefs are starting a war!”</p> <p>Some people who had heard a little about it earlier whispered to each other.</p> <p>After initiating the trouble, Lin Qiao took advantage of the chaos and left this administration building. Now, she was watching the battle from the top of a smaller building which was in front of that administration building, with her arms crossed before her chest.</p> <p>Only after hearing what Wu Chengyue said did she figure out why she had been sensing a strange vibe from some of those people behind Yang Chao. Also, the scents of those people didn’t seem to be right.</p> <p>It turned out that those people were injected with the diluted zombie virus, and had been infected. That kind of infections was minor, a little similar to mutation. It was different from the infection which would happen after a healthy human being was bitten by a zombie, and those people were no longer the same as healthy human beings.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt strange and curious just now, and now she understood why. Those people’s twisted faces did look a little like those zombies out there.</p> <p>After spending a moment sensing the intense fight which was happening in the building, Lin Qiao turned and sneakily headed toward Lin Wenwen’s place.</p> <p><em>‘Hah, running after stirring up a trouble… That felt nice!’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 360: Protect Yourself": "<p>In fact, the reason why Lin Qiao went to the administration building so early in the morning to start a trouble was that Tang He, who stayed around Lin Wenwen’s place for a whole night, had left in the morning.</p> <p>Not long after Lin Qiao killed Yang Yan and returned to that residential area last night, she felt that Tang He had returned. She kept an eye on him for the entire night, but he made no move at all. So, in the morning, Lin Qiao followed him to the conference hall to watch the show.</p> <p>In a couple of minutes, Lin Qiao returned to the residential area in Region D and walked to Lin Wenwen’s door, then showed her face.</p> <p>Wei Jingchen and the other guard said no words when they saw her, but turned and politely opened the door for her.</p> <p>Before the door was opened, Lin Qiao sniffed at the air and said, “Eh? When did the little one come?”</p> <p>“Do you mean Ling Ling? She just arrived,” Wei Jingchen answered the question while opening the door.</p> <p>Once Lin Qiao walked in, a tiny person who was carrying a fluffy gray ball of fur rushed at her.</p> <p>The people who gathered before the window turned to her. Seeing Lin Qiao, one of them asked, “Eh? You’re back so soon. Didn’t they start a fight over there just now?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao rubbed the little one’s head while walking toward a couch and saying, “Yeah, they did. I’m worrying that some people might take advantage of the chaos to come here and mess with you, so I came back. As for the situation over there, I think Yang Chao will lose. He can’t defeat Wu Chengyue. After all, Wu Chengyue has already set a trap. Now, he’s just waiting for Yang Chao to jump in.”</p> <p>She paused for a moment, then looked around and pointed at the little one who had followed her to the couch, “Who brought this kid here?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen walked over, looked at her and said, “Ah, Captain Huang Ming and his people escorted her here, then left.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the little girl with confusion while murmuring to herself, “Why did he send this child here? Is nowhere safe but here?”</p> <p>At that moment, a few explosive sounds were heard from where Yuan Tianxing and the others were looking at, then that area became quite noisy.</p> <p>“It seems that they’re fighting seriously. It’s quite intense!” Yuan Tianxing said while looking at that area. After that, he turned back to Lin Qiao and said to her, “What happened when you were there?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the little one and answered his question without raising her head, “Ah, they were arguing. I was getting impatient, so I added a few more sparks to the fight. Otherwise, they might have kept wrangling forever before starting the war.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at her, feeling a little speechless. “You weren’t there to watch the show. You were there to cause trouble, right?”</p> <p>“Of course!” said Lin Qiao blandly, “If I’m able to defeat Yang Chao now, I will not need to wait for Wu Chengyue to do it.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen stepped back to the window side and looked outside. A short while later, she glanced back at Lin Qiao. There was a strange glow in her eyes, and the smile on her face grew much bigger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao seemed to have sensed something. She turned to glance at Lin Wenwen and say to her, “Does their war make you happy? You look very happy.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen suddenly had an idea. “How do you know that I’m happy?” She asked a question while knowing the answer.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned around, then took out her clipboard and handed it to Wu Yueling along with a pen. Then, while teaching the little one to draw, she answered Lin Wenwen’s question, “Your expression sold you out.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen laughed, “Alright, I didn’t think that you know me so well.</p> <p>Long Qingying, who stood aside, glanced at Lin Wenwen confusedly. However, her attention was soon attracted by the noises caused by the fight in the distance.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing excitedly gazed at that area and said, “I heard that another Chief in this base, whose last name is Zou, is actually on Wu Chengyue’s side. So, Yang Chao is fighting both of them now. What secret weapon does he have? He must have one, or he wouldn’t be stupid enough to challenge two same-level powerful beings at one time, right?”</p> <p>“His secret weapon is a level-seven partner of his,” said Lin Qiao, “Now, it’s two-vs-two.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing turned around to look at her and asked with confusion, “Eh? Where is that one from?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao said, “He made his way in long ago. Also, that level-seven man has been watching you all the time these couple of days. You just didn’t know.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Yuan Tianxing, Lin Wenwen and the others were all shocked, quickly making eye contact with each other.</p> <p>A level-seven powerful man had actually been watching them. It seemed that Lu Tianyi and Yan Fangyu weren’t exaggerating at all.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing asked with surprise, “Why was he watching us? Was he trying to find an opportunity to kidnap Wenwen? He could have directly taken action, because we wouldn’t have been able to resist at all.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen glanced at Lin Wenwen, then said, “His target is Lin Wenwen indeed. But, I guess he still has other thoughts, which is why he didn’t take action.”</p> <p>She felt that robber didn’t completely believe Yang Chao’s words, and suspected that he was probably using the latter. She wondered if that crazy Yang Chao knew about that.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and the others looked at Lin Wenwen silently.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen’s smile didn’t fade as she responded, “It seems that I’m really attractive. Is there a way to change that?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave her a glance, then said without thinking, “Yeah. Cut your hair, the shorter the better. If you change your appearance, you’ll be able to reduce the probability of many crimes.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen’s expression froze for a moment. After that, she frowned slightly and stayed silent for a few seconds. Then, she said something that surprised the others, “If that’s true, I’ll do it. What do you think?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to look at her in shock, saying, “Are you willing to do that?”</p> <p>She clearly remembered how much Lin Wenwen loved her long and straight hair. Before, Lin Qiao always felt that Lin Wenwen’s long hair could cause many inconveniences, so she had suggested her to cut her hair many times. However, Lin Wenwen never accepted her suggestion, even losing her temper because of that.</p> <p>Now, Lin Wenwen actually said something like that. <em>‘She isn’t really going to cut her hair because what I said, is she?’ </em>thought Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Long Qingying walked over and said to Lin Wenwen, “In fact, whether you cut your hair isn’t enough. You should learn to protect yourself. Before, you were under Chief’s protection, but now, you need to protect yourself.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen turned to Lin Qiao with a complicated look in her eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t look at her, but at the little one. “Qingying is right,” she said. “After learning how to protect yourself, you need to learn how to protect the others, your family, friends. Don’t you feel that you’ve been protected by your family and friends the whole time? Have you ever thought that if they suddenly lost the abilities to protect you one day, who would you depend on?”</p> <p>She remembered these words. She had said them to Lin Wenwen before. However, Lin Wenwen refused to listen to her back then. She liked to rely on others; she even needed company every time she went out. In fact, she never went out alone.</p> <p>At that time, Lin Qiao believed that she was capable enough to protect her family and friends, so she let Lin Wenwen do whatever she wanted. However, the apocalypse suddenly happened, and the world became chaotic and despairing. Only the people who managed to adapt to the new world, who had powers, could survive till last.</p> <p>The post-apocalyptic world was truly dangerous for the people who weren’t able to protect themselves.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen stood by the window side, staring at Lin Qiao without saying anything. In a couple of seconds, she suddenly turned and walked into the bedroom, then closed the door.</p>",
  "Chapter 361: That’s All You Can Do": "<p>The people who were left outside glanced at each other. Lin Qiao raised her head confusedly, then looked at the others and said, “Eh, did I say something wrong?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and sighed, “No, you’re right. I guess she just can’t accept what you said at the moment. After all, she was like a princess back in the Hades Base. Now, she needs to learn to grow up.”</p> <p>Long Qingying expressionlessly crossed her arms and said, “She has to. Chief’s protection is gone, so she really needs to learn to protect herself.”</p> <p>In the bedroom, Lin Wenwen was leaning against the door and listening to their conversation. She gently took her hands away from the door, then walked to the dressing table and sat down.</p> <p>She spent a while staring at the long-haired girl in the mirror, then lowered her head to glance at the shiny black hair before her chest. She picked up that hair with both hands and stroked them for a few seconds, then took a deep breath. After that, she abruptly took out a pair of scissors from the drawer, then picked up a lock of hair and started cutting it from near her ear.</p> <p>In the living room, Lin Qiao wasn’t interested in the fighting sounds from the outside. Instead, she was teaching the little one to draw with great interest. Uproars could be heard from around this residential area, as people were all curious about what was happening in the base center, and what caused those loud sounds.</p> <p>At that moment, the upper floors of that the administration building in the base center had already been severely damaged.</p> <p>Yang Chao was floating in the air, stepping on a tornado, while Wu Chengyue was standing on the roof with his hands behind his back. He was tall and slim, wearing an over-knee dust coat, looking serious and handsome. The lower hem of his coat fluttered in the wind, exposing his long and straight legs.</p> <p>He slightly raised her chin. His handsome face was wearing a faint smile while he coldly looked at Yang Chao, who was in the midair.</p> <p>The people around the building had all been confusedly watching the scene on the roof, and the people who were in the building had all been evacuated.</p> <p>Above Wu Chengyue’s head was a massive, dense dark cloud, which even darkened the entire area. Rumbling thunders could be heard from the dark cloud from time to time, with bolts of lightning flashing across.</p> <p>Zou Shihui was standing before a French window of a room on a middle floor of the building. The window glass before him was shattered entirely by the attacks which were launched by the other two base leaders and himself just now.</p> <p>“Yang Chao has been secretly running a dangerous virus experiment on some people from this base. For that reason, the people who went missing within the past few months have all died. The number of victims has gone beyond five-hundred. Chief Wu, I, and the other administrators have come to an agreement that Yang Chao and the people who have taken parts in the experiment under his order will be expelled from the base. The name list will be released very soon. For the peace of the base, we will punish them together,” Zou Shihui’s resonant voice was heard from the tall building.</p> <p>“What? It was he who kidnapped those people! Virus experiment? What virus experiment?”</p> <p>“Have they all died?”</p> <p>The crowd which gathered around the building was immediately stirred up. Those people could scarcely believe what they had heard, and also didn’t agree with the order of expulsion.</p> <p>“Why are we letting them go? They have killed so many people! We can’t let them go! They have to pay for what they’ve done with their lives!”</p> <p>“That’s right, Chief Zou, we can’t let them go! We should kill Yang Chao, that lunatic! How dare he run an experiment with living human beings! This is unforgivable!”</p> <p>At that moment, Zou Shihui responded, “Don’t worry! Yang Chao is the chief culprit. We don’t place to let him go. Just watch what Chief Wu can do.”</p> <p>Yang Chao floated in the midair and sneered, “Wanna catch me? Are you able to do that?”</p> <p>While speaking, he suddenly waved a hand toward the crowd on the ground. A roaring gust of wind was immediately sent toward those people.</p> <p>“Ah!”</p> <p>“Hold something!”</p> <p>“Hide! Hide!”</p> <p>The people on the ground instantly forgot about the show that they had been watching. Under the threat of the wind, they hurriedly looked for shelter. Some of them who reacted slowly were brought into the air, flipping in the air and then thudding against the ground. Some others were directly blown to the ground, rolling.</p> <p>Following a series of thunder, a few purple lightning bolts descended from the sky, striking at Yang Chao.</p> <p>Yang Chao quickly moved to another spot to dodge. However, before he stopped moving, the lightning almost landed on his head.</p> <p>On the roof of the administration building, Wu Chengyue reached out his hand and drew a line toward Yang Chao. Following his movement, arm-thick lightning bolts fell toward Yang Chao’s head wave after wave.</p> <p>As a possessor of wind power, Yang Chao was weaker at attacking than Wu Chengyue was, but was the best at dodging. He moved fleetingly and didn’t let Wu Chengyue’s lightning touch his body.</p> <p>“Hehe, is that all that a lightning-powered man can do?” While dodging, Yang Chao still had the mood to mock Wu Chengyue. His voice was spread to a long distance away by the energy inside him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue pointed his long and lean fingers at Yang Chao. Wherever he pointed at, lightning bolts would fall into that area.</p> <p>After hearing what Yang Chao said, he gave a faint smile and responded, “Would you like to know what lightning power can do? I’ll fulfill your wish.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, he suddenly spread his fingers, then clenched both fists and swung his arms downward. In the next moment, the sky above Yang Chao’s head was darkened, as dark clouds suddenly pressed down on his head. Waves of lightning bolts descended together, falling toward Yang Chao like a rain.</p> <p>By the time Yang Chao raised his head to find out what was happening, it was already too late. The lightning rain didn’t affect a huge area, but had the coverage of about twenty-meters squared, and was falling extremely fast. No matter how fast he could run, he wouldn’t be able to dodge this.</p> <p>“Ah…” Yang Chao tried his best to wrap himself up with the wind and move toward the outside as quickly as possible. But to his surprise, the horrible lightning rain actually moved with him.</p> <p>Soon, he was covered in lightning bolts and struck onto the ground.</p> <p>Seeing that Yang Chao had no chance of winning, Tang He abruptly turned and prepared to leave.</p> <p>“Freeze! Wanna run?” Zou Shihui had been keeping an eye on Tang He the whole time. As the latter started drawing back, he immediately chased.</p> <p>Yang Chao fell on the ground, but wasn’t harmed severely because he was protected by a gust of wind. Upon landing on the ground, he happened to see that Tang He was trying to leave.</p> <p>“What kind of a helper did you find? He decided the run once the situation turned bad for him. Smart!” Wu Chengyue leaped off the building and stood on a utility pole near Yang Chao as he smiled faintly.</p>",
  "Chapter 362: Yang Chao’s Transformation": "<p>Yang Chao started to feel bad upon seeing Tang He run. So, after hearing what Wu Chengyue said, his face darkened immediately. However, he had no spare attention for Tang He at the moment, because a huge bolt of lightning fell from the sky, striking at him.</p> <p>That lightning bolt was as thick as a pillar. It went straight to Yang Chao’s head as if it were conscious.</p> <p>Yang Chao’s heart missed a beat. He felt a coldness from his spine, and a sense of crisis rose spontaneously in his heart.</p> <p>He hurriedly tried to dodge. However, when he moved, the lightning bolt moved along with him. It turned in the air and again fell toward him.</p> <p>That bolt of lightning was falling faster than the ones before by many times over. Within a blink, it caught up with Yang Chao and landed thunderously on his back.</p> <p>“Ah!” Thud!</p> <p>Yang Chao howled out loud as he was thrown to the ground by the explosion of the lightning bolts. This time, his body suffered a horrible lightning power, even though his wind power had taken a great amount of it for him.</p> <p>“Ou-ch…” He rolled on the ground, then tremblingly struggled up from the ground. His black coat was ragged in the explosion, and his face had turned black.</p> <p>That was the difference between his power and Wu Chengyue’s. They were at the same level, but the destructive capabilities of lightning power and wind power weren’t at the same grade.</p> <p>Right after he got up, he raised his head to see another giant bolt of lightning coming at his face.</p> <p>Boom! This time, he didn’t even manage to react before the lightning landed on him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s lightning erased a big half of his energy, and the rest began surging disorderedly in his body.</p> <p>“Your life, and the lives of your subordinates. aren’t enough to pay back the people who have died because of your experiments.” Wu Chengyue’s cold voice was heard. He rarely talked so coldly. Normally, he would wear a faint smile, and his voice would be gentle and warm.</p> <p>But today, although he was still wearing that smile, the look in his eyes was icy cold.</p> <p>“Hehe… Haha… Hahaha… Do you wanna kill me? Do you think that’ll be so easy?” Yang Chao staggeringly got up from the ground, looking like a human-shaped piece of charcoal. Meanwhile, he burst into laughter, his face twisting.</p> <p>He widely opened his mouth and bared his teeth while his mouth began cracking weirdly. Soon, his bones started to make a series of creaking noises, and his body began changing shape.</p> <p>“Roar!” Streams of saliva flowed out of his widened mouth from between his teeth.</p> <p>“Let me show you the results of my experiment! Hahaha…” When he was roaring at Wu Chengyue, his eyes were still clear, but carrying a crazy look.</p> <p>Looking at Yang Chao who had already become half-human, half-monster, Wu Chengyue couldn’t help but cover his eyes and say, “Ugh… You have become so ugly. I honestly don’t want to fight you anymore! I can’t even bear looking at you!”</p> <p>After saying that, he suddenly pointed at Yang Chao and swung his arm down to summon another bolt of lightning.</p> <p>Boom! The lightning bolt fell from the sky. However, as it was about to strike on Yang Chao, he flashed aside and dodged it, then leaped onto the building nearby, quickly climbing up like a spider.</p> <p>Bang! Another purple lightning bolt fell toward Yang Chao who was climbing on the building.</p> <p>The people who were trying to find shelter around the building all looked at Yang Chao with confusion after watching him become a monster.</p> <p>“He… He… Why did he suddenly become like this?”</p> <p>“What kind of monster is this?”</p> <p>At the moment, Yang Chao was crawling on all fours; his spine had turned huge and bulging, which made his entire upper body hunch. His arms grew even thicker than his thighs, fingers turned into crooked claws, and legs were bent weirdly.</p> <p>He crawled quickly on the building, and soon leaped onto another wall.</p> <p>“He’s running! Aren’t you gonna do something?” Xiao Yunlong stood behind Wu Chengyue and asked him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue waved a hand and brought a few lightning bolts down from the sky, sending them to Yang Chao who was on another wall of the building. However, the latter nimbly dodged them all.</p> <p>“You see, he’s better at dodging now. And I guess, he might also be immune to energy attacks now,” Wu Chengyue stared at Yang Chao and said.</p> <p>All of a sudden, he flashed onto the other side of the building and disappeared. Wu Chengyue hurriedly leaped onto the roof of the administration building, then darted at Yang Chao’s building.</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue left swiftly, Xiao Yunlong followed behind him with curiosity.</p> <p>Normally, level-seven superpowered people weren’t able to float in the air. The wind-powered ones were special, as their winds could support their bodies and allow them to float and fly.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue jumped onto the roof of another building and launched a few lightning bolts in a row to attack Yang Chao, who was constantly dodging. However, as he just said, his attack failed to deliver any effect.</p> <p>After suffering the lightning attack, Yang Chao was still crawling all over the wall as if nothing had happened.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong caught up with Wu Chengyue. Seeing this situation, he said with surprise, “Eh, your attack really seems to be ineffective on him.”</p> <p>Then, he swung a hand toward Yang Chao. Following his movement, large amounts of metal objects turned into sharp metal pieces and surrounded Yang Chao, then flew at him.</p> <p>“Roar!” Yang Chao dodge in a flurry. But still, some sharp metal pieces pierced into his body and made him howl in pain, also causing him to pause for a few seconds and slow down.</p> <p>“I guess only physical attacks can hurt him now,” Xiao Yunlong put down his hands and said.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded and didn’t say anything as he kept chasing after Yang Chao.</p> <p>Yang Chao had no desire to continue fighting at the moment. Instead, he was running toward the outside as quickly as possible.</p> <p>On the other side, Lin Qiao, who had been playing with the little one, paused briefly, as if she had sensed something. Afterward, she confusedly glanced at the people who were still gathering around the window and gazing at the base center.</p> <p>But soon, she carelessly turned back around and glanced at the bedroom which Lin Wenwen had gone in earlier.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then said, “Qingying, can you go to the bedroom and check on Wenwen? Maybe my words were too harsh for her?”</p> <p>Long Qingying silently looked at her for a few seconds, then responded, “She didn’t go to… cut her hair, did she?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked back at Long Qingying uncertainly, saying, “That’s impossible! She treasures her hair so much. How can she possibly be willing to cut it?”</p> <p>Long Qingying slightly lowered head and thought for a short while, then said, “I don’t think so. You’re right, but I think she’s been a little weird these days.” While speaking, she raised her head to look at the others, and those people all nodded to agree with her.</p> <p>“I’ll go check on her then,” she said and turned and walked toward the bedroom.</p>",
  "Chapter 363: I’m Not Wearing Glasses": "<p>Lin Qiao turned to Yuan Tianxing and asked, “She said that Wenwen has been weird these days. What happened?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head confusedly to let Lin Qiao know that he didn’t know what Lin Wenwen was thinking. He always felt that girls’ thoughts were the hardest to understand, because they changed all the time. How could he know what Wenwen had been thinking…?</p> <p>Du Yuanxing, who stood beside Yuan Tianxing, showed a strange look in his eyes. He hurriedly turned to the window, as he felt that he shouldn’t tell the Lin Qiao that Wenwen had asked him about her, in case the zombie sister might misunderstand something and cause some awful results.</p> <p>Long Qingying knocked on the door, then pushed it open and walked in.</p> <p>She then walked into the bedroom and saw Lin Wenwen sitting before the dresser table, cutting her hair. At that point, half of Lin Wenwen’s beautiful black hair had been cut off by herself.</p> <p>Long Qingying widened her eyes as she couldn’t believe what she had seen. “You… really cut your hair? What were you thinking?” she said.</p> <p>She didn’t think that Lin Wenwen would really listen to Lin Qiao’s words.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen turned around, then sighed and said, “I don’t want to bring troubles to you guys, so I’m going to change myself as much as I can. Qingying, come over to help me. I can’t cut the hair at the back well.”</p> <p>Long Qingying was still staring at Lin Wenwen with disbelief when she walked to her, filled with both surprise and confusion.</p> <p>“Why’re you looking at me like that? You said that I don’t know how to protect myself. You also said that wearing dresses might make some people want to commit a crime, so I stopped wearing them, didn’t I? Long hair causes inconveniences, so I’m cutting it, alright? I also want to learn how to fight from you. You have to teach me,” Lin Wenwen rolled her eyes toward Long Qingying while handing her the scissors.</p> <p>Long Qingying took over the scissors and disagreed her with confusion, “What? Why do I have to teach you? Can’t you find other teachers?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen raised her head to look at Long Qingying and asked, “Who do you think it should be?”</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at her and said, “You can ask Wangxue to teach you. She’s good at fighting, and she has super strength.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen rolled her eyes again and said, “As you said, my sister-in-law has super strength. She can destroy a wall with one kick, alright? Do you want her to disable me? Can’t I learn some basic stuff from you first, and then go ask her to teach me?”</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at her without knowing what to say, because she found Lin Wenwen’s words making sense.</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue had super strength. Her strength was greater than that of a normal human being by at least five times. Besides, she was at level-five now, and was able to easily defeat ten healthy men at one time, not to mention Lin Wenwen, who was just like a princess.</p> <p>There was no better way of learning how to fight than suffering beating. That was the best way to stimulate the ability of human bodies.</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at Lin Wenwen’s face and raised her eyebrows as she said with doubt, “Exercise first. You need to improve your physical fitness before starting to practice fighting. Are you really gonna do that? You’re not just joking, are you? Or, will you give up really quickly? I don’t have the time to play that kind of game with you.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen gave a chuckle and said, “Keep underestimating me. I’ll make you so surprised that your glasses will even fall off.”</p> <p>Long Qingying said expressionlessly while cutting the air with the scissors, “Sorry, I’m not wearing glasses.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen shrugged, then turned around with her back to Long Qingying while saying, “Don’t let your jaw drop then.”</p> <p>In the living room, Lin Qiao showed a strange expression as she had faintly heard the conversation between Lin Wenwen and Long Qingying. She glanced at the others and thought for a moment, but decided not to say it out loud. However, she did feel that Long Qingying was right about Lin Wenwen being a little weird.</p> <p>She cut her hair… She was actually willing to cut her hair! She hadn’t cut her hair in over ten years. Lin Qiao had suggested her to cut those hair countless times before, but she refused. However, she had now thought it through and cut the hair herself.</p> <p>And why on earth did she want to learn how to fight? She was a weak little girl who couldn’t even walk five steps with a bucket of water. But now, she actually wanted to learn how to fight! Wouldn’t she be crying so loud after taking a few hits?</p> <p>Lin Qiao now wondered if her sister’s body was occupied by some other soul.</p> <p>After all, she had occupied someone else’s body!</p> <p>Hearing the continuous thunders from the base center growing louder and louder, Yuan Tianxing said, “Chief Wu’s is really powerful. He has been launching such destructive attacks, but why hasn’t he killed Yang Chao yet? Isn’t Yang Chao a possessor of wind power? He’s not good in attacking or defending, and can only dodge quickly, isn’t that right?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing nodded and agreed with him, “Yeah, the fight has lasted for over half an hour, and they seem to have been moving. I think Yang Chao is trying to run.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing crossed his arms before his chest and said, “I don’t Chief Wu will let him run.”</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao joined the conversation, “I doubt that. Right now, Yang Chao’s vibe has somehow changed entirely. If Wu Chengyue gets overconfident, he might regret it. However, he has prepared for long, so I think he won’t be careless and let Yang Chao run. If he did, that would be embarrassing.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing turned back as he glanced at her and said, “What have you sensed?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “Just some unclear changes in his vibe.”</p> <p>After saying that, she stood up and walked to the window, then closed her eyes and sniffed toward the outside.</p> <p>Then, she opened her eyes and said, “He was infected by the virus. The virus inside him should have been suppressed by his power, but he seems to have released it all now and become a half-human, half-zombie creature. If I have guessed right, even his appearance might have changed.”</p> <p>That was only her guess. She wasn’t sure if it was real or not.</p> <p>Soon, Lin Wenwen’s door was opened. Lin Qiao and the others immediately turned in that direction and saw a young short-haired woman walking out.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen walked out with the roughly cut bob hair, looking completely different. She used to look gentle and quiet, but now, she suddenly became neat and dashing. Her pretty baby face was wearing a faint smile, and was added with a different type of cuteness. Apart from that, a glow of determination had appeared in her eyes.</p> <p>Behind her, Long Qingying was observing the reactions of Yuan Tianxing and the others with interests.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had foreseen this as she had overheard the conversation which happened in the bedroom earlier. So, upon seeing her little sister with the new look, she only felt novel about it.</p> <p>Besides, her sister didn’t look bad with short hair because of her baby face. However, that roughly styled hair did make her less pretty.</p> <p>Unlike Lin Qiao, Yuan Tianxing and Du Yuanxing were both stunned. They gazed at Lin Qiao with complicated expressions which contained surprise, confusion, and many other feelings.</p> <p>“You, you… What stimulated you?” Du Yuanxing couldn’t help but start talking.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen hadn’t yet adapted to her new look. So after hearing Du Yuanxing’s words, she angrily glanced at him.</p> <p>“You’re stimulated! Didn’t you tell me to cut my hair?”</p>",
  "Chapter 364: Viney Wakes Up": "<p>Yuan Tianxing and Du Yuanxing instantly turned to Lin Qiao to try and tell Lin Wenwen that it was Lin Qiao who gave that suggestion, and not them. Meanwhile, Lin Qiao glanced at Lin Wenwen and said, “You cut your hair because I told you so? Why are you so obedient to me? Haven’t you ever thought about cutting your hair before? Someone used to give you the same suggestion, right?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen touched the short hair near her tear awkwardly while saying, “It’s because the circumstances before weren’t as bad as now. Besides, if I refused to cut my hair, you guys might complain.”</p> <p><em>‘We’ll still complain about you even though you have cut your hair!’ </em>The others said in their heads.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen seemed to have sensed their gazes. “Judging by the way you’re looking at me now, you’ll think that I’m not strong enough even though I’ve already cut my hair, don’t you? That’s reasonable though. I cut my hair, but nothing else changed.”</p> <p>“In fact, even if you want to change, you didn’t need to cut your hair,” said Long Qingying expressionlessly.</p> <p>“I cut my hair because short hair is convenient to take care of, and easy to wash,” said Lin Wenwen, “I can save some water this way. Isn’t it better?”</p> <p>Long Qingying looked at her, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>“Whatever you like,” said Lin Qiao, “However, you’ve cut your hair, and it means something in your heart has changed. Do what you think you should be doing.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen looked at her and nodded, then walked to the window as she looked at the dark cloud which rumbled from time to time, “When will the fight stop? Won’t they cause great damages by fighting like that in the base?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing answered her question, “There will certainly be damages. As for whether the damages will be great or not, I think no.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao prepared to stand up and walk to the window to look outside as well. But suddenly, she sensed something from her space. After pausing for a second, she disappeared on the couch.</p> <p>After spending an afternoon and a night to absorb the energy, Viney finally made a move.</p> <p>Lin Qiao showed up by the lakeside, watching the roaring waves in the lake.This time, the water level didn’t rise, but the energy contained in the water had grown denser.</p> <p>She glanced back and found that Shen Yujen has already hidden in a small space, maybe because of the noise from the water.</p> <p>In the woods, the zombie dog was quietly and motionlessly lying on the ground.</p> <p>The water surface calmed down gradually. Lin Qiao thought that Viney would reach out countless vines; but even after waiting for a while, she didn’t see any familiar vine coming out of the water.</p> <p>Right at that moment, she saw something in the water moving toward her.</p> <p>The dim figure in the water was… <em>‘Eh, why does it look like an octopus? </em>‘ Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>She widened her eyes to stare at the mysterious figure which was moving its short tentacles to swim toward Lin Qiao. As it got closer and closer, Lin Qiao started to show a strange expression. The look on her face contained shock, delight, confusion, strong curiosity, and anticipation.</p> <p>That creature which was swimming toward her was Viney indeed.</p> <p>Judging by her current look, Viney had freed herself from the bottom of the lake already. Was she able to move freely now? Was she able to come ashore? Why did she become smaller than before? It had turned larger after every upgrade previously.</p> <p>As the white creature got closer and closer to Lin Qiao and bobbed up from the water, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but give a grin.</p> <p>That jade-white color was Viney’s color, but the shape…</p> <p>A cluster of vines about one-meter long softly hung behind her white and chubby body.</p> <p>Viney’s body looked like a ball, so Lin Qiao couldn’t tell which part was her stomach and which part was her neck or head. She did find her face though, as Viney had a pair of large green eyes, a tiny nose, and no mouth!</p> <p>In fact, Viney’s body was shaped like a giant radish, with relatively smaller head and tail, and a large and round belly. A few strong roots were seen on her tail.</p> <p>Viney blinked her watery, large green eyes as she supported her body with those strong roots, then happily rushed toward Lin Qiao. However, after making merely two steps, her roots entangled together and then she fell to the ground, rolling back into the water.</p> <p>“Hah! Viney? Is it you?” Lin Qiao knew that it was Viney, but still, she couldn’t help but call her name with laughter.</p> <p>Viney sat up from the water after making a few rolls toward the lake center, then raised her root legs and continued running toward Lin Qiao. But as a result, she fell again.</p> <p>Looking at Viney’s pitiful large eyes, Lin Qiao walked into the lake with a grin, then bent over to scoop up the big-bellied Viney. At that moment, she found that Viney was quite heavy.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, Mama! Viney can come up and play! Hahahaha…’</em></p> <p>Once she held her up, Lin Qiao heard Viney’s voice and her familiar tone of talking.</p> <p>Carrying Viney, Lin Qiao found that her body wasn’t hard, but was as soft and elastic as a sponge, and was very heavy!</p> <p>“Viney, why are you so heavy?” Lin Qiao couldn’t help but ask. If she weren’t a zombie with great strength, she wouldn’t be able to scoop Viney up, as the latter weighed at least fifty kilograms now.</p> <p>Viney didn’t have hands. However, she happily swung her baby-finger-thick, hair-like vines and her toe-thick roots to deliver a message to Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, Mama, this isn’t Viney’s original shape! Viney can become bigger! Mama, can you bring the little one in here to play with me now? I sensed her vibe. She’s outside!’</em></p> <p>“Why do you need her to come in?” Lin Qiao asked, “Can’t you go out with me now?”</p> <p>Viney tried to shake her head, but in the end, her entire body began shaking, and she almost fell from Lin Qiao’s arms. So, she stopped shaking, but swayed her hair and began talking.</p> <p><em>‘No. I can’t touch the air outside now. The air outside will kill me.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was shocked by the answer. Just now, she almost brought Viney straight out, as she didn’t think that there’d be an air problem.</p> <p>“Eh? Why?” she asked confusedly.</p> <p>Viney answered her question, <em>‘I can only stay in here to absorb the lake water and the clean air in this place to survive. And, Mama, I haven’t finished my evolution yet. I’ll soon enter the second phase, but I have to do it together with Mama.”</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Clean air? Are you saying that the air outside isn’t clean?”</p> <p>Viney twisted her hair-like vines and responded, ‘Yes, the air outside will corrode my white body. I can’t get out.’</p> <p>“How can you get out then?” Lin Qiao asked, “Do you have to reach level-five to be able to go out? Haven’t you entered level-four yet?”</p> <p>Viney responded with, <em>‘Not yet! Mama, just go and bring the little one in! Viney wants to play with her! And Mama, bring someone you like in here. It has to be a man, hurry up!’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 365: A Bad Feeling": "<p>Lin Qiao lowered her head and looked at Viney as she asked with confusion, “What man? Why do I need to find a man? Tell me why first.”</p> <p>Viney responded with, <em>‘Em, em, just a man you like, eh… He’ll also be helping Viney with the upgrade. Mama has to do it with a person of the opposite gender… Or mama, you can also find someone you don’t like… That’ll also work…’</em></p> <p>For some reason, Lin Qiao got a bad feeling from Viney’s words.</p> <p>“Are you saying that this time, I need to find a man and get into the lake together with him?”</p> <p><em>‘Yes, yes!’ </em>Viney responded.</p> <p>“Then?” Lin Qiao asked further.</p> <p><em>‘Then? What then?’ </em>Viney didn’t understand.</p> <p>“After two of us get into the lake, how will we help you with the upgrade?” Lin Qiao said.</p> <p><em>‘That I don’t know for sure… I’ll know what to do by then…’ </em>Viney didn’t give her a specific answer.</p> <p>It was really strange for Lin Qiao. Why did she need to find a man and bring him into the space? Would she and that man be going down into the water and then facing each other naked?</p> <p><em>‘Ugh, this is really not good. What is Viney planning to do?’ </em>she wondered.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, Viney wants to see the little one! Please bring her in to play with me…’</em></p> <p>Viney really wanted Lin Qiao to bring Wu Yueling into the space to play at the moment, and didn’t seem to care about other things. Lin Qiao looked at the weird-looking Viney and said, “You’ve become like this. Will you scare the little one?”</p> <p>Viney swayed the vines on her head and responded, “No, no, I told her last time that I’ll transform…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Viney speechlessly. She didn’t know that Viney had told Wu Yueling about that the last time.</p> <p>“Alright, wait here then,” Lin Qiao carried Viney to a small space and put her on a couch, then prepared to go out to bring Wu Yueling in. Before exiting the space, she abruptly paused, then said, “Eh, are you cold? Do you need to cover yourself with a cloth?”</p> <p>Viney sat on the couch, swinging her vines and roots while answering the question, “I’m not cold.”</p> <p>“Alright then, wait here.” After that, Lin Qiao stood up and turned to exit the space.</p> <p>As she came out of her space, the others all turned toward her. Then, those people saw that she carried Wu Yueling and the gray rabbit which was in the little girl’s arms, and disappeared again.</p> <p>“What happened to her?” asked Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and said, “How am I supposed to know?”</p> <p>“Eh, she brought the little princess into her space,” said Du Yuanxing, “What should we do if Chief Wu come here later to pick up the little girl?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing glanced at him and laughed, “What do you want to do? Just tell him that his daughter was brought into Miss. Lu’s space.”</p> <p>“Alright,” said Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>Long Qingying also gave him a glance, then said, “Why are you over thinking? Miss. Lu won’t hurt the little princess. What are you worrying about?” She wondered why didn’t she find that Du Yuanxing was a little silly sometimes. He was pretty normal to her when they carried the last mission together.</p> <p>Lin Qiao brought Wu Yueling into her space, put her on the couch, then pointed at Viney and asked her, “Do you still know her?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling was used to being taken in and out of Lin Qiao’s space. After being brought in, she naturally turned to the lakeside; but after hearing Lin Qiao’s question, she turned around to look at Viney who was staring at her with a pair of large, sparkling eyes.</p> <p>Seeing Viney, her eyes glowed immediately. Then, she hurriedly slid off the couch and walked toward it.</p> <p>Viney sat still, swaying her root legs. As Wu Yueling got close enough, she put her vines on the little one’s hands. Then, the two little things looked at each other smilingly.</p> <p>Wu Yueling rarely had expressions on her face. But now, Lin Qiao found that the look on her face had been making quite some changes, like that of normal people. It was especially so when she was by herself, or with Viney or the gray rabbit.</p> <p>With Lin Qiao, Viney or the gray rabbit, Wu Yueling always radiated happy feelings.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that Wu Yueling liked Viney a lot, because she had already noticed the smile which was shown unwittingly on the corners of the girl’s mouth. She wondered if Wu Yueling had noticed that herself.</p> <p>“Little one, when will you talk to us?” she asked.</p> <p>She felt that Wu Yueling’s autistic symptoms had already decreased a lot. However, she didn’t know if she felt that way because the kid had accepted her and Viney.</p> <p>The little one turned back to look at Lin Qiao and slightly opened her mouth. However, she didn’t utter any sound, but turned around and continued playing with Viney.</p> <p>Viney pulled her onto the couch with her vines, then made the girl sit beside her. After that, the two little things seemed to have started a discussion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat beside them and felt that they were discussing something really important.</p> <p>The gray rabbit seemed to have sensed that no one would play with it. It was quite familiar with the environment and the vibe of this place, so it quickly hopped away from the little one toward the strawberry field.</p> <p>It had been eating cabbages for days. Now, it desperately wanted some vegetables from this space, because the vegetables outside tasted awful!</p> <p>Lin Qiao had no idea that the two little things were now talking about…</p> <p>Viney, <em>‘I’m going to find Mama a man.’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling, <em>‘I’m going to find my Daddy a wife…’</em></p> <p>Viney looked at Wu Yueling with surprise and asked, <em>‘Eh? What do you think about my Mama then? Do you like her?’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling nodded and responded a little uncertainly, <em>‘Zombie sister is so nice… I like her, I like her… But I don’t know if Daddy likes her too…’</em></p> <p>Viney narrowed her watery green eyes and said, <em>‘Bring your Daddy here and let me see him… I’ll make him like my Mama, hehe…’ </em>While speaking, Viney suddenly began chuckling wickedly.</p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at her confusedly with a pair of bright black eyes, saying,<em>‘Really? How to make Daddy like Zombie Sister?’</em></p> <p>Viney told her, <em>‘You’ll be calling her Mama in the future. I have my way of doing that.’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at Viney with doubts, then slowly nodded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know that not long after she brought Wu Yueling in, she was sold to the girl by Viney. On the other side, Wu Chengyue, who had been chasing Yang Chao with Xiao Yunlong,, had no idea that he was already sold to a slightly cunning little vine plant either.</p> <p>At that time, he and Xiao Yunlong had followed Yang Chao to the outskirts of the base from the base center.</p> <p>After the transformation, Yang Chao had become really fast. Also, he only chose crowded or narrow places to go to, so Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong’s attacks were highly limited.</p> <p>“Roar… Haha… Come on, blow this entire building off if you dare… If you can’t, what can you possibly do to me?” Yang Chao crawled into a residential building while laughing at Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Soon, a series of screams from frightened people were heard from the building, and then, the screams turned into howls.</p>",
  "Chapter 366: Yang Chao Is Killed": "<p>Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong arrived at the building, both showed grim looks upon hearing the sounds from the building.</p> <p>“He has started eating people!” Wu Chengyue swiftly flashed into the building while speaking.</p> <p>He knew that the superpowered people who were infected by the virus would become monsters once their energies failed to suppress the virus. Their internal organs and digestive system would also change.</p> <p>They would lose interest in normal food, and start to have appetites toward flesh and blood of living human beings.</p> <p>When Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong rushed into the building, they saw quite some fresh blood splashed on the wall and corridor, as they had expected. They two had a very bad feeling as they followed the blood at an even quicker speed.</p> <p>At that moment, Yang Chao was holding the back of a woman’s neck in his widely cracked mouth, dragging her and quickly running on all fours.</p> <p>Along with his swift moves, the woman’s body was swinging in the air like a piece of cloth. When Yang Chao turned around corners, her body bumped against the walls from time to time. However, she could no longer utter screams in pain, because she had stopped breathing.</p> <p>Yang Chao was biting the back of her neck, and his mouth was filled with blood.</p> <p>After dragging the woman upstairs, he felt that Wu Chengyue and Xiao Yunlong wouldn’t catch up with him soon. So, he brought her to an empty area and began tearing her clothes. Soon, the woman’s clothes were all ripped off.</p> <p>He stripped the woman, then violently pinched her breasts with his distorted hands. Suddenly, he clenched his fingers and tore off the woman’s breasts. He put the pair of breasts into his mouth and began chewing loudly, the blood dying his teeth and claws red.</p> <p>He quickly chewed and swallowed the breasts, then abruptly glanced back at the stairs. After that, he quickly turned around and ran.</p> <p>But, before he made it to two meters, a wall suddenly extended out from the wall next to him and blocked his way. However, he didn’t really care about that wall. He paused briefly, then swung an arm and punched at it.</p> <p>With his current strength, he was able to create a hole on a normal wall with a punch. Nevertheless, the wall before him wasn’t just an ordinary wall, because his punch failed to even leave a crack on it.</p> <p>“How dare you eat people in the base! Yang Chao, you lunatic!” Zou Shihui’s voice was heard.</p> <p>“Roar!” Yang Chao turned to try and run on the other side, but then found that the way behind him was blocked too.</p> <p>He turned and turned, laughing with a twisted voice, “Hehehe, women’s breasts taste the best… You can all try…”</p> <p>Before he could finish talking, large amounts of steel sticks suddenly shot out of the surrounding walls straight toward him. He ran around in that narrow space like, but didn’t manage to dodge all the steel sticks and let a few finger-thick, one-meter-long sticks pierce through his body.</p> <p>“Roar!” He roared agitatedly, then stopped running and gripped a stick with both hands, trying to pull it out. Soon, the stick was pulled out along with blood.</p> <p>As he turned to reached his hands to another steel stick, another steel stick suddenly punctured his head.</p> <p>He froze, his hands on a stick which was stuck in his body. Then, he popped his eyes and slowly fell to the ground.</p> <p>The two extra walls slowly drew backward. From behind one of those walls, Wu Chengyue, Zou Shihui, and Xiao Yunlong walked toward Yang Chao who was lying on the ground with a stick stuck in its head.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong walked up to Yang Chao the first and alertly kicked his body. After confirming the latter’s death, he turned to say to the others, “He’s dead. But, he murdered a woman before death. How are we gonna deal with him now?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at Zou Shihui and said, “Zou, you go hunt down all his accomplices, and I’ll comfort the people.”</p> <p>Zou Shihui nodded. He glanced at Yang Chao and sighed in relief, then turned and left.</p> <p>“Cut off his head,” said Wu Chengyue to Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong waved a hand. Following his move, all the steel sticks gathered together and merged into one, then melted into a sphere.</p> <p>He raised one hand in the air to control the steel sphere while drawing lines toward it with the other. Along with his movements, the steel sphere was turned into a sharp blade, with a beam of light flashing across it.</p> <p>After that, Xiao Yunlong pressed both hands downward, and next, the steel blade fell on Yang Chao’s body. With a loud ‘bang’, his head was cut off, and a stream of blood gushed out of the broken neck.</p> <p>In the meanwhile, Wu Chengyue walked to the dead woman’s body and checked it, “She’s infected. We don’t know if she’ll turn into a zombie. Keep it well for now. We’ll be observing it later.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!”</p> <p>At that moment, Xiao Yunlong pointed at Yang Chao’s head and asked, “Should we take out the nucleus in it?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded and said, “Take it out. He’s a level-seven after all.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Xiao Yunlong controlled the steel blade and cut Yang Chao’s head, then picked up a steel stick to stir his brain. Soon, a nucleus fell out.</p> <p>He picked up the nucleus and wiped it on Yang Chao’s ragged coat, then stood up and turned to hand it to Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>“Keep it. You killed him, so this nucleus surely belongs to you,” Wu Chengyue didn’t take it over as he spoke while turning and leaving. “Bring the two corpses down,” he then added.</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” The soldiers around responded immediately.</p> <p>Before coming up, they knew that a victim was attacked and brought upstairs by Yang Chao, so they had prepared white cloth and a stretcher. They covered that female corpse with a white cloth, then tied it up with ropes. After that, they began carrying the two corpses downstairs.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong held the nucleus and glanced at Yang Chao’s headless body, then followed behind Wu Chengyue. While walking downstairs, Wu Chengyue assigned Xiao Yunlong with some clean-up tasks, then began comforting those panicked people who had gathered around the building.</p> <p>If Lin Qiao were staying on the outside, she would certainly be able to sense Yang Chao’s death the moment it happened. However, she was still in her space at the moment, teaching Viney how to walk.</p> <p>Yes, she was teaching Viney how to walk.</p> <p>Viney had six legs, each as thick as Lin Qiao’s thumb; they were about half a meter long, white and tender, looking rather cute.</p> <p>However, once she got on her feet, she would forget how to control her little root legs. She could smoothly control every single one of the hair-like vines on her head, but not her root legs.</p> <p>When walking, she wouldn’t even know which leg to move first. Sometimes, she would move two or three legs together in different directions, and then her legs would tangle together and become a mess.</p> <p>And then… she would fall again!</p>",
  "Chapter 367: Weird Vines": "<p>Lin Qiao and Wu Yueling quietly squatted aside, looking at Viney who was refusing to stand up.</p> <p>“Viney, why can you control your hair but not your legs?” Lin Qiao looked at her and asked with a complicated expression.</p> <p>Viney turned on the ground as she twirled the vines on her head and her little root legs to the other side, then put a vine on Lin Qiao’s hand.</p> <p><em>‘Because my legs are roots… roots… They usually only stay in the earth, and don’t move…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Wu Yueling, then turned back to Viney, “Even the little one runs quicker than you. Get up, quickly!”</p> <p>Viney made a few rolls on the ground, then supported her body with the vines on her head to stand up.</p> <p>Looking at the shambling Viney, Wu Yueling wanted to give a hand, but Lin Qiao didn’t let her</p> <p>“Don’t go. She might fall upon you. She’s heavy, so she’ll probably hurt you.”</p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at Viney with hesitation, then glanced at Lin Qiao, seeming to be struggling.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Viney stood quite steadily, but couldn’t walk.</p> <p>“Raise one leg first, then make a step. Move another leg after you have steadied yourself. Be patient, slow… The second leg… the third leg… Yes, just like this… Walk slowly…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a whole hour teaching Viney how to walk. Only after that was the latter able to walk slowly. Still, she couldn’t run; once she tried, her six legs would knit together and trip her.</p> <p>In the small space, Shen Yujen hid beside the entrance, sticking her head out and curiously watching Lin Qiao teach Viney how to walk. She wanted to come out very much, but she was quite afraid of Viney’s vibe. So, with no other choice, she kept hiding there and watching.</p> <p>She was also very curious about why Princess Wu Yueling was in this space. Seeing Wu Yueling running around Viney with a faint smile on her face, she felt even stranger.</p> <p>Wasn’t Wu Yueling an autistic child? Why was she playing with someone else like a healthy child now?</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue had secretly told Viney that Wu Chengyue would come to pick the little one up soon, Viney had been expecting him while learning how to walk from Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Viney was now able to sense the vibes, scents, and noises from the outside world through Lin Qiao; her range of sensing was about a hundred meters in radius.</p> <p>She wasn’t able to see the outside world, but could differentiate the good vibes from the bad ones. She told Lin Qiao that she wasn’t able to exit the space, and that wasn’t a lie. However, there was one thing that she didn’t tell Lin Qiao: even though her body couldn’t leave the base, her vines were actually able to sneak out! To do that, she needed to touch Lin Qiao’s body.</p> <p>At this moment, Yuan Tianxing and the others who were in the living room on the outside had been staring at the few long, jade-white vines which came from an unknown source with astonishment. Those vines were wriggling all over the living room, showing no sign of attacking them though.</p> <p>Those vines looked a little familiar to some of them.</p> <p>“Where… are these from?”</p> <p>Those people sat on the couches in shock as they watched those vines touch everything in the living room. Soon, those vines reached and moved around them.</p> <p>At that moment, someone suddenly pushed the door open. Xing Le walked in excitedly and said, “There’s the news… Eh? What are these?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and responded, “I don’t know. Don’t attack them yet. Let’s see what they want. They aren’t showing any bad intentions.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen glanced at Xing Le, then turned back to stare at those jade-white vines while asking, “How are things going over there? Did Yang Chao die?”</p> <p>Xing Le carefully walked to the couches. As those vines suddenly reached toward him, he immediately stopped moving, gazing at them while answering Lin Wenwen’s question.</p> <p>“He died. I heard that he became some kind of ugly monster, and that even Chief Wu’s lightning attack couldn’t hurt him. At last, he was killed joint-handedly by another Chief in this base and Deputy Chief Xiao.”</p> <p>After saying that, he curiously looked at Lin Wenwen’s short hair. He had yet to get used to her new look, but he didn’t say a word about that.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the others fixed their eyes on those vines while asking Xing Le in one voice, “He transformed?”</p> <p>Viney quietly touched everything in the living room, then drew back her vines. Before long, those vines disappeared in front of Yuan Tianxing and the others.</p> <p>After watching those vines turn transparent bit by bit and then disappear, those people finally sighed with relief.</p> <p>“Did they go away?” said Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>“I think… so…” One of the others responded.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing thought for a moment, then said uncertainly, “I think that was the vine plant in Miss. Lu’s space…”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Wenwen both recalled Viney. Yuan Tianxing hadn’t seen her, so he confusedly looked at Du Yuanxing. Xing Le looked around alertly. Only after confirming that those white vines had truly gone did he sigh and relax.</p> <p>Then, he said to the others, “I heard that Yang Chao was running some kind of secret experiment related to the zombie virus, and he used living human beings from the base for it. During the past few months, hundreds of people in this base have disappeared, all kidnapped by Yang Chao. Now, they’ve all been found.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and the others looked at him in shock. “He ran experiments on living human beings? What experiments? It must be something evil, as he even needed to secretly kidnap people for that!” Lin Wenwen said angrily.</p> <p>Xing Le nodded, “Yes. He extracted the zombie virus from zombie blood, then diluted and injected it into human bodies. The commoners would die immediately after the injection. Only the superpowered people were able to suppress the virus.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing frowned while asking, “Why did he inject the diluted virus into human bodies?”</p> <p>“I think he was trying to attain some kind of power,” said Xing Le, “He became a monster at last. He wasn’t even afraid of lightning strikes after that, and only physical attacks could hurt him.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen had a guess, and said, “So, people could only use weapons to attack him? A bomb would have ended him, right?”</p> <p>Xing Le nodded in agreement, “You’re right. Bombs could indeed give him some harm. However, he was way too fast. I’m afraid that he would be able to dodge the bomb before it went off. So, in the end, Deputy Chief Xiao killed him by piercing a metal stick into his head.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing remembered that Miss. Lu had mentioned a level-seven partner of Yuan Tianxing, so he asked, “Where’s his partner? Who is that man?”</p> <p>Xing Le looked at him and answered his question, “Ah, I heard that he’s a level-seven metal-powered man. But, he ran away without Yang Chao when he saw the situation going bad.”</p> <p>“He ran away?” The others exclaimed out loud with surprise.</p>",
  "Chapter 368: About Baby": "<p>“Wasn’t he here to help Yang Chao? Why didn’t he help?” asked Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Xing Le shook his head and said, “I’m not sure. I heard that he ran away when Chief Wu and the others were attacking Yang Chao.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen showed a weird expression, as she didn’t know if she should laugh or not, “Was Yang Chao pissed off?”</p> <p>“I would be if I were him,” said Xing Le.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and said, “That’s understandable. Isn’t Yang Chao’s ally a post-apocalyptic robber? Robbers can never be trusted. That robber definitely wouldn’t risk his own life for Yang Chao.”</p> <p>“Maybe Yang Chao didn’t pay him enough for him to risk his life,” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at her and nodded, “You’re right.”</p> <p>“Chief Wu is going to get busy next. What just happened in this base will greatly affect the people here. Also, the winter is coming,” Du Yuanxing, who stood beside Yuan Tianxing, crossed his arms before his chest and said.</p> <p>“I found that ever since we met Miss. Lu, our situation has been turning for the better. We’ve already collected tons of supplies, so we don’t need to worry about getting through the coming winter,” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Hearing her, the others all realized that the preparation of the new base’s construction was going smoothly as well, and Miss. Lu had indeed found them great amounts of supplies.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the space, Lin Qiao successfully taught Viney how to walk, then sat on the couch and watched the two little things play with each other. She spent a moment sensing the outside world and heard the message that Xing Le brought back.</p> <p>“I need to get out for a while. You two stay here and play. Viney, don’t fall on the little one. If she gets hurt, I’ll spank you when I get back!” She said to Viney, then turned and disappeared.</p> <p>Lin Qiao trusted Viney, and believed that even if she fell, she wouldn’t fall on Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Viney was tossing the cluster of vines on her head from side to side. As Lin Qiao left, she held Wu Yueling’s hands and inched her way to a couch. Then, she held the couch and moved around it, as slow as a turtle.</p> <p>Wu Yueling quietly followed behind her, circling around the couch.</p> <p>Viney held Wu Yueling’s hand with a vine, then said, <em>‘Why isn’t your Daddy here yet? We’ve been waiting forever…’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at Viney confusedly while responding in her mind, <em>‘I don’t know when Daddy will show up. Daddy said he’ll come soon…’</em></p> <p>Viney sighed, sounding like an adult, <em>‘I was going to find my Mama a random man. The one outside named Yuan Tianxing is not bad… But, since you said that you like my Mama, I have no choice but to save her for your Daddy… But, your Daddy is so low…”</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at her without fully understanding her meaning. <em>‘If your Mama left with another man… she can’t be my Mama, can she? </em>‘ she asked.</p> <p>Viney answered her question, <em>‘Of course not! If that happens, Mama will have a little baby with that man… And, that will be me! Haha… Don’t tell your Daddy and my Mama about this… This is our secret… We can’t let them know… </em>‘</p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at her bewilderedly, saying, <em>‘Eh? Why will you become a little baby? Will my Daddy have a baby with your Mama after he came in? </em>‘</p> <p>Viney blinked and gave a smile. Her eyes curved like a pair of crescents as she snickered and said to Wu Yueling, <em>‘Hehe, that’s right! If your Daddy comes in, I’ll make him have a baby together with my Mama… And then, I’ll become that little baby… I’ll be calling you sister… In the future, I’ll be your little sister… </em>‘</p> <p>Wu Yueling didn’t understand every word that Viney said, but hearing Viney say that she would become her little sister, the little girl suddenly had her eyes glowed and looked at Viney with surprise.</p> <p><em>‘Really? Really </em>?’ she asked.</p> <p>Viney, who was walking before her, turned her whole body around. She wanted to only turn her head but couldn’t, because she didn’t have a neck.</p> <p>She tossed her vine hair to the other side, then said to Wu Yueling, <em>‘It’s real, it’s real </em>!’</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Yueling was immediately thrilled. She abruptly spread her arms to hug Viney. Thankfully, Viney was able to stand quite steadily even though she still shambled when walking. Otherwise, she would have been pressed to the ground by Wu Yueling.</p> <p><em>‘Ah, are you so happy about that </em>?’ said Viney to Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Wu Yueling’s adorable little face was already wearing a big smile. Her black, glowing eyes had also curved like a pair of crescents when she nodded quickly at Viney.</p> <p><em>‘If you didn’t come here today, I might have let someone else be my Daddy. If that happened, I wouldn’t be your little sister </em>,’ Viney suddenly thought about that.</p> <p>Once she said that, the smile on Wu Yueling’s face froze. The little girl gazed at Viney as if she was picturing Viney as some other people’s little sister.</p> <p>With that thought, she became unhappy.</p> <p>She looked at Viney, her cherry-like little lips instantly curved downward and her crescent-like eyes suddenly turning red and misty. Seeing that look on her face, Viney knew that something not good was happening. <em>‘Ahyaya, this is bad </em>!’</p> <p>As Wu Yueling was about to cry, the little vine plant panicked. She hurriedly began shaking the vines on her head and swinging like a roly-poly toy to cheer Wu Yueling up.</p> <p><em>‘Alright, alright, don’t cry, don’t cry… If Mama came in and saw you cry, she’ll spank me on the butt… Although, even I don’t know where my butt is…’</em></p> <p>Viney was confused for a moment when mentioning butt, but soon forgot about that, because she had a little girl to be cheered.</p> <p><em>‘Good little one… You see, you see, you’re already here, right? So, I won’t become some other man’s little baby… Don’t worry, don’t worry…’</em></p> <p>However, Wu Yueling’s lips curved even further down. She even raised a little hand to wipe her streaming tears. She cried pretty sadly, but didn’t make any sounds.</p> <p>Silent cry…</p> <p>Viney didn’t know what to do. <em>‘Oh my, oh my, don’t cry, please don’t cry… What should I do… Mama, help!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao had gone out and had a short conversation with Yuan Tianxing and the others. However, Viney summoned her before long.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little confused, as she didn’t know what had happened. She flashed into the space and saw that Wu Yueling was crying while Viney was rolling on the ground before her.</p> <p>“What are you doing? I’ve been out for less than three minutes… Why’s the little one crying?”</p> <p>Viney immediately stood up from the ground, then reached a vine to Lin Qiao’s hand. Then, she coiled the vine around Lin Qiao’s arm and dragged herself toward Lin Qiao, hanging on her arm.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, Mama, the little one suddenly cried… Viney doesn’t know why she cried… Maybe she’s missing her Daddy…’ </em>While speaking, she turned and winked at Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Wu Yueling was crying, but still, she remembered what Viney said to her earlier, about keeping the secret of the little baby from Zombie Sister.</p> <p>She sobbed while looking at Lin Qiao with a pair of red eyes and nodding. She wanted to tell Lin Qiao that she did miss her Daddy, which was indeed true…</p>",
  "Chapter 369: Viney Causes Troubles": "<p>Lin Qiao smiled at her and said, “You’ve only parted from your Daddy for a couple of hours, and you’re still missing him? No wonder your Daddy brought you with him every time he carried a mission. He must be quite tired, as he needs to take care of you while being a Chief.”</p> <p>Wu Yueling didn’t quite understand Lin Qiao’s words, but did grasp some information from what she said—she said that her Daddy was tired.</p> <p>She knew what tired meant. It meant that someone did many, many works, then ran out of strength.</p> <p>That was what her Daddy told her.</p> <p>Would Daddy be less tired if Zombie Sister helped him with all the works? She really liked Zombie Sister, and Daddy also said that he wanted to find Ling Ling a Mom…</p> <p>With those thoughts, Wu Yueling suddenly pounced on Lin Qiao and hugged her thigh.</p> <p><em>‘Zombie Sister is Daddy’s wife! I can’t let anyone have her!’</em></p> <p>When Wu Yueling touched her, Lin Qiao just sensed the little girl’s thoughts. And then, her face turned dark.</p> <p><em>‘What the hell? When did I become her Daddy’s wife? Kids shouldn’t talk nonsense!’</em></p> <p>She hurriedly pulled Wu Yueling away from her thigh, then squatted and looked at her in the eyes while asking, “Ling Ling, who told you that I’m your Daddy’s wife? If you said that to your Daddy, he’d definitely spank you!”</p> <p>Hearing Lin Qiao’s words, Viney immediately froze. <em>‘No, no, this is bad… The little one is too little to keep secrets!’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling only shook her head at Lin Qiao. After thinking for a moment, she nodded, then made a quick step forward and held Lin Qiao’s arm, clinging on her tightly.</p> <p>As a result, Lin Qiao now had a little one on each of her arms.</p> <p>She didn’t know what to say anymore. <em>‘It seems that something important has just happened, am I right? </em>‘ she thought.</p> <p>As Wu Yueling was about to leak the secret, Viney got anxious. Abruptly, she said to Lin Qiao, <em>‘Mama, Mama, I’m ready repair your body for the last time… Mama, follow me down to the lake now…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao had no idea that Viney was trying to distract her. Hearing what the latter said, she was instantly attracted, “Eh? You’re ready? Didn’t you say that I need to find another person to do that?’</p> <p><em>‘You can’t find that person for now,’ </em>said Viney <em>, ‘So Mama, you can get down there alone. It’ll also work…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know that the smart little Viney was tricking her. With hesitation, she asked, “Really? Don’t we need other people?”</p> <p>In fact, she was relieved silently on hearing that. Where should she go to find a man that she liked?</p> <p>However, she felt that what Viney said just now was a little contradictory to what she said earlier. So, she asked with a good deal of suspicion, “You won’t lie to me, will you?”</p> <p>Viney felt slightly guilty, but stayed calm without showing it to Lin Qiao. <em>‘Viney won’t lie to Mama,’ </em>she said.</p> <p>On the inside, she responded, <em>‘Mama, you refused to find a man yourself, so Viney has found one for you! When it starts to happen, I’ll be hiding in your belly! You won’t be able to find me!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao knew nothing about her plan. If she did, she might have vomited blood.</p> <p>“Alright then,” she nodded at Viney and said. Then, she thought about something else. “Little one, your daddy is coming soon. I’ll send you out now, in case he can’t find you when he arrives.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Yueling was fluttered. She hurriedly turned to Viney. The latter only narrowed her eyes toward the little girl.</p> <p>Seeing that, Wu Yueling stopped worrying, then obediently let Lin Qiao send her out.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and the others witnessed Lin Qiao show up in the living room, stay for a few minutes, then disappear again. A couple of minutes later, she showed up again with the little princess.</p> <p>“I’ll be staying in my space to upgrade these days. You should be careful. Even though the hidden dangers from Yang Chao don’t exist anymore, he might still have other confederates, and that robber. So, you all need to be careful,” Lin Qiao put the little one on a couch, then said to Yuan Tianxing and the others.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded at her and said, “I won’t go out before you come out of the space.”</p> <p>She knew that among all people on the scene, she faced the greatest danger because she wasn’t capable of protecting herself yet.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her and said, “I’m glad that you understand.” Then, she looked at Wu Chengyue and continued, “I think Wu Chengyue will come here soon to pick her up. I wonder why he sent her here.”</p> <p>Wu Yueling raised her head to look at Lin Qiao, then abruptly held her hand.</p> <p><em>‘I asked Daddy to send me here… I wanted to play with Viney…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her with surprise, saying, “Eh? You did that? Alright, will you be a good girl and stay here to wait for your Daddy to pick you up, okay?” While speaking, she rubbed Wu Yueling’s soft hair.</p> <p>Wu Yueling nodded at her, then raised her little hands to wipe the tears off her face.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at Lin Qiao with puzzlement in his eyes, saying, “Are you going to upgrade again? Upgrading is supposed to be dangerous for zombies, but I feel that’s not true for you.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned to him and responded, “Sure not. Do I still look like a zombie now?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “Alright, you’re special. But, your friends aren’t like normal zombies either. That’s also because of you, right?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him in the eyes and blinked, then showed a faint smile in those green eyes while saying to him, “For some things, you should keep them in your mind instead of saying them out loud.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen had a trace of delight flashing across her face when she was observing the look in Lin Qiao’s eyes.</p> <p>That was it! That smiling, threatening look… She had seen that look plenty of times before. Back then, Lin Hao was always the one being threatened. Her big sister doted on her, and never threatened her.</p> <p>She wanted to laugh every time she saw the look on Lin Hao’s face after he was threatened. Yuan Tianxing was now wearing the same not-so-happy look.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing was a little uncomfortable now. Alright, he mentioned Lin Qiao’s secret out loud without thinking; and in return, she threatened in front of so many people and made him lose face!</p> <p>“Alright, alright, I get it.” The displeased Yuan Tianxing also had a weird feeling. That familiar way of threatening… He thought that he would never experience it again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then flashed into her space. After entering her space, she found Viney happily swimming in the lake.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao, the latter quickly swam toward her.</p> <p>She wasn’t able to walk quickly on the ground, but in the water, she swam as nimbly and happily as a fish.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked around, then walked to the clearing before a little space and dragged a chair to the lakeside. She stood by the chair and began taking off her clothes. She didn’t care if Shen Yujen, who was staying in that small space, would watch her or not.</p> <p>Anyway, Shen Yujen didn’t watch her. Upon finding that Lin Qiao was actually stripping herself by the lake, she moved into the small space while feeling a little awkward. Even though she was very curious about why Lin Qiao took off her clothes, she didn’t think it was appropriate to see her naked.</p> <p>So, she suppressed her curiosity.</p>",
  "Chapter 370: Wu Chengyue Arrives": "<p>Lin Qiao took off her clothes and hat, then walked into the water naked; her hair were still super short.</p> <p>“Viney, I need to talk to you about my hair. Can you make my hair grow slightly longer this time? Even though my hair can grow by themselves now, I’ll still have to wait for one or two months before I can show them to the others!” While speaking, she walked toward the lake.</p> <p>Viney stooped before her, then held her hand with a vine and said, <em>‘Hmm… em… If there’s a man doing this together with us, Mama’s hair will grow long… But, there isn’t a man now, so Mama, your hair can’t grow.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>Why did it require a man?</p> <p>“You’re a kid. Don’t always talk about me finding a man. Aren’t you ashamed?”</p> <p>Viney rolled her big eyes toward Lin Qiao, saying, <em>‘Viney isn’t ashamed… hm…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know what to say. <em>‘Who are her parents? I just don’t have any control over this kid!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao walked into the lake while thinking. As the water reached her chest, she raised her arms and dove down. Viney swam around her like a large, jade-white octopus; her six root legs and the cluster of vine hair were paddling in the water. Meanwhile, she reached out a few vines to drag Lin Qiao down to the bottom of the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had been at the bottom once, so she knew that the lake was very deep. This time, being dragged by Viney, she found that she was sinking down really quickly. More specifically, Viney was diving down quite quickly.</p> <p>Before long, they arrived at the bottom of the lake and landed on the dark-red ground.</p> <p>Viney planted her six little root legs into the ground. After that, Lin Qiao popped her eyes and watched the other’s body and the veins grow larger and larger, longer and larger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was shocked while standing on the bottom of the lake, looking at Viney’s huge body.</p> <p>If they were on the outside, Viney’s body would have occupied about three or four hundred meters squared area.</p> <p>Seeing the countless leg-thick vines dancing in the water, Lin Qiao’s scalp was a little numb.</p> <p>At that point, Viney’s eyes weren’t of a regular size anymore. Lin Qiao raised her head and looked at those enormous green eyes that were glowing among those vines like two searchlights.</p> <p>At that very moment, Lin Qiao felt she herself was just a tiny being.</p> <p>What a huge vine!</p> <p>Viney reached down a few small vines to coil around Lin Qiao’s body, then wrapped her up layer by layer. Lin Qiao had experienced that for a few times before. So, she was already used to being wrapped in Viney’s vines by now.</p> <p>She lost her eyesight temporarily while a great amount of green energy started seeping into her skin. That numb and itchy feeling made her want to give a long sigh, as it felt comfortable and nice.</p> <p>As a zombie, she was actually able to feel that. She wasn’t sure if it was good or bad.</p> <p>Recalling that last time Wu Chengyue bit her on her thigh, she felt that her current body was really sensitive. It was like her old skin had fallen off, and her new skin was still growing. Even a slight touch would stimulate her tactile nervous system.</p> <p>Soon, she sensed a warmth spiraling in her stomach and expanding from her stomach. It reached to her lower abdomen from her arm, then went up to her chest. It was circulating up and down regularly.</p> <p>While Viney was helping Lin Qiao enter the repairing mode, Wu Chengyue arrived on the outside.</p> <p>“Chief Wu is here,” Wei Jingchen opened the door to inform the people in the living room as he saw Wei Jingchen show up on the stairs. Yuan Tianxing and the others weren’t surprised. It was already two o’clock in the afternoon. No matter how busy Chief Wu had been, he should have completed a phase by now.</p> <p>“Chief Wu is here to pick up little Ling Ling, right?” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“I think so. Ling Ling, your daddy is here,” Yuan Tianxing looked at Wu Yueling and said.</p> <p>After Lin Qiao went back into her space, Wu Yueling had been sitting on the couch and spending time alone, without talking to anyone else. Hearing Yuan Tianxing say that her Daddy was here, she immediately turned to look at the door, but didn’t get off the couch.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was still wearing that long and formfitting military coat, along with a pair of army boots. As he walked in, the lower hem of his coat swayed gently along with the wind stirred up by his movements.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, Daddy is here to pick you up,” Wu Chengyue walked in with a faint smile. He nodded at Yuan Tianxing at first, then talked to Wu Yueling. However, his precious daughter didn’t rush to him at the sight of him as he expected.</p> <p>Before, his daughter would react so every time after she spent some time alone in a strange environment.</p> <p>However, she did not do that this time.</p> <p>Following behind Wu Chengyue, were Meng Yue and Moli.</p> <p>The data that Moli had was very important. She was also a researcher, so Wu Chengyue was worried that an accident might happen to her like what happened to Liang Dashu. Therefore, he asked her to follow him after she handed him the data.</p> <p>“Congratulations, Chief Wu! You’ve successfully cleaned out all the people who were against you. From now on, this base will be ruled by only two leaders. The base was divided into three parts, but in the future, they will merge into two,” Yuan Tianxing said to Wu Chengyue with a grin. After all, Wu Chengyue had prepared for long before attaining this opportunity to strike back and win. Even though Miss. Lu had been causing troubles, he still achieved a rich harvest.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and responded, “That’s nothing. Your new base will be greater than ours.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing pointed at a couch and offered him a seat while saying, “It’s still too early to talk about that. It’ll require two or three years for us to build the base.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue sat down beside Wu Yueling and said, “Two or three years, that’s not a long time. It’ll pass real soon.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded in agreement, “You’re right.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced around, then asked, “Where’s Miss. Lu? Why isn’t she here? I want to thank her for what she did this morning. Without her help, I might not have been able to find a reason to get rid of Yang Chao so fast officially.”</p> <p>His words sounded friendly, but Yuan Tianxing and the others dug out some other meanings from them. As they thought, that female zombie wouldn’t just stay quiet and watch! She was a trouble-maker!</p> <p>Lin Wenwen grinned and said, “Miss. Lu is in her space. She might not be able to come out now.”</p> <p>Before she continued talking, she raised her head and abruptly saw something strange. Then, she fixed her eyes on the top of Wu Chengyue’s head with astonishment.</p> <p>Noticing her reaction, the others all raised their heads to find a few white vines which were as thick as women’s lower legs, reaching down from the ceiling quickly toward Wu Yueling.</p> <p>Realizing what was happening, Wu Chengyue didn’t manage to make other reaction but pressed Wu Yueling into his arm without thinking</p>",
  "Chapter 371: This is Her Space": "<p>Before the others could react, Wu Chengyue—a level-seven superpowered man—and his daughter were both wrapped up by those weird vines and disappeared within a blink.</p> <p>“Chengyue!” The look on Meng Yue’s face changed drastically. She raised her head to look at where those vines were, but saw nothing. Those vines had wrapped Wu Chengyue and his daughter and vanished into thin air.</p> <p>At that moment, a vine that was as thick as a finger suddenly reached out of a corner and quietly coiled around Meng Yue’s hand, then quickly disappeared.</p> <p>Meng Yue paused for a second, then fell into silence with a strange expression.</p> <p>“Miss. Meng, how do you feel?” Seeing the look on her face, the others were confused. They weren’t worried about Wu Chengyue though. As a level-seven lightning-powered man, how could he possibly be afraid of those mysterious vines?</p> <p>Besides, none of them had sensed any intent of attacking from that vine, not to mention the intent of killing. That was the reason why Wu Chengyue reacted slowly. If those vines had a vicious intent, they would have been turned into ashes by Wu Chengyue’s lightning strikes the moment they showed up.</p> <p>Meng Yue looked at the others confusedly and said, “That weird vine delivered a message to me. It said—’I need to borrow a man’… What does that mean?”</p> <p><em>‘I need to borrow a man?’</em></p> <p>The people were all bewildered, then felt that those vines had really made a great choice. They actually picked the strongest man in the room.</p> <p>“Eh… They borrowed Chief to do what?”</p> <p>The others shook their heads, all feeling utterly confused. They had nothing but puzzlement in their eyes.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Chengyue who was suddenly dragged into Lin Qiao’s space, was also in confusion. Wu Yueling was held in his arms. Once they came to this place, those white vines disappeared.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue alertly looked around and found that he was standing beside a strange lake. He automatically made a few steps backward to get away from the water, then turned his head to observe the surrounding environment.</p> <p>There was a grassland and some furniture pieces, along with strange-looking woods. Apart from those, the area miles away was all foggy, and so was the sky. The sky seemed to have been covered by a thick layer of fog.</p> <p>He moved his hands, but then had his expression change. He held Wu Yueling with one hand and put the other before his face. Electric currents had been sizzling in his palm, but were much weaker than before.</p> <p>Those tiny electric currents flashed in his palm.</p> <p>He raised his head to look at the sky, but wasn’t able to sense even the slightest lightning power from it, as if the connection between him and the sky was cut off. He could still feel the sky, but couldn’t generate any lightning power anymore.</p> <p>Simply speaking, his power was suppressed in this place. At this moment, he couldn’t release ten, or even five percent of his power.</p> <p>When the alarmed Wu Chengyue was trying to figure out what was going on, Wu Yueling suddenly twisted her body and slid out of his arm.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, don’t run! This place is dangerous!” Wu Chengyue gave a start and hurriedly stopped her. However, Wu Yueling shook her head at him, then pointed at a small space.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked that way and saw a figure flashing across.</p> <p>“Who’s there! Come out!” He gave a shout.</p> <p>Shen Yujen carefully walked out of the small space, looking at him with confusion. There was a long distance between them, so Wu Chengyue had to give her a close look to recognize her.</p> <p>“You are… Jen?”</p> <p>He knew Chen Yuting’s wife. Upon seeing Shen Yujen, he was slightly surprised.</p> <p>Shen Yujen slowly walked over and stopped three meters from him, then nodded.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at her from head to toe questioningly, then asked her, “It’s really you! You’re a… You’re a zombie now, right? Was it really you who bit Piao Gecang?”</p> <p>Shen Yujen looked at him timidly and nodded.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue calmed down, then looked around and said, “So this place is her space, isn’t it? “Where is she? Why did she suddenly bring us in?”</p> <p>Shen Yujen pointed at the lake, then shook her head at him.</p> <p>She had no idea why Wu Chengyue suddenly showed up in Lin Qiao’s space, but she knew that Lin Qiao had gone down into the lake earlier and hadn’t yet come up.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at the lake surface, then turned back and asked her, “What do you mean? You… Can’t you speak?”</p> <p>Shen Yujen shook her head at him, then nodded.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue rummaged through his pockets, then found a notepad and a pen.</p> <p>“Here, write down what you want to say.”</p> <p>Shen Yujen obediently walked to him before taking over the notepad and pen, then wrote—’She went down into the lake, hasn’t come up yet.’</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at her bewilderedly, then read the note again. After that, he turned to the lake with confusion and said, “In the lake? What is she doing in the lake?”</p> <p>Beside his legs, Wu Yueling has been turning to the lake from time to time.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at Shen Yujen and asked, “You’re already awake, but why aren’t you with Chen Yuting? Does he know that you’ve woken up?”</p> <p>Shen Yujen lowered her head with a sad face. Looking at the stones on the ground, she shook her head again.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave her a few glances, then seemed to understand her meaning. “You don’t want him to see your current look, right? You should know that he wouldn’t mind how you look now. He doesn’t even care that you’re a zombie. Why are you still worried about it?”</p> <p>Shen Yujen raised her head to look at him, her eyes showing a strong feeling.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue continued blandly, “Your relationship with him is about both of you. You’re suffering here, and he is dealing with an even greater pain outside. You can’t only think about yourself. If you love him, I think you shouldn’t hide from him.”</p> <p>The feeling showing in Shen Yujen’s eyes grew even stronger. If she were still a healthy human being, her tears would have streamed out of her eye sockets.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was right. The relationship was about both of them. She was hiding here alone, and that was unfair for Chen Yuting.</p> <p>However, she wasn’t yet ready to go out and see him.</p> <p>“You have taken your revenge and realized your wish. Just go back and live a life with him…” While speaking, Wu Chengyue suddenly twitched his nose as if he sensed some kind of smell. “Have you sensed some kind of smell? It’s a little weird…” he asked Shen Yujen.</p> <p>Shen Yujen sniffed at the air, but then confusedly shook her head; she had detected no smell at all.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue lowered his head to look at Wu Yueling and ask her, “Ling Ling, have you sensed any smell?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling stuck her head out from behind his thigh and glanced up at him, then sniffed around in the air. After that, she nodded at her father to let him know that she had sensed that strange smell as well.</p> <p>That smell wasn’t unpleasant, but neither was it sweet or refreshing. It was just a little strange, and was quite strong.</p> <p>Shen Yujen looked at the two with surprise.</p> <p>Was there a smell? But she smelled nothing. Was it because she was a zombie?</p>",
  "Chapter 372: Strip Wu Chengyue": "<p>Wu Yueling curiously sniffed around. She felt that that smell was really strange; but somehow, the more she sensed it, the more she wanted to continue.</p> <p>While she was sensing that smell, a drowsy feeling crept over her. Thankfully, she was familiar with this place. As she felt sleepy, she walked to a bed and climbed onto it.</p> <p>After sensing that strange smell, Wu Chengyue froze.</p> <p>Shen Yujen looked at Wu Yueling, knowing that she was safe in this place. After that, she raised her head to look at Wu Chengyue and found that the look on his face was a little strange.</p> <p>She waved a hand before his face, then patted him on his arm.</p> <p>He actually made no response. His handsome face was wearing no expression, and his eyes were unfocused. The electric currents in his palms were long gone.</p> <p><em>‘What… what happened?’</em></p> <p>Shen Yujen looked at Wu Chengyue in shock and patted him a little harder. But still, he remained standing motionless and dull.</p> <p>She turned to look at Wu Yueling, only to find that the latter was already lying asleep on the bed, cuddling in a quilt.</p> <p>While wondering what to do next, Shen Yujen suddenly sensed a wave of energy from the lake. She hurriedly turned to the lake, and then saw a few long vines reaching out of the water, toward Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>She was very scared of Viney’s vibe. Therefore, as Viney showed up and approached her, she immediately turned and ran, leaving Wu Chengyue standing there.</p> <p><em>‘This is Miss. Lu’s space anyway. I think she won’t hurt Chief…’ </em>she thought.</p> <p>The three or four vines reached to Wu Chengyue, who was about twenty meters away from the lake. They circled around him for a while, poking his face, chest, his waist that had smooth lines, and even his butt.</p> <p>Shen Yujen hid in a small space, looking at Wu Chengyue with a complicated expression, as those vines seemed to have been harassing him.</p> <p><em>‘Hm… It should be right. They are indeed harassing him!’</em></p> <p>Soon, her guess was proven right.</p> <p>That was because Viney started to rip Wu Chengyue’s clothes. After tearing off his belt, Viney didn’t try to undo his buttons. Her thick vines weren’t able to complete skilled works like that anyway.</p> <p>Two vines crawled into his collar, while the other two pinched the hem of his coat, and then violently pulled the coat in two different directions. Following a series of slight noise, his army coat was ripped open. The buttons fell off, bouncing on the ground.</p> <p>Then, his shirt and the slender pants were both damaged by Viney.</p> <p>Shen Yujen covered her eyes. Through the spaces between her fingers, she watched her Chief who had a dull face at the moment, being stripped by a… a plant.</p> <p>Soon enough, she saw Wu Chengyue’s sturdy yet not-overly-developed, charmingly shaped muscles.</p> <p>After watching Viney tear off Wu Chengyue’s underwear, Shen Yujen hurriedly closed her eyes and turned around.</p> <p><em>‘Will Chief kill me to shut me up? But, Chief is in really great shape!’</em></p> <p>With her back to Wu Chengyue, Shen Yujen silently swallowed her saliva, as her head was now full of Wu Chengyue’s tall and slim and muscular body, and his long and straight legs.</p> <p><em>‘I already have Yuming… Chief is pretty, but not my type!’</em></p> <p>On the other side, Wu Chengyue was wearing a dull face, but was actually fully awake. At that moment, he was nearly breaking down.</p> <p><em>‘What the hell! What on earth is happening now? Why can’t I move?’</em></p> <p>He was still able to see, but everything in his eyes was blurry. However, he clearly sensed what had happened to him.</p> <p>He was stripped by someone!</p> <p>No, not someone… It was a few white vines which stripped him!</p> <p><em>‘What in the world does that female zombie have in her space? And those things are so lecherous!’</em></p> <p>As he started to feel chilly, he found that he was dragged, walking toward the lake.</p> <p>He was panicked and confused, not knowing what would happen next. His clothes had been taken off. Those vines wouldn’t make him do something bad, would they?</p> <p>Or… Was he going to be raped again?</p> <p>Thinking of that, he was strongly unhappy.</p> <p>He felt that his naked body was automatically walking toward the lake. As he got closer to the lakeside, he suddenly saw a chair there, and a neatly folded pile of clothes on it.</p> <p><em>‘Whose closes are these? Is someone else in this lake? Can it be that female zombie?’</em></p> <p>His power had disappeared completely, maybe because he was in someone’s space. Something in this place had been limiting his superpower.</p> <p>He watched his own feet step into the lake water, then sensed a coolness against his skin. Before long, he found that he was able to make expressions again, but his body didn’t stop walking into the lake.</p> <p>That was because a few vines were wrapping around his arms and waist, dragging him down with an irresistible strength.</p> <p><em>‘Are these vines going to drown me in this lake? Or, why are they dragging me down?’</em></p> <p>However, he found that he was wrong when he went down into the lake and the water got over his head. The water didn’t disable him from breathing, as if he was able to breathe underwater.</p> <p>The water was clear, but the lake was deep and dark. He couldn’t see what was in the lake, and felt that no creature existed in the water at all, as he didn’t even see one fish or shrimp.</p> <p>Those vines kept dragging him down. Abruptly, countless more vines reached out and wrapped his entire body up.</p> <p>He wanted to struggle, but couldn’t control his body. Without being able to struggle, he watched those strange vines wrap him into a cocoon.</p> <p>He didn’t know how deep he had gone, but suddenly, he spotted a vine cocoon below him, about five feet and four inches tall. The more he looked at it, the more he felt that a person was wrapped in it.</p> <p>He couldn’t help but think about his own situation. Did he look the same as that cocoon now?</p> <p>The cold vines wrapped his body pretty tightly. The vines weren’t squeezing him, so he hadn’t been feeling uncomfortable; but those vines didn’t show any sign of letting him go either.</p> <p>He suddenly felt that he had regained the control of his body; he was able to control himself again. He tried to move his limbs, then realized that even though his body was back under his control, he wasn’t able to free himself from all these vines wrapped on him.</p> <p>Right at that moment, he sensed a refreshing stream of energy flowing into his body through his pores, gathering toward his lower abdomen.</p> <p>That refreshing energy was cool at first, but soon after entering his body, it began warming up. When reaching his lower abdomen, it had become boiling hot.</p>",
  "Chapter 373: The Entrapped Two": "<p>The heat began spreading all over his body. It didn’t bring him any discomfort; on the contrary, it felt quite good. He felt as if he was bathing in a slightly warm water. After the lightly unbearable heat at first, he was quite relaxed.</p> <p>He felt that all of his pores had opened. Letting out a long breath, the heat inside him made him really comfortable.</p> <p>That feeling lasted for tens of seconds, and then, he felt light and weightless. His brain stopped working to enjoy that floating feeling.</p> <p>But before long, he couldn’t stay calm anymore, because the heat in his lower abdomen had been growing stronger and stronger. Gradually, it had nowhere to go, and accumulated in his lower belly.</p> <p>He felt dizzy and thirsty; his throat was dry. He was eager to vent the burning hotness in his lower belly, but didn’t know how.</p> <p>That unpleasant feeling made his mind slightly clearer.</p> <p>Why did he now feel as if he had taken some kind of aphrodisiac potion?</p> <p>At that moment, he no longer cared why he became like this, or why was he suddenly dragged into that female zombie’s space. He just wanted to give a vent to his pent-up desire! He even wanted to do it with his own hand.</p> <p>However, he couldn’t move!</p> <p>The heat in his lower belly made him feel like he was burning in fire. Something was trapped in his heart, and that something was scratching him from the inside. He felt so itchy, but could not be saved.</p> <p>At that point, he suddenly sensed that his body was being moved by something. And then, those vines which had been wrapping him pretty tight began squirming. They weren’t letting him go, but moved slowly for unknown reasons.</p> <p>Before he could react, a naked person was put into his arms. Her smooth, warm back pressed against his chest.</p> <p>Feeling her skin, Wu Chengyue’s heart was shaken.</p> <p>All of a sudden, he felt that he was freed by those vines; and then, he automatically held the person in his arms. He turned his head to look around, and saw nothing but darkness. So, he reached out a hand.</p> <p>He found that those vines weren’t really freeing him, but only giving him a little space to move freely.</p> <p>Who was this suddenly appearing woman?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue put an arm around her waist. Her waist was slim and strong, and above that should be soft breasts. Wu Chengyue managed to stop himself from putting a hand on those breasts.</p> <p>At that very moment, Lin Qiao had an impulse to die!</p> <p>Not long ago, she was absorbing the energy that Viney delivered to her. As she felt very comfortable and forgot about the time, her back suddenly pressed on someone else’s body. Then, she felt a strong arm around her waist, and something hard against her sensitive area.</p> <p>She gave a start, and was deeply confused.</p> <p><em>‘Who is that! Why is another person here!’</em></p> <p><em>‘Where the hell is this man from! Damn! Viney! What on earth are you doing!’</em></p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao felt Viney slightly loosen the grip on her; and then, she softly fell onto that man, being held by him tightly.</p> <p>She wanted to struggle, but as she was absorbing Viney’s energy just now, her body had become powerless, and her limbs were too limp to free herself.</p> <p>Soon, she felt a hand stroking all over her body… from her neck to her shoulders, then going downward…</p> <p>That man’s hand brought her a tingling and made her extremely uncomfortable.</p> <p>She felt that she was sold by Viney!</p> <p>Viney lied to her and let her come down alone; but in fact, she had already found her a man!</p> <p>She didn’t even know who that man was!</p> <p>While clenching her teeth with anger toward Viney and that man behind her, her mind was blurred from time to time by the movements that man’s restless hand.</p> <p>Suddenly, that hand touched her head. Lin Qiao sensitively sensed that the man seemed to have paused for a second.</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Chengyue was shocked when he touched Lin Qiao’s prickly scalp. He had already figured out who this bald woman was!</p> <p>Wasn’t she that female zombie?’</p> <p>Wu Chengyue wanted to push her again, but her soft body and smooth skin made him hesitate. However, he was clearly aware that she was a zombie! A zombie! Was he going to have sex with a zombie now?</p> <p>Even thinking about that made him feel unacceptable!</p> <p>He also wondered why didn’t the female zombie make any response. She was all soft, as if he could do anything he wanted to her.</p> <p><em>‘Let… go… of… me… Who are you…’</em></p> <p>Suddenly, a voice was heard in Wu Chengyue’s head and startled him. <em>‘Who is this? </em>‘ he asked silently.</p> <p><em>‘Hands… off… me.’</em></p> <p>That voice told him to get his hands off, so was it…</p> <p>Wu Chengyue held Lin Qiao’s waist tightly with both arms, then leaned his head against the back of her head. <em>‘Are you Miss. Lu? Was it you who dragged me in? What do you want? </em>‘ He asked in his head.</p> <p><em>‘Not… me…’ </em>He heard Lin Qiao’s weak voice <em>, ‘If you can control yourself… please let go of me…’</em></p> <p><em>‘So she can’t control herself right now.’ </em>Wu Chengyue thought in surprise, wondering what was happening to the female zombie. However, he didn’t do what Lin Qiao asked. Instead of letting her go, he pressed his body tightly on hers, even rubbing against her hip with his crotch area, intentionally or not.</p> <p><em>‘Too late! You dragged in me and started a fire. Now, you have put the fire out yourself.’</em></p> <p>Being rubbed by him, Lin Qiao’s body was softened. She nearly vomited blood.<em>‘Get away! I didn’t do it… Viney did it… You let go of me…’</em></p> <p>Wu Chengyue felt that his genitals were about to explode. But still, he controlled himself and chuckled in his mind as he said, <em>‘I don’t know who’s Viney, but I can’t possibly back off now.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao got anxious. <em>‘You… You know that I’m a… You’re going to… have sex with… a zombie…’</em></p> <p><em>‘I don’t care. I’ll do it even if you’re a sow </em>,’ Wu Chengyue laughed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was speechless for a moment.</p> <p>Was he calling her a sow? Was he? Was he!</p> <p><em>‘If you dare to touch me… I’ll castrate you when I get out… </em>‘ she said with rage.</p> <p><em>‘You can try! Come on, let’s do the important thing!’ </em>said Wu Chengyue. While speaking, he abruptly turned Lin Qiao around and made her face him.</p>",
  "Chapter 374: Renewed Body": "<p><em>‘This is bad </em>!’ Lin Qiao said to herself after she heard Wu Chengyue’s words. Her body was so limp that she wasn’t able to resist. She felt him turn her body around, and then they were face to face.</p> <p>That hard thing which was pressing on her hip was now straight against a certain area of her body.</p> <p>Next, he pressed his lips against hers. A soft, wet, and warm tongue erotically licked her lips, then forced open her mouth and broke in.</p> <p>Lin Qiao wasn’t breathing, so she didn’t feel suffocated. That tongue nimbly stirred in her mouth and brushed hard across her palate, then entangled with her tongue.</p> <p><em>‘… Who are you?’</em></p> <p>She still didn’t know who he was, but he had already known who she was. Wu Chengyue paused for a moment, feeling a little surprised.</p> <p><em>‘She asked who I am. Was it really not her who got me in here?’</em></p> <p>However, the refreshing and sweet taste in her mouth soon made Wu Chengyue forget about that question. He responded to her with one word while sucking her lips.</p> <p><em>‘Guess!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao even wanted to give him a bite. She hoped that she could bite off his tongue which was inside her mouth right now, but she was too weak to even do that at the moment.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was amazed. He never thought that the female zombie would actually taste quite nice. He wasn’t able to sense any smell at that moment, but did have a sweet taste in his mouth.</p> <p>Also, the female zombie had smooth skin and strong muscles.</p> <p>Lin Qiao began talking to Viney very angrily in her mind. By now, she surely had figured out who planned all this.</p> <p><em>‘Viney! Tell him to stop, or wait and see how I will punish you!’</em></p> <p>The vines around flinched a little, then a voice was heard in both of their minds.</p> <p><em>‘Viney is just helping you… Don’t stop. Ling Ling’s Daddy, you should take care of yourself after you get out, haha…’</em></p> <p>Viney’s laughter gave both of them a weird, cold feeling. However, Wu Chengyue soon forgot about that, as the man part of his body was suffering such a swelling pain.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt that he was quickening his movements. One of her legs was lifted and put around his strong waist.</p> <p>She gave a start, tightening her body as she said in her mind, <em>‘Stop! Ugh… </em>‘</p> <p>What she felt next was a sudden penetration. She sensed no pain, but that feeling which she had when he invaded her body was very uncomfortable… and weird!</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Such a rush!’</em></p> <p>All of a sudden, she felt as if her brain exploded. She lost the sensations of her body, and meanwhile, disordered images began flashing across her mind.</p> <p>She found herself sitting upon a naked man, looking down at the face of that man who was trying very hard to control his anger.</p> <p>She recognized that face. That man was Wu Chengyue!</p> <p>And then, the scene before her eyes changed. She found that she was walking in a base. She lowered herself and saw a pair of long, snow-white legs, wearing delicate heels. She also found herself lying underneath Yang Chao, moaning with a soft voice while looking at his face. His face wore no expressions, and his lower body was lunging ceaselessly.</p> <p>She knew that all these memories didn’t belong to her, but Lu Tianyu.</p> <p>At that moment, the images in her mind switched again. She was still lying on a bed, but on top of her was another man.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua!</p> <p>Her heart missed a beat. Why would that man appear in her memory?</p> <p>She saw Yang Jianhua squirming upon her with a pleasant expression; sweat dripping down his pretty face.</p> <p>“Relax, I won’t leave you… I’ll always be with you…’ Yang Jianhua’s lips were moving. He said something that she couldn’t hear all clearly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao suddenly woke up, and then the images in her head were all gone.</p> <p>Before she could try to find those memories, the sudden thrust sent a shiver to her entire body. She felt as if something hard suddenly broke into her heart, erasing that confused and helpless feeling which she had just now.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue paused after first invading her body.</p> <p>He froze, with surprise and doubts, arms still holding her soft body tightly. Just now, he felt that his genitals suddenly broke something, which disabled him from calming down.</p> <p><em>‘No way! This female zombie was actually a virgin? Did she never have sex with men before?’</em></p> <p>That guess made him stunned.</p> <p>At that point, a voice was heard in his mind, <em>‘This is because I repaired Mama’s body. I renewed it to its original state. You’re so lucky, Ling Ling’s Daddy!’</em></p> <p>Hearing those words, Wu Chengyue was astonished. With disbelief, he said in his mind, <em>‘You… Is what you said real? Who are you? </em>‘</p> <p><em>‘Didn’t Mama just tell you?’ </em>That voice responded, <em>‘I’m Viney </em>.’</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was speechless. He had thought that the female zombie was lying!</p> <p>Viney continued, <em>‘This is Mama’s new body. I renewed her body with my power. So now, you have her virginity… You need to be responsible for her…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Does your Mama know about this </em>?’ Wu Chengyue asked.</p> <p><em>‘Mama’s mind has fallen into the memory whirlpool, so she can’t feel what you’re doing now… She can only feel it after she wakes up… So, she doesn’t yet know that she just lost her virginity…’</em></p> <p>Wu Chengyue wasn’t sure if he was lucky, or if he had gotten into trouble.</p> <p>But soon, he was attracted by that feeling from his genitals which was wrapped in something soft. He surged into her body with a hard erosion, and that warm and tightly wrapped feeling made him sigh with relief. After breaking her hymen and hearing what Viney said, he now had some different thoughts generating in his heart.</p> <p>He soon made the decision and began swaying his hips, slowly but strongly bumping against her soft and rubbery body. He didn’t care if her body was repaired or renewed. At this very moment, he only wanted to relieve himself from that swelling pain.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao woke up, she sensed the violent bumps from her lower body. She felt no pain, but the quick lunges brought her a strange feeling in her chest.</p> <p>She felt that her chest was tightened. Every time when he pierced in, her heart would twitch, then cause a muffled pain.</p> <p><em>‘What the hell… Why is my chest hurting instead of my lower part? Do I have heart diseases?’ </em>she wondered.</p>",
  "Chapter 375: Finish and Go Ashore": "<p>Lin Qiao didn’t know how long it had been, and she only knew that she had been floating up and down, taking in that strong twitching pain from her chest and the tingling from her body along with the strong mood swings.</p> <p>A long white after her mind was blurred, she suddenly felt that the man had quickened his move.</p> <p><em>‘Em… b*stard…’</em></p> <p>She froze as a scorching hot wave of energy surged into her body from his. Then, she began trembling. Her consciousness was clouded, body floating in the water. She felt as if she was being washed away by some kind of flood that was intense and tempestuous.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue paused inside her for more than ten seconds because of the ejaculation before it finally ended.</p> <p>At that moment, the area was suddenly illuminated. Wu Chengyue looked at Lin Qiao who was in his arms, and couldn’t help but reach out a hand to touch her hair. He didn’t know when her hair grew long enough to drift in the water.</p> <p>Her hair were soft and smooth, and should be long enough to reach her chest. Because she was in the water, her hair had spread backward, fluttering in the water.</p> <p>Her eyes were closed, face delicate. Without seeing her purely black eyes, he found her really sweet-looking and beautiful. Her eyebrows were long and thin, eyelashes thick and curly; her nose was straight and nicely shaped, lips delicate and pink.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stared closely at her face, then began gently stroking it with a hand. Her body was in his arm, like a boneless mermaid.</p> <p>Suddenly, he felt that a part of his heart collapsed slowly, then was filled up again.</p> <p>He looked around and found that they were still in the water. The water was clear, without any vines or anything strange things.</p> <p>He put one of the female zombie’s long and slim arms around his neck, then began swimming up. The water surface seemed to be not far away, but he spent a long time in reaching there.</p> <p>He stuck his head out of the water and looked around to find his precious daughter squatting beside the chair by the lakeside. Wu Yueling had spotted him as well. She immediately fixed her sparkling eyes on him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue dragged Lin Qiao and swam to his daughter, then carried Lin Qiao in his arms and began walking ashore. Wu Yueling stood by the lakeside, waiting for them while thoughtfully holding her father’s clothes which had been destroyed by Viney.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, don’t look at Daddy. Turn around and close your eyes. Daddy is naked,” Wu Chengyue stood in the water and said to the little one when the water surface was around his waist.</p> <p>Wu Yueling obediently turned around with her back to Wu Chengyue, still holding those clothes. Only after that did Wu Chengyue carry Lin Qiao out of the water and walk toward a bed.</p> <p>He put Lin Qiao on a bed and covered her with a blanket. Then, he turned and walked to Wu Yueling before bending over behind her to take his clothes.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, Daddy is going to put on some clothes. You can’t open your eyes until Daddy tells you to, do you understand?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling nodded. After Wu Chengyue took away the clothes from her hands, she raised those hands to cover her eyes.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue searched through that pile of clothes that Wu Yueling had collected and found his ragged underwear.</p> <p>What expression should he make now to mourn over his torn underwear?</p> <p>No, he shouldn’t be mourning over his underwear now. Instead… what was he supposed to wear now? Nothing?</p> <p>Well, it wouldn’t feel good with that part of his body dangling between his legs, would it?</p> <p>He thought for a moment, then raised his head to look at the furniture area. There were a few closets, so he wondered if he could find any men’s underwear in one of them. However, as this space belonged to the female zombie, he guessed that she would only collect women’s wears.</p> <p>But still, he decided to give it a try. He walked there and opened those closets.</p> <p>The first one was filled with women’s wear.</p> <p>The second closet contained nothing but children’s wear.</p> <p>The third one… Men’s wear! All men’s wear!</p> <p>He delightedly found some brand-new men’s underwear from the bottom of that closet.</p> <p>After putting the underwear on, he conveniently found a shirt and pair of trousers that fit him before putting them on as well, because his army suit has already been torn into pieces by those vines.</p> <p>After that, he turned around to say to Wu Yueling, “Alright Ling Ling, come over.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Yueling immediately turned back and happily ran to him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue scooped her up, then sat on a couch and looked around. Suddenly, he said to the air, “You said your name is Viney, right? Can you send us out now? This female zombie… Well, this woman won’t wake up anytime soon, will she?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling sat on his lap and also raised her head to search around with her eyes. However, she was mainly looking at the lake.</p> <p>At that moment, a few large vines descended from the air. Those vines still had a jade-white color, but looked different from before. Now, they looked not quite real.</p> <p>Also, they were reaching down from the foggy sky, looking tens of thousands of feet long.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue and Wu Yueling both raised their heads to look at those vines from the sky with surprise. Some vines gently coiled around their hands, then a voice was heard, <em>‘Viney can send you out.’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling raised her head and slightly opened her mouth. <em>‘Why are you in the sky? Aren’t you in the lake anymore? Why don’t you come out? </em>‘ she looked at the vines and asked silently.</p> <p>Viney answered her questions, <em>‘I’m going to become a little baby, so I can’t come out now. I have to wait for Mama to give birth to me.’</em></p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Yueling nodded excitedly and said, <em>‘Will you be a little baby when you come out?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Yes, yes,’ </em>said Viney <em>, ‘But, you have to wait for a long time.’</em></p> <p><em>‘Alright!, </em>‘ replied Wu Yueling.</p> <p><em>‘What are you? What is your relationship with… her?’ </em>asked Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Viney said to him, <em>‘She’s my Mama, and I’m Viney </em>.’</p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t quite understand her answers, so he changed the topic,<em>‘How long will she stay like this? When will she wake up?’</em></p> <p>Viney said, <em>‘Mama has fallen into the memory whirlpool. She has to find a way out by herself. I don’t know how long it will take.’</em></p> <p>Wu Chengyue silently looked at Lin Qiao. <em>‘Her body is restored to a healthy human body. Have you been doing that for her?’</em></p> <p>Viney responded proudly, <em>“Yes, Yes! Viney’s power can repair zombies’ bodies and humans… But, my energy isn’t so effective for humans… I can only provide human beings with some healing effect…’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 376: Who should be Responsible for Whom": "<p>Wu Chengyue stayed silent for a while, then sighed, “It’s already amazing. Don’t tell anyone else about that. Do you understand?”</p> <p><em>‘I understand, Daddy </em>!’ said Viney happily. Wu Chengyue paused for a moment in shock, then immediately raised his head and asked confusedly, <em>‘Wait a moment, what did you just call me?”</em></p> <p><em>‘Daddy?’ </em>Viney responded <em>, ‘I’ll become a little baby of you and Mama when I got out.’</em></p> <p>Wu Yueling heard what Viney said to Wu Chengyue as well. She immediately patted Wu Chengyue’s hand and quickly nodded at him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue lowered his head to look at her and found the rarely seen happiness and anticipation in her eyes. <em>‘Ling Ling, do you understand what we’ve been talking about? Why are you so happy? Do you really want a little sister or brother? Or </em>…” He was given a headache.</p> <p>He paused briefly, then turned to Lin Qiao. Pointing at her, he asked Wu Yueling, “Do you want her to be your Mom?”</p> <p>He thought Wu Yueling would shake her head; but to her surprise, she nodded.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at her questioningly and asked her with a slightly weird expression, “Do you mean… you want her to be your step-mother?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling just couldn’t stop nodding.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at his daughter closely in the eyes. Suddenly, he had a thought. “Why do I feel that… you and this Viney have been keeping a secret from us? Do you know her well?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue confusedly looked at Wu Chengyue. Hearing his questions, she nodded. She didn’t know Viney really well, but they were good friends.</p> <p>Recalling how the female zombie reacted earlier, Wu Chengyue raised his head again and asked, “You didn’t let her know, did you? She doesn’t know who I am, right?”</p> <p>Viney remained silent for a while, then said, <em>‘That’s because the last repairment of Mama’s body is also a critical transformation of Viney. It required a man’s sperm and male energy to complete the process. Little Ling Ling said that she likes my Mama, so I asked Ling Ling if she’d like to call her Mama as well… Ling Ling said yes…’</em></p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at the vines with a meaningful expression on his face, saying, “So, you dragged me in here! You’re so bold. You didn’t even let your Mama know. You should wait and see how she punishes you when she wakes up!”</p> <p>He had sensed the female zombie’s wonderful taste. Now, he somehow had a wave of inexplicable anger rising in his heart as he thought that Viney could have brought another man in here and let him monopolize the female zombie’s body and sweet taste.</p> <p>A part of him was suddenly glad that it was he who came in here.</p> <p>He turned back to look at the female zombie who was lying quietly on the bed. Her sleeping face was beautiful; her super short hair had grown long, spreading on the pillow.</p> <p>He stood up and carried Wu Yueling to the bed, then sat on it to look at the female zombie’s face more closely.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, good job!” He abruptly turned to Wu Yueling and gave her a compliment, then continued, “From now on, you need to call her Mama. Do you understand?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Yueling smiled happily.</p> <p>Seeing the smile on Wu Yueling’s face, Wu Chengyue’s heart melted. He suddenly realized that ever since Ling Ling met the female zombie, she had become cheerful, and her smile was seen more often. That change made Wu Chengyue very happy, even though she hadn’t yet started talking.</p> <p>Also, he was quite curious about the female zombie. She always took care of his Ling Ling, and saved her life for a few times. Judging by what was happening now, Meng Yue was right.</p> <p>He needed to devote his life to her to thank her for what she had done.</p> <p>Last time, he bit her thigh; and this time, they had sex. He wondered how she would react when she woke up.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue reached out a hand to raise Lin Qiao’s chin, then carefully observed her face. The more he looked at her, the more familiar he felt, as if he had seen her somewhere.</p> <p>Earlier on, when he first time saw her with cosmetic contacts, he found her familiar in some way without seeing her zombie eyes. He just couldn’t tell why.</p> <p>After spending a while observing her delicate face, Wu Chengyue dropped his hand and said to Wu Yueling, “Since you like her so much, Daddy will marry her, alright? Daddy has already eaten her, so Daddy needs to be responsible for her in the future.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t understand what Wu Chengyue meant by ‘eaten’. Neither did she fully understand the world ‘marry’, but she vaguely understood that that was a good thing.</p> <p>So, she immediately nodded at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>At that moment, Viney swayed her vines and said, <em>‘And me, and me! You need to be responsible for me as well! You’re my Daddy from now on. I’m gonna be Ling Ling’s little sister.’</em></p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at her with a meaningful expression, saying, “Then you should let me see you, the real you. I don’t even know what you are… How am I supposed to be responsible for you? Besides, you dragged me in here, so shouldn’t you be responsible for me?”</p> <p>Viney was puzzled by his question, <em>‘Eh? That seems to be right… Um… um… I’m going to become your little baby in a while anyway… By then, you’ll still have to be responsible for me!’</em></p> <p>Hearing her slick tone of speaking, Wu Chengyue was a little speechless. But still, he managed to grasp a keyword. “You said that you’re going to become a baby, right? You ‘re… You’re not in her belly right now, are you?”</p> <p>While speaking, Wu Chengyue suddenly fixed his eyes on Lin Qiao’s lower belly.</p> <p>Viney responded excitedly, <em>‘Almost, I’m almost there… Only a half of me is in there now. There’s another half.’</em></p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>Strange things happened every year after the end of the old world, but this year, there were so many!</p> <p>Some zombies didn’t eat people, but saved people; some zombies became pretty; some zombies were able to talk and build bases, and… give birth to babies!</p> <p>The last one still needed to be verified though.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue noticed that since he met this female zombie, the zombies around her had all been changing, becoming different. They weren’t the same as ordinary zombies, but had humanity and memories.</p> <p>Those zombies didn’t turn into monsters like Yang Chao did, but had been turning back into human beings.</p> <p>At that point, Viney said, <em>‘I’m going to send you out. After that, I need to continue upgrading Mama’s energy, so that Mama can give birth to the little baby.’</em></p> <p>While speaking, she held the hands of Wu Chengyue and Wu Yueling, and sent them out of the base.</p> <p>The people who had waited in the living room for a whole night didn’t manage to react immediately upon seeing Wu Chengyue abruptly show up, wearing different clothes and carrying Wu Yueling in his arms.</p>",
  "Chapter 377: The Memory About Self-Exploding": "<p>“Chief Wu, you came out! Are you… okay?” Lin Wenwen reacted first as she looked at Wu Chengyue and asked delightedly. However, those different clothes that he was wearing now seemed to have proven that something had happened.</p> <p>“Chengyue!” Meng Yue walked to him gladly.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing smiled calmly, “Were you in Miss. Lu’s space? If you didn’t show up soon, these two ladies were going to tear this place down.” While speaking, he gave Meng Yue and Moli a meaningful glance.</p> <p>“We were just worrying about Chief,” Moli said expressionlessly.</p> <p>“I understand,” Yuan Tianxing smiled and nodded.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue carried Wu Yueling and showed his usual faint smile to the others while responding, “I’m fine, but I’m not sure if Miss. Lu is as well.”</p> <p>He had eaten her, so she might not be okay!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue still couldn’t believe what Viney said. If that vine plant truly became a baby after he and Miss. Lu had sexual intercourse… that would be something huge!</p> <p>Meng Yue looked at his clothes and said, “Chengyue, your clothes…”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue kept that faint smile while responding to her, “Ah, I fell into the lake. My clothes were wet, so I found some clothes in her space and got changed.”</p> <p>Meng Yue didn’t detect his dishonesty and just nodded. Unlike her, Yuan Tianxing gave Wu Chengyue a meaningful glance. As a man, he sensitively felt that he was definitely lying.</p> <p>“Alright, we should be leaving. We were here to pick up Ling Ling, but it somehow took so long. We’ll show ourselves out,” said the smiling Wu Chengyue. After that, he scooped Ling Ling up and walked toward the door, seeming not to have received Yuan Tianxing’s glance.</p> <p>“See you,” Yuan Tianxing and the others smiled at him and walked the three of them to the door.</p> <p>After Wei Jingchen closed the door, Yuan Tianxing laughed in a meaningful way and said, “Do you all think nothing happened between Chief Wu and Miss. Lu?”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing and Long Qingying looked at him confusedly. “What could possibly happen between them?” asked Du Yuanxing, “But, why was he there for so long? Why didn’t Miss. Lu come out?”</p> <p>Only Lin Wenwen seemed to have guessed something out as she said uncertainly, “Why did Chief Wu change his clothes?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing glanced at her, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>…</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao was walking in darkness.</p> <p>She didn’t know where she was, neither did she understand why she kept walking. She had no idea when she would stop or where she was going either.</p> <p>While walking, she suddenly saw a light at the front. She quickened her steps, then saw a scene from the source of the light.</p> <p>The source of the light was like a round-shaped screen.</p> <p>She saw herself, wearing a black army suit, with a raging black fire blazing behind her. She sensed something familiar from that fire, as if it was supposed to be around her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that that was netherworld fire which had been mentioned by Du Yuanxing and the others many times. She knew that the woman in a long, black army coat was herself, because she looked exactly the same as her.</p> <p>The Lin Qiao in a black coat looked cold and fierce, her eyes glowing with a light of madness.</p> <p>Behind her was a cliff, and in front of her were five men. Lin Qiao sensed the strong energies belonging to the five men. None of them was at a level lower than Wu Chengyue and Yang Chao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw that along with the five men, the one in the middle—who was pretty and feminine-looking—was saying something to her other self. The Lin Qiao on the cliff responded to him with only a few words, and after that, the man seemed to be enraged. He said some other words to her, and then her face turned grim.</p> <p>Then, Lin Qiao saw her other self burst out into crazy laughter. Her hair danced in the air without being blown by any wind. With the dark, raging fire behind her, she looked like a demoness.</p> <p>Her long army coat fluttered in the air; her pair of beautiful long legs were wrapped in the trousers and high-heeled boots. She steadily stood at the edge of the cliff and laughed wildly.</p> <p>The Lin Qiao in the darkness noticed that the black fire behind her had started shrinking quickly.</p> <p>The five men had their expressions changed suddenly when they saw the fire shrink, then hurriedly stepped back. But right at that moment, the demoness-like Lin Qiao suddenly exploded.</p> <p>The black fire blew up, covering the whole area about a mile in radius within a moment. Lin Qiao felt that the world before her eyes suddenly turned dark, and then all the images faded.</p> <p>She guessed that those images were from her memory. However, she didn’t understand why she felt that all of those had never happened to her. Had a part of her been missing?</p> <p>That black fire was very similar to her black mist, as they were both purely dark.</p> <p>She believed that she should still go to that cliff and take a look at that place, as soon as possible.</p> <p>The confused Lin Qiao decided to head to the South to find that place as soon as the construction work of the new base was started and stabled. She had a feeling that her seeing those images now definitely meant something.</p> <p>Perhaps, she was able to restore her lost memory of the past five years!</p> <p>Thinking that, she started heading back. She didn’t know why, but she felt that she should be heading back by now.</p> <p>At that moment in her space, Viney’s vines descended from the air, lifted the blanket, and then coiled around Lin Qiao’s stomach, waist, knees. They raised her and brought her toward the lake.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s body was soaked in the water, being wrapped into a jade-white cocoon again by the vines from the water. This time, Viney didn’t only wrap Lin Qiao up with a few vines. Instead, countless vines reached to her, slowly wrapping her into an enormous sphere of vines.</p> <p>The sphere of vine nearly filled up the entire lake.</p> <p>Since Viney’s vines fell from the sky, Shen Yujen in the small space and the zombie dog in the woods had both been staying perfectly quiet, without daring to move at all.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the outside, Yuan Tianxing and the others were discussing when to leave for the new base.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen unwittingly glanced at the ceiling, then said, “But, Miss. Lu hasn’t come out yet. Aren’t we going to wait for her?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing thought for a moment, then replied, “I think we don’t need to. She’ll go there and find us if she doesn’t see us here when she comes out. We don’t know how long she’ll stay in the space, so we might as well go there first. We should start the construction and build the base as soon as we can.”</p> <p>“Should we keep recruiting in here?” Du Yuanxing asked.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “Sure, why not? Otherwise, it’ll take forever for the hundreds of people that we have now to build up the base.”</p>",
  "Chapter 378: Make this Clear": "<p>Du Yuanxing murmured, “We have around four-hundred people now. I think that’s already a lot… We’re only going to build a fence wall. That doesn’t need too many people, does it?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing smiled faintly as he gave him a glance and said, “Don’t we need to clean up the buildings inside the fence wall? Don’t we need to tidy those rooms? Don’t we have to clear the roads?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Du Yuanxing immediately turned a little upset as he realized that a huge clean-up work was needed to be done. “Ugh… You’re right! We also need to clear the road and clean the buildings for people to live in. Wow, there are so many abandoned cars on those roads. If only those zombies could remove the trash for us.”</p> <p>“That’s a good idea,” said Long Qingying, “But, you have to ask Miss. Lu or Qiu Lili for help.”</p> <p>Hearing her say that he’d have to talk to Lin Qiao or Qiu Lili, who was also a terrifying zombie, Du Yuanxing quickly shook his head and said, “No, no, I think we can clean the road by ourselves real quick.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen rolled her eyes and said, “At least you don’t need to worry that some zombies might jump on you while you’re working. Don’t be ungrateful!”</p> <p>The others all nodded; she was right. Before, when building a base, half of the people needed to guard the construction site to prevent sudden zombie attacks so that the other half could focus on working.</p> <p>At that time, everyone had different feelings from what they had now. Most of the people were scared, despairing, panicked, and helpless.</p> <p>By now, all the survivors had gotten used to the environment after the apocalypse, and were even familiar with zombies. It had been five years. Anyhow, they should have adapted already.</p> <p>“Du, you stay here to continue the recruitment. I’ll leave Junjie and Wenxing here to help you,” Yuan Tianxing made the decision, “The rest of us will stay for another day. If Miss. Lu doesn’t show up tomorrow, we’ll leave at four in the afternoon. We should be able to arrive there by six.”</p> <p>The others all nodded in agreement.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the other side, Wu Chengyue went back to the base center, wearing a sports suit. Wu Yueling was carried in his arms. He didn’t say anything on the way back, only maintaining that faint smile on the corners of his mouth. However, Meng Yue, who had been paying attention to him, found that he was absent-minded the whole time.</p> <p>“Chengyue, you spent there an entire night. Are you really fine?” Meng Yue asked while following him home.</p> <p>Moli also lived in the base center. Wu Chengyue had accommodated her in a nearby building, and sent two level-five superpowered people to be her bodyguard. She had a great reaction capacity, and was able to protect herself to a certain degree. So, as long as she didn’t encounter level six or seven enemies, she would be safe.</p> <p>Hearing Meng Yue’s question, Wu Chengyue walked to a couch and put Wu Yueling down.</p> <p>He made his daughter sit on the couch, then raised his head to say to Meng Yue, “Something did happen… But, I’m afraid that you might not be able to accept it if I told you. Yue, in the past five years, I’ve been seeing you as a good friend or my little sister. I think you know that.”</p> <p>He then erased that smile on his face and said to Meng Yue seriously, “Sit down, let’s talk.”</p> <p>Looking at his face and hearing his words, Meng Yue suddenly had a very bad feeling. She even had an impulse to turn and leave. However, she still obediently sat on another couch and looked on at Wu Chengyue, waiting for him to continue.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue thought for a moment, then said to her, “You’ve been working for me all these years. You’re very capable, and I like capable people. In front of the others, we are leader and subordinate, and at home, we are friends. I’ve been taking care of you because you’re like my little sister. I wish that you can find a good man to spend the rest of your life with.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Meng Yue panicked. “Chengyue, please stop…” she said abruptly.</p> <p>However, Wu Chengyue didn’t plan to stop. Instead, he continued, “I don’t know when you suddenly fell in love with me. That’s not your fault. It’s my fault, because I can’t respond to the special feeling of yours, just like you can’t respond to what Yunlong has toward you. I believe you can understand me.”</p> <p>He believed so, because they were in about the same situation.</p> <p>Meng Yue had always been a composed woman. But at that moment, she abruptly stood up and stuttered, “Chenyue, I haven’t made the dinner… I’m going to make the dinner…”</p> <p>“Sit down… let me finish,” said Wu Chengyue.”</p> <p>“No, I don’t want to hear it!” Meng Yue shook her head as she looked at him and said.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue sighed, “Sit down. I need to say this to you, sooner or later… Please!”</p> <p>Meng Yue stared at him and paused for a moment, then slowly sat down. Her face was wearing a bitter look, and her brain was occupied by disordered thoughts.</p> <p>Why did he suddenly say those words to her? He never gave her any chance, and had been keeping a distance from her, intentionally or not. To avoid awkward situations, the two of them and Xiao Yunlong had been living here together.</p> <p>However, she never thought about giving up. She believed that one day, Wu Chengyue would realize how much she loved him, and slowly accept her.</p> <p>But now, he was making it clear. He was saying all those words to reject her.</p> <p>Meng Yue couldn’t accept it. She didn’t want to hear Wu Chengyue reject her. She didn’t want to hear it! Nevertheless, she didn’t dare to disobey him, because she was worried that he might dislike her because of that.</p> <p>Seeing the look on her face, Wu Chengyue sighed silently. He had to tell her how he had been feeling, because if he didn’t, she would have more and more hopes, and things would become complicated.</p> <p>He rubbed Wu Yueling’s hair, then said, “Like you said last time, I should find Ling Ling a mother. I have already started to think about that. You’re not a little girl anymore. Don’t waste all your time on me. If you really don’t want to accept Yunlong, think about the others.”</p> <p>Meng Yue popped her eyes to gaze at him. When she heard what he said, she couldn’t help but choke up, with her eyes turned red. The sadness suddenly rose from her heart, making her want to burst into tears.</p> <p>Once again, she abruptly stood up. This time, she didn’t say anything but turned and ran upstairs, rushing into her room.</p> <p>Looking at her back, Wu Chengyue sighed again. “Daddy made Aunty Yue cry,” he said to Wu Yueling, “What should I do? We have nothing to eat for dinner.”</p> <p>After the apocalypse, everyone thought that he was married, because he had Ling Ling. But in fact, he had never married. Even before the old world ended, he was still single.</p> <p>He was a good-looking base leader, so without question, a lot of women fancied him. However, as a picky man, he wouldn’t even touch the women that he didn’t like.</p> <p>Therefore, he had been fulfilling his sexual needs with his own hand.</p>",
  "Chapter 379: Start Background-digging": "<p>After the apocalypse, Wu Chengyue raised Ling Ling in the drastically changed world. Some people followed him, and they build a base together. Only after that did they finally have a home.</p> <p>After becoming Ling Ling’s daddy, he devoted his off-work time to try and be a good father. At work, he was all about how to be a good leader and how to run the base, providing a safe and comfortable place to live for all the survivors.</p> <p>In the zombie-free base, people had food, clean water, and places to live. All these needed him and the other two leaders to spend efforts on.</p> <p>As more and more people joined his base, more problems occurred, and he became busier and busier. So, he had no spare time and energy to think about starting a relationship.</p> <p>It was already a little late when he discovered what Meng Yue had toward him. She was a girl, and a friend who had been staying around him the whole time. So, he surely could not send her away. With no other choice, he had been intentionally keeping a distance from her, hoping that she would give up.</p> <p>But later on, he found that she was a persistent woman!</p> <p>He planned to distance himself from her gradually, and also had created plenty of opportunities for Xiao Yunlong, as he wished the latter could earn her favor as soon as possible. However, his plan didn’t work.</p> <p>In that aspect, Xiao Yunlong wasn’t a capable teammate!</p> <p>If that female zombi’s pet vine didn’t entrap both of them, he wouldn’t make it clear to Meng Yue so straightforwardly. After all, he understood how awfully his words would hurt Meng Yue.</p> <p>However, he had decided to be with that female zombie. To avoid misunderstanding and troubles, he had to make himself clear to Meng Yue. Otherwise, the stubborn Meng Yue might do something irrational after she found out about him and the female zombie. He just couldn’t tell how she would react.</p> <p>After hearing what he said, Wu Yueling confusedly glanced at the stairs, then turned back to gaze at her father with a pair of sparkling eyes which were filled with puzzles.</p> <p>“Ling Ling, you sit here. Daddy will make dinner. Is that okay? Are you hungry?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling nodded, then quietly sat on the couch.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stood up and walked toward the kitchen, thinking that there was no other choice than leaving Meng Yue alone for a while. Maybe she would think it through.</p> <p>Also, he decided to send out some people to do some detailed background checking about that female zombie. He didn’t even know her full name yet. People called her Miss. Lu now, and last time, she introduced herself as Lin. What Lin?</p> <p>And her face… For some reasons, the more he thought about her face, the more familiar he felt. He believed that he had seen her somewhere before, but just couldn’t remember where.</p> <p>There was one other problem… That female zombie seemed not yet to know that he was the one who had eaten her yesterday. He wondered how she would react when she found out.</p> <p>With those thoughts, Wu Chengyue suddenly felt better. The depression caused by Meng Yue earlier on was now eased, and that made him feel relieved.</p> <p>While he was making food, Yuan Tianxing and the others had started dinner. In the space, Lin Qiao was unconscious, wrapped in the enormous vine sphere. No one knew that the gigantic vine sphere had been disappearing bit by bit.</p> <p>That was right, it was disappearing!</p> <p>Meanwhile, a stream of vibe had been slowly seeping into Lin Qiao’s uterus.</p> <p>That was Viney’s vibe.</p> <p>Except for what was happening in the water, nothing in the space changed.</p> <p>…</p> <p>That night, Wu Chengyue called Xiao Licheng to his study room and gave him a mission. The mission was to dig out the female zombie’s background in detail.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng accepted the mission and then left with confusion. He didn’t understand why his Chief had sent him to do background digging about that female zombie.</p> <p>Once Xiao Licheng accepted the mission, Kong Qingming received a message about that. Next day, at noontime, he went to Lu Tianyi’s office.</p> <p>“Chief Wu hasn’t found out that your zombie sister is the one who raped him, has he?” he said to Lu Tianyi once he walked in. The latter was reading the reports about the monthly harvests of the crops. Hearing Kong Qingming’s words, he raised his head and asked with confusion, “Who are you talking about?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming walked to the couch and took a seat, then crossed his arms before his chest and explained lazily, “Miss. Lu… Chief Wu has sent his people to dig her background. So, I’m thinking maybe he is suspecting her. Otherwise, why didn’t he do the background-digging earlier? Why did he suddenly order his people to do it now?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi wore a serious look as well. If Kong Qingming was right, he would have to prevent Chief Wu from knowing the truth!</p> <p>Kong Qingming seemed to understand his concern. “Don’t worry, I have secretly hidden the information,” he said blandly, “I also discovered that those Hades Base people have also been concealing that thing. Therefore, I guess Chief Wu won’t be able to find out about Miss. Lu’s true identity so soon.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi sighed in relief and slightly relaxed his tightened handsome face. “Thank you!”</p> <p>Kong Qingming glanced at him and said, “Why thank me? Miss. Lu saved our lives. We all owe her. It’s just… Why is she so different from before after she became a zombie?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi leaned against the back of the chair as he rubbed his chin and said, “Maybe she was stimulated too badly when she died, so after turning into a zombie, she decided to amend his way and um… live a new life?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming found his words amusing. “She’s your sister, so you know her better than anyone else. Do you think that’s possible?” he asked, “If she wanted to amend her ways, she would have done it long ago.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi looked at him with discontentment and said, “Why not? People always regret or wake up in the most difficult time of their lives. Why can’t I believe that she has woken up?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming looked at him helplessly. “Alright, alright, I knew you’d think that way. Perhaps you’re right. Judging by Miss. Lu’s current behavior, she has probably woken up as you said. But, why do I feel that you like your sister more and more?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi crossed his arms before his chest and said, “I’ve been protecting her forever. Have you just realized that?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming didn’t know what to say. He felt that if they kept talking about his sister, the conversation would never end. However, Lu Tianyi soon asked him a question that made the latter unable to sit still, “The other night, you were knocking on Lin Wenwen’s door, but why did you suddenly drag me over? You acted weird that time, why?”</p>",
  "Chapter 380: Let Me Laugh": "<p>However, Lu Tianyi soon asked Kong Qingming a question that made the latter unable to sit still, “The other night, you were knocking on Lin Wenwen’s door, but why did you suddenly drag me over? You acted weird that time, why?”</p> <p>The expression on Kong Qingming’s handsome froze for a moment, and his narrow eyes were a little unfocused. He remembered that cold face he saw that day. Her face wasn’t delicate, but those sharp eyes impressed him deeply. He could even still feel those dagger-like eyes.</p> <p>“Um… I just felt that the look which the woman with a ponytail had in her eyes was a little scary! I couldn’t handle her, so I automatically dragged you there. In fact, I don’t know why either.”</p> <p>Seeing the confused look in his face and hearing his answer, Lu Tianyi had his eye glowing. Abruptly, he uncrossed his arms and stood up, staring at Kong Qingming with great interests. Soon, he walked out from behind the desk to before Kong Qingming, and bent over to gaze at his face closely. “Qingming, have you realized that your face is a little… burning right now?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming was puzzled at first, then automatically raised his hand to touch his face. Seeing that, Lu Tianyi burst in laughter. “Hahahahaha…”</p> <p>He laughed loudly and happily, without saying anything.</p> <p>Kong Qingming looked at him bewilderedly. As Lu Tianyi wouldn’t stop laughing, he began losing patience. “If you have something to say, just say it. Why’re you laughing like a ghost.”</p> <p>While keeping laughing, Lu Tianyi covered his forehead with a hand and waved a hand at the other. Then, he walked back to his seat and sat back down.</p> <p>“Hahaha… Just let me laugh. I can’t hold it back anymore!”</p> <p>Hearing his laughter, Kong Qingming’s face turned even darker. He glared at Lu Tianyi and said, “Make it clear to me!”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lu Tianyi finally stopped laughing loudly. He looked at Kong Qingming and asked, “How’ bout this, you answer me a few questions first. That day, after you saw her dagger-like eyes, did your heart flip?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming was recalling that ordinary and clean-looking face which he saw that day. Still, his attention was attracted by that pair of eyes of hers. To respond to the other’s words, he nodded.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi continued, “So at that time, were you subconsciously panicking? Did your body react before your brain and make you want to escape?”</p> <p>Back then, Kong Qingming’s reaction was indeed unwitting, as his brain wasn’t even working. So, he nodded again.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi laughed again. He put both hands on the desk, then rested his head on those hands.</p> <p>“Hehehehehe…”</p> <p>Kong Qingming felt extremely uncomfortable upon hearing his laughter. He couldn’t help but complain, “Can you please stop laughing? Can’t you just talk straight?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lu Tianyi raised his head and looked at Kong Qingming with a big grin, “Qingming, you’re quite capable, but why are you so slow-minded about these things?”</p> <p>“These things? What things?” Kong Qingming looked at him, his head full of puzzles.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi gave him a few glances, then shook his head and responded, “Alright. I think you need to figure it out by yourself, so it’ll be meaningful. I won’t tell you. But, do remember one thing, that you just need to follow your feelings.”</p> <p>Kong Qingming felt so annoyed. Saying something like that was the same as saying nothing, wasn’t it?</p> <p>“What on earth are you talking about? Why can’t I understand a word you said?” he asked.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi shook his head, didn’t say another word. After that, no matter how many questions Kong Qingming asked, he only smiled at him. At last, the latter left with anger.</p> <p>While leaving, that woman’s cold face had been showing up in his mind. He wondered if it was because they had been talking about her the whole time.</p> <p>Her appearance was ordinary, but she was clean-looking. Also, her vibe was strong, and it seemed like she was keeping a good distance from everyone else.</p> <p>Her body shape was not bad though!</p> <p>…</p> <p>That day in the afternoon, Yuan Tianxing, Lin Wenwen, Long Qingying, Lu Junjie and the others left Sea City Base for Upper City District in Hangzhou.</p> <p>In Lin Qiao’s space, the vine sphere which she was wrapped in had still been disappearing slowly. It was way too huge, so during the past twenty-four hours, not even one percent of it had vanished.</p> <p>Lin Feng, Chen Yuting and their people first cleaned the hotel, sorting and counting the furniture pieces which were still useful. The broken ones or awfully blood-stained ones were moved out, then torn in pieces or burned. Meanwhile, Mrs. Lin and the other female members helped clean the quilts, blankets, sheets, and other things.</p> <p>These works couldn’t be finished in days. Lin Feng and his people were patient enough, as this was just a beginning. The base needed to be built up step by step.</p> <p>Qiu Lili and Mengmeng stayed on the roof, quietly watching those people clean the place without lending a helping hand. On the other side Lin Hao and his people began sweeping through the surrounding area to search for food and supplies.</p> <p>After a busy day, they heard a vehicle driving over in the evening. Without question, the people in that vehicle were friends, or the car wouldn’t be able to pass the zombie wall.</p> <p>Hearing the noise of the car, Lin Feng first thought of Yuan Tianxing and the others, “I think Tianxing and the others are back.”</p> <p>Hearing him, the others all stopped working and turned to the broad road before the hotel.</p> <p>Lin Feng made eye-contact with Chen Yuting, then glanced at his watch and said, “It’s about dinner time. Tell everybody to get off work for dinner.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting nodded in response.</p> <p>An SUV stopped before the hotel. Long Qingying, who liked to sit on car roofs, jumped off the first. After that, the car doors were opened, and Yuan Tianxing, Lin Wenwen, and a few others got out.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Feng and the others standing before the hotel, they sighed in relief.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin held Lin Xiaolu’s hand and gave a few more glances at the vehicle before saying to Lin Wenwen, who was meters away from her, “Wenwen, why did you cut your hair? What happened?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen touched the hair by her ear, then gave a natural smile and said, “Nothing. I just feel that long hair can be inconvenient. So, I cut them.”</p> <p>Both Mrs. Lin and Cheng Wangxue looked at her with surprise. “How can that be possible? You cut your hair because you felt it was inconvenient? I don’t believe it! What on earth has happened? Tell me!” said Mrs. Lin.</p> <p>“Mom, I want to change myself,” Lin Wenwen had no other choice but explained, “Didn’t you all say that I was too self-willed? I’ll change it. To make up my mind, I cut my hair. What’s wrong about that?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin looked at her with disbelief, saying, “How many times have we said that? You never cared much. How come you suddenly want to change yourself?”</p> <p>“Yeah!” Cheng Wangxue nodded.</p> <p>“Ugh, just believe what I said,” Lin Wenwen responded helplessly, “I’ve already cut it, and I don’t regret. Is it because my hair are so ugly that you can’t get used to it yet?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin and Cheng Wangxue both nodded. “They are a little ugly indeed. I do feel strange about it, as you mentioned it,” said Mrs. Lin. Meanwhile, Lin Feng and the others all nodded in agreement.</p> <p>Looking at her roughly cut, terribly styled short hair, and thinking about how long and shiny they used to be, those people did feel odd. However, Mrs. Lin soon changed the topic. “Didn’t Miss. Lu come with you? And Yuanxing…” she said to Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen answered her question, “Ah, Miss. Lu hasn’t come over yet. Yuanxing stayed in Sea City Base to continue the recruitment work. We still need more people.”</p>",
  "Chapter 381: Yuan Tianxing in Position": "<p>The recruitment ads that they released recently were divided into two different types, one for workers who were willing to come here to do a job, and one for the residents of this new base. The people who wanted to change their environment were welcome to join the new base.</p> <p>Except for the ones who harbored evil intentions, or people like post-apocalyptic robbers, the new base would accept almost all sorts of applicants. And of course, the ones who chose to join the new base would be paid well.</p> <p>The new residents of the base would be put in the positions which fit their contributions to the base.</p> <p>That was a common rule in all bases.</p> <p>“Did anything happen to Miss. Lu?” Mrs. Lin asked with concern.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen smiled and responded, “She should be fine. Ugh, I want to tell you about what happened in Sea City Base yesterday.”</p> <p>Hearing that, the others immediately turned to her with curiosity. Only Mrs. Lin showed a trace of worry on her face. However, she didn’t ask any further question, but walked into the lobby with the others.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing said to Chen Yuting and Lin Feng, “Yesterday in Sea City Base, Yang Chao and his people were destroyed by Chief Wu and Chief Zou. Yang Chao died.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting and the others who had just walked into the lobby all froze when they heard that, gazing at Yuan Tianxing in disbelief.</p> <p>“What? He died? How did that happen so suddenly? Our Chief wasn’t ready to take action, was he?” Chen Yuting asked with surprise.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing responded while walking straight to the few clean couches in the lobby, “In fact, something happened the day you guys left. Because of that, Chief Wu quickly launched a counter strike. All that happened was also the result of some troublemaker’s deeds.”</p> <p>While speaking, he laughed with a complicated expression.</p> <p>Chen Yuting and the others curiously surrounded him. “Tell us what exactly happened there!”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing said, “That night, one of Yang Chao’s Deputy Chief died. The man named Piao Gecang was bitten by a zombie that came from nowhere. After that, he went to the research institute of Sea City Base for some reason, and started a fight against some people in the research institute. At last, some other guy killed him. One researcher died as well.”</p> <p>Hearing Piao Gecang’s name, Chen Yuting paused for a second. But soon, he stared at Yuan Tianxing in shock and said, “What did you say? Piao Gecang died?”</p> <p>That man had given him a hard time not long ago. At that time, Chen Yuting didn’t know that the latter was the man who caused his Jen’s death yet. He was only surprised because that man who had troubled him not long ago was suddenly dead.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing said, “Yeah! More than two people died that night. Yang Chao’s sister, Yang Yan also died.”</p> <p>“Eh? Wasn’t she who encouraged her son to harass Wenwen? She died as well? Who killed her?” Lin Feng asked.</p> <p>The others quickly glanced at Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing also gave Lin Wenwen a glance when answering the question, “Miss. Lu said that she did it. But, I heard that Yang Yuan’s head and arm were bitten off by some kind of beast, and that she died very miserably! None of her people saw how she died.”</p> <p>Lin Feng and the others glanced at each other in shock. “Miss. Lu? How come she’s involved in it too?”</p> <p>“We’re not sure,” said Yuan Tianxing, “But that’s what she said. She also found that a level-seven superpowered man on Yang Chao’s side had been hiding in Sea City Base. Next day at the meeting of all the senior base administrators, they started the war. What caused the war was that Yang Chao had run some kind of virus experiment with hundreds of people from Sea City Base, and gotten them all killed. Some of his subordinates were infected as well. At last, they all became half-zombie, half-human monsters, and ended up being killed.”</p> <p>“Are you saying that he ran experiments on live human beings? My God!” Mrs. Lin exclaimed.</p> <p>After the apocalypse, the world had become sparsely populated. However, Yang Chao actually ran experiments on healthy people. That was truly insane! Also, judging by Yuan Tianxing’s words, those people didn’t volunteer, but were all forced.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and continued, “Yang Chao thought no one knew about his secret experiment. However, Chief had collected all the information about it since long ago. So on that day, he uncovered it and joined hands with the other leader of Sea City Base to banish Yang Chao.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting wore an angry face. Hearing Yuan Tianxing say that Yang Chao was only banished, he asked with discontentment, “Why did they only banish him? His kind of people should be destroyed!”</p> <p>His Jen was also injected with the zombie virus, and now, he learned that Yang Chao and his people had been hurting more innocent people in that way.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing shook his head and explained, “They banished him, so he wasn’t a base leader anymore. That was only the first step. The second step was the key… He was executed for murdering hundreds of people. That was an explanation to the people in the base.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting calmed down slightly after hearing that. “You’re right…”</p> <p>“Captain Chen, you don’t need to be angry,” said Lin Feng, “As Tianxing said, Yang Chao has died. All the people who deserved death are already dead.”</p> <p>After comforting Chen Yuting, Lin Feng continued, “And then? What happened at last?”</p> <p>“At last, Yang Chao became a monster,” said Yuan Tianxing, “Chief Wu and a few others killed him joint-handedly. But, I heard that the man who was there to help him ran away upon realizing that the situation was unfavorable.”</p> <p>“Eh? He ran away? Yang Chao must be so angry about it,” said Mrs. Lin with surprise.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing smilingly nodded and said, “Perhaps. We weren’t on the scene, so we don’t know how he reacted.”</p> <p>The others glanced at each other. Picturing what happened at that time, they all wanted to laugh.</p> <p>“Where did he find such an unreliable help? Who is that man?” Mrs. Lin laughed at first, then asked.</p> <p>“Miss. Lu said that he’s a post-apocalyptic robber,” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“Post-apocalyptic robber? Yang Chao was really insane. He not only turned himself into a monster, but also ganged up with a robber from the outside. He could really do anything,” Mrs. Lin sighed.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing suddenly thought of something. “Speaking of that post-apocalyptic robber,” he said with a serious face, “we need to be careful. Miss. Lu said that he had watched us for a whole night. His target should be Wenwen. Now, Yang Chao has died, and he has escaped. But still, he’s a robber. We can’t tell for sure if he’ll keep following us.”</p> <p>Hearing that a level-seven post-apocalyptic robber might be targeting them, all Lin Family people turned vigilant.</p> <p>“That’s possible! Post-apocalyptic robbers are all vengeful. They’ll do whatever they can to get whatever they want. We’ll be in serious troubles if he has his eyes on us!” Lin Feng wore a grim look as well.</p>",
  "Chapter 382: Viney Entrapped Her Daddy": "<p>“Why are you afraid? If he dares to show up, I’ll make him die in this place.” A silvery voice was heard suddenly. The people turned around and saw two little girls walking downstairs; one of them was pretty, and the other ugly.</p> <p>Qiu Lili swayed her long, black, and shiny twin tails. Following behind her was a scale-faced girl, and behind her was Liu Jun, with Tongtong carried in her arms.</p> <p>All the others found a strong contrast between Qiu Lili and the scale-faced girl zombie.</p> <p>Liu Jun looked at Lin Wenwen’s short hair and asked curiously, “Eh? Wenwen, what happened to your hair?”</p> <p>“Ah, nothing! I cut them myself.” Lin Wenwen smiled at her.</p> <p>Liu Jun spent a few seconds staring at her hair, then couldn’t help but say, “What a pity! Your long hair were stunning.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen only smiled, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>“Your hair need some extra work,” Liu Jun continued, “Do you need my help?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen’s eyes glowed. “Can you do that?” she asked.</p> <p>Liu Jun smiled and nodded, saying, “I used to be a stylist. After the apocalypse, people don’t care about style anymore, so I lost my job.”</p> <p>Cheng Wangxue looked at her with surprise and said knowingly, “I see! No wonder I found your hairstyle always perfect for you, even when you made nothing more than a casual ponytail.”</p> <p>Liu Jun gave a faint smile and said, “I haven’t practiced for years, but I think I’m still able to fix Wenwen’s hair.”</p> <p>“I think you decided to help her because you can’t bear watching her hair. Her hair have been bothering me for a long time too!” Long Qingying abruptly joined the conversation.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen gave her a threatening glance and said, “Didn’t you help cut my hair? How can you say that?”</p> <p>Long Qingying shrugged as she responded expressionlessly, “I don’t know how to cut hair, but you made me do it. Is that my fault?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen didn’t know what else to say.</p> <p>“When will… Miss. Lu come back?” asked Chen Yuting uneasily.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing looked at him and answered, “We’re not sure about her plan. But, she’ll definitely come back sometime.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili stood beside them as she crossed her arms and said, “I think Qiaoqiao is going to upgrade Viney. Maybe she’ll be back in a few days. Since you’ve all arrived, we can officially start the construction work tomorrow, right?”</p> <p>Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing both nodded. “Tomorrow morning, we’ll have a meeting in this place to talk about where to start from,” said Yuan Tianxing, and the others nodded. The ladies didn’t say anything, as there would be no work for them to do tomorrow.</p> <p>“Alright, I think dinner is almost ready. Let’s head to the restaurant.” Lin Feng patted his own knees and stood up. While speaking, he walked to Mrs. Lin and picked up Lin Xiaolu’s hand before heading toward the restaurant.</p> <p>The others all stood up and followed him to the restaurant.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In the Sea City Base, Wu Chengyue hadn’t seen Meng Yue for an entire day. He didn’t know if she was in her room or had gone out. Perhaps, she was just avoiding him intentionally.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue understood how she had been feeling now. It was inappropriate for him to talk too much to her about her feelings, so he didn’t pay much attention to that, but finished breakfast and left home with Wu Yueling to work.</p> <p>At noon, Xiao Licheng returned to the office and reported to him with a pretty weird expression, “Chief, the information about Miss. Lu has been concealed. I couldn’t find anything about her.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was puzzled at first, then put down the files in his hands and raised his head to look at Xiao Licheng as he asked him, “Concealed? By whom?”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng shook his head and responded, “I’m not sure. I’ve talked to those Hades Base people, but they refuse to tell me anything. I think they’re hiding Miss. Lu’s true identity on purpose. Chief, why do you suddenly want to dig out her background?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue slightly dropped his eyelids while thinking and murmuring, “Why are Yuan Tianxing and his people hiding the information about her?”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng shook his head and said, “That… I don’t know. Should I keep digging?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and said, “Sure, why not? The harder they’re trying to conceal it, the more we want to know. That’s how things become interesting!”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng nodded and said, “Okay. I’ll try to find a way to make them talk.”</p> <p>“Go ahead,” said Wu Chengyue, “Also, tell Li Yueshan to keep an eye on their new base secretly, and the residential area that Yuan Tianxing stayed at earlier. If you found any trace of Miss. Lu, let me know as soon as possible.”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng looked at him confusedly and asked, “Chief, does Miss. Lu have a problem? Why do you want Yueshan to watch those people?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave him a mysterious smile while responding, “You’ll know why as soon as I have finished my recent works in the base. Another thing, don’t let Meng Yue find out that I’ve told you to do background-digging about Miss. Lu.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng stood before Wu Chengyue’s desk, feeling terribly puzzled. However, as Wu Chengyue didn’t seem to tell him anything, he had no choice but to start doing his job with curiosity.</p> <p>After Xiao Licheng left, Wu Chengyue began wondering why Yuan Tianxing and his people were concealing the information about that female zombie.</p> <p>Her last name was Lu. Who could she be before death? And, why did her face look so familiar?</p> <p>He was also surprised that she had actually been repaired into a virgin after becoming a zombie!</p> <p>Thinking of that, Wu Chengyue had a strange feeling.</p> <p>Even the smile in his eyes grew more obvious along with the strange feeling he had. He didn’t notice that though.</p> <p>She came here with Yuan Tianxing and his people, so she should be a member of the old Hades Base. Wu Chengyue just didn’t understand why her identity was a secret, and why they even concealed all the information about her.</p> <p>How could he not do the background-digging? He was going to marry that female zombie, so he had to know everything about her!</p> <p>He also wondered if that vine plant’s words about it becoming a little baby were real. If that were real, how was it going to do that? Did it really make that female zombie pregnant during their sexual intercourse?</p> <p>He felt so unbelievable about that! If that were real, that vine plant would become the soul of that little baby, wouldn’t it?</p> <p>So… Did that vine create a flesh body for itself with his sperm and her egg?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue lowered his head and looked at his own lower belly with a complicated expression. Was he entrapped by a highly intelligent mutant plant? Did that plant borrow a sperm from him and make himself a baby?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue wore a stunned look as he suddenly figured that out. He popped his eyes in shock while staring straight at his lower belly and feeling astonished.</p> <p>Damn! Did that plant become some kind of spirit after the apocalypse? Where was it from? It actually schemed against his children!</p> <p>Damn! What a world! Last time, he was raped by an evil woman… and this time, he was entrapped by a plant!</p> <p><em>‘Good for you, little Viney! You entrapped your Daddy before you’re even born! Wait until you’re born and see how I’ll punish you!’</em></p> <p><em>‘However, now I need to work it out with your mother first…’</em></p>",
  "Chapter 383: Aren’t You Going?": "<p>While Wu Chengyue was still staring at his belly, the door of his office opened suddenly and Xiao Yunlong broke in, speaking angrily, “What did you say to Yue?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue came back to himself. He raised his head to look at Xiao Yunlong and ignored the latter’s attitude as he asked blandly, “What happened to her?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong glared at him with anger while saying, “Tell me what you said to her first. She’s so haggard now as if she has lost her soul. She didn’t get any sleep last night. And her eyes are puffy, because she has been crying the whole time. She doesn’t even dare to come out today.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stood up and walked out from behind the desk while saying to Xiao Yunlong, “Calm down first.”</p> <p>After that, he walked to the couch that Wu Yueling was sitting on, then pointed at it.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong walked over grumpily and sat down as he asked, “Tell me what has happened. Did you say something to her yesterday when you got back? If you didn’t, how would someone as calm as her become like this?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue responded, “I made it clear with her. I knew that she wouldn’t be able to accept it, but it was about time for me. If I didn’t tell her, it would be too late.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong was puzzled for a second, and the angry look on his face faded a little. “What happened to you? Why did you suddenly tell her about your real feelings?”</p> <p>“Because I’m going to find Ling Ling a mother. I need to make her give up on what she has toward me. Otherwise, she might be unhappy when I bring her back.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong popped his eyes as he stared at Wu Chengyue in shock, saying, “Wha-what did you say? You’re getting married? What about Ling Ling? What if that woman secretly bullied my goddaughter? Who is she?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue found his reaction amusing. “Calm down! It’s me who’s going to get married, not you. Why’re you worrying so much?” he said carelessly, “Do you think I’ll marry a woman who’ll hurt Ling Ling? Am I such an awful and stupid person?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong straightened his upper body and continued staring at Wu Chengyue with confusion while asking, “No, I mean… are you really going to marry someone? Are you serious?”</p> <p>“What has been done cannot be undone. Shouldn’t I continue?” said Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong popped his eyes again to gaze at Wu Chengyue, as if the latter was a ghost, “You were raped last time, and that cannot be undone either. Why didn’t you marry her?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue paused for a second, then stared at him expressionlessly and responded, “Could I possibly marry someone like that? Why don’t you think about what kind of woman she was? If you were raped by an evil woman, would you marry her?”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong immediately lowered his head and replied, “Forget it! I can’t handle a woman like that. So, is that the reason why you made it clear with Yue? Who is she? Where is she from?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue shook his head and said, “You’ll know. I haven’t dug out her background yet.”</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong looked at him from head to toe while saying with a weird look, “I remember that day you went to Yuan Tianxing’s place to pick up Ling Ling… You stayed there for quite a long time, and came home late. So, you were doing that. Only two women lived in that place, Lin Wenwen, and the one with a katana. You didn’t sleep with one of them, did you?”</p> <p>After saying that, he frowned as he found a problem. “Em, we’ve already known about Lin Wenwen’s background, but just now, you said that you haven’t dug out her background yet. Is that the woman with a katana? The one named… Long Qing or something?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue shook his head at him and said, “You’ve been overthinking. It’s not one of them.</p> <p>Hearing that, Xiao Yunlong looked at him, his eyes full of puzzles. “What? Not them? Who is she then? Did you run into a pretty woman and sleep with her in a woods on your way back?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue sighed, then waved a hand at him and responded, “Ugh, just give up! You’re definitely not smart enough to guess that out. Now, I’ve made Yue sad, and it’s awkward for me to see her. So, Ling Ling and I will stay here for the time being. You should take the opportunity to talk to her.”</p> <p>“Me… talk to her? She has been listening to your words only,” Xiao Yunlong replied helplessly after Wu Chengyue told him to talk to Meng Yue. The latter stood up from the couch and said, “Aren’t you going to? Well, I’ll send Licheng then. Licheng, come in!”</p> <p>He abruptly shouted toward the door, then walked to his desk.</p> <p>Xiao Yunlong confusedly heard him talking about letting Xiao Licheng talk to Meng Yue. Was he trying to create opportunities for Xiao Licheng and Meng Yue?</p> <p>Seeing Xiao Licheng open the door and come in, Xiao Yunlong immediately stood up and said, “I will do it. Why are you sending Licheng? He doesn’t know how to talk…” While speaking, he quickly turned and left.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng looked at Wu Chengyue with confusion, then turned to the tall and sturdy Xiao Yunlong who was leaving.</p> <p>After watching Xiao Yunlong leave, Wu Chengyue sat down behind his desk and said to Xiao Licheng, “Ling Ling and I will live here for now. Please go back to pack some of our clothes and bring them here.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” Xiao Licheng nodded and responded.</p> <p>“Go,” Wu Chengyue waved a hand at him.</p> <p>Wu Yueling had been spending time alone, without paying any attention to the conversation between the adults. After Xiao Licheng left, she raised her head, looking at the drawing board in her hand.</p> <p>She put down the pencil and jumped off the couch, then put on her tiny shoes before running to Wu Chengyue with her drawing board.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was going to start reading files, but he put down the files upon noticing Ling Ling’s movements and turned to look at her.</p> <p>He saw her quickly run over, then lean against his legs and hand him the drawing board.</p> <p>“What did Ling Ling draw?” Wu Chengyue affectionately rubbed her head and asked. After that, he turned to look at Wu Yueling’s drawing.</p> <p>The drawings created by children were mostly very abstract. Wu Yueling’s drawing was composed of some rough shapes and simple colors. But still, children’ drawings could provide some information.</p> <p>Wu Yueling drew three people—two adults with a child between them. What her father didn’t understand was why one of the two adults was bald.</p> <p>He pointed at the little person in the middle and asked Wu Yueling, “Ling Ling, is this you?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at him with a pair of sparkling eyes and nodded. Then, Wu Chengyue pointed at the adult with hair and asked, “Who’s this?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling pointed at him and looked at him, without saying anything.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue then pointed at the bald adult and continued, “Who’s this then?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling seemed to be a little struggling now. She pointed at her own head, then rubbed her hands together.</p> <p>She might have felt how unclear it was, so she started to look around. Her father couldn’t figure out what she was looking for. And then, she abruptly put both hands on her chest and drew a pair of arcs.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was stunned, as he realized that his innocent little girl had grown some gender consciousness!</p>",
  "Chapter 384: Outlanders": "<p>Wu Chengyue sent out his people to dig up Lin Qiao’s background, but that never went well. In the meantime, he sent some other people to keep an eye on her new base, but she never showed up.</p> <p>A couple of days later, two strange people suddenly entered the Sea City Base and directly found Wu Chengyue. They had a giant mutant wolf-dog; tall and strong, very fierce-looking.</p> <p>Neither of those two people was ordinary; one of them was at level-seven while the other at level-six. The mutant dog was also a rarely seen high-leveled one.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng brought the two people and the dog to Wu Chengyue’s office door, then said to them, “Wait for a second, our Chief is in there.”</p> <p>Lei Cheng and the other man stopped walking and nodded without saying a word. His handsome face wore no expression.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng turned and knocked on the door, then pushed it open and took half a step forward as he said, “Chief, they’re here.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Wu Chengyue, who was reading some files behind his desk, immediately put down the pen in his hand and conveniently covered those files with a piece of paper before standing up from his chair.</p> <p>“Please come in!” he said.</p> <p>Xiao Licheng stepped outside, then gestured for the two to come in.</p> <p>After that, the two tall and muscular men walked into the office, the large dog quietly following behind them.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at the dog, then smilingly said to the two, “Nice to meet you. I am Wu Chengyue. May I ask your names?”</p> <p>The two men were at about the same height. The one who responded to Wu Chengyue was the slightly shorter and good-looking one.</p> <p>“My name is Lei Cheng, and this is Zheng Hao,” he said expressionlessly.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue pointed at the couch while saying, “Please have a seat. As you can see, I have a kid here. So… Can you please let your dog wait outside?”</p> <p>While speaking, he gave that extra large dog a guilty glance.</p> <p>The dog had been quietly and closely following behind Lei Cheng since it came in, without raising its head to look or sniff around.</p> <p>It didn’t have a leash, but was never even a step away from Lei Cheng. Wherever Lei Cheng went, it followed.</p> <p>Hearing Wu Chengyue’s request, Lei Cheng didn’t show any discontentment, but slightly lowered his head to say to the dog with a bland tone, “Erlei, go guard at the door.”</p> <p>After hearing his words, the dog raised its head to give him a glance, then quickly turned around and walked toward the door, with its tail dropped.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue knew that mutant dogs could be very smart and intelligent. Some of them could understand simple human language. Therefore, Wu Chengyue wasn’t surprised when the dog walked out obediently after its owner told it to do so.</p> <p>Mutant animals and plants had one thing in common—they could be stung to madness easily. If something affected the dog and made it go mad, there would be a trouble.</p> <p>Seeing strangers come in, Wu Yueling quickly turned and ran to the restroom nearby.</p> <p>As Lei Cheng and Zheng Hao sat down, Xiao Licheng poured each of them a glass of water and put them on the table before them. After that, he stood in the corner beside Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>“Where are you from? What can I do for you?” said Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Strangers always came to him for reasons. If they weren’t here to make troubles, they would surely be here to ask for help.</p> <p>Lei Cheng looked at him and said, “We’re here to ask about Tang He.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was puzzled for a second, as he had never heard that name before. “May I ask who is Tang He?”</p> <p>Lei Cheng glanced at Zheng Hao who sat beside him. Receiving his glance, the latter knowingly took out an A4-size paper from his bag along with a photo, then handed it to Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>“Chief Wu, this is Tang He. Maybe you don’t know his name, but I think many people in your base have already seen him,” Zheng Hao said after handing the file to Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue took over the file. At the sight of the photo, he recognized Tang He as no one else but Yang Chao’s helper who was pointed out that day in the conference hall by the female zombie.</p> <p>“Him? You’re looking for him?” He said with surprise.</p> <p>“This man is the traitor of our base. He committed a serious crime in our base, so he ran out. The base sent us to tackle him and bring him back,” said Lei Cheng.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at the two of them and said, “I see! But, Tang He seems to have level-seven metal power, and is good at attacking. I think it’ll be quite difficult for you two to catch him.”</p> <p>He didn’t tell Lei Cheng and Zheng Hao that he felt that they wouldn’t be able to catch Tang He even by joining hands.</p> <p>Level-seven superpowered human beings were rarely seen, and extremely hard to defeat. Normally, not even two same-level superpowered people could win against one level-seven person, not to mention capture him or her. Besides, escaping could be really easy for level-seven superpowered people.</p> <p>Lei Cheng nodded and said, “I know what you mean. We’re not the only two who came here, so you don’t need to worry about that.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at him. Abruptly, he chuckled and asked, “A mere squad from your base contains one level-seven and one level-six. May I ask where are you from? Are you from the Huaxia Base in Beijing?”</p> <p>Huaxia Base was the largest base so far. It was run by seven leaders, and all of them were level-eight beings.</p> <p>Among all bases in this country, only Huaxia Base had so many level-eight superpowered people. For that reason, Huaxia Base was the most powerful base in the country, and had no fear of any other base.</p> <p>The living conditions there were surely better than that in the second-grade bases, and it was safer to live in there than in the other bases.</p> <p>Huaxia Base was still recruiting residents. However, entering Huaxia Base required zombie nuclei. The residents in that base needed to pay the base monthly with nuclei, or they would be kicked out directly.</p> <p>As Lei Cheng was at level-seven, Wu Chengyue guessed that he and his people were from Huaxia Base, because it wasn’t far away from Sea City Base.</p> <p>Lei Cheng shook his head and said, “We can’t tell you anything about our base, but I can tell you that we have nothing to do with Huaxia Base.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at him with surprise, “Ah, is that so? Alright, I shouldn’t have asked it, sorry!”</p> <p>Lei Cheng remained expressionless the whole time. “It’s okay,” he said carelessly, “Don’t worry about it, Chief Wu! Now, you only need to tell us what happened before Tang He left. We’ll trade the information with this.”</p> <p>While speaking, he took out a zombie nuclei and put it before Wu Chengyue’s face.</p> <p>That was a level-six zombie nucleus!</p>",
  "Chapter 385: Tang He’s Information": "<p>Wu Chengyue glanced at the zombie nucleus, wondering if he could successfully step into level-eight after absorbing it. If that could happen, he would be able to fix the decline of the strength of the base caused by Yang Chao’s death.</p> <p>“Ah, I think he was here to help a traitor of our base. But for some reason, he ran away in the middle of the fight that day,” he said.</p> <p>Lei Cheng stayed silent. Unlike him, Zheng Hao said with surprise, “Eh? You have a traitor as well. Two traitors got together. As the old saying goes, birds of a feather flock together.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue spread his hands and said, “A former leader of our base ran a secret experiment with healthy people. So, the other leader of our base and I executed him.”</p> <p>“Did you catch Tang He that day?” said Lei Cheng, seeming to only care about Tang He’s whereabouts.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue responded, “We didn’t… Chief Zou was chasing him that day. He soon ran out of the base, and we didn’t follow him out. It seemed that he never planned to risk his life fighting us.”</p> <p>Lei Cheng didn’t ask any further questions, but stood up and politely nodded at Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>“That information is enough for us. Thank you for your time, Chief Wu.” he said.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue stood up as well. As the two prepared to leave so soon, he asked with surprise, “Eh? You’re leaving already?”</p> <p>Lei Cheng nodded and said, “We’re on a mission, so we won’t linger any longer. Thank you!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue had no other choice but to respond while walking to the door, “Alright, goodbye! Licheng, show them out.”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng walked them out of the base, then came back to report, “They left the base. Chief, do you know where they came from?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue shook his head and said, “I don’t know. They seem to be looking for that level-seven man named Tang He.” Then, he asked the other, “Haven’t you found out about that female zombie’s background yet?”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng helplessly shook his head. He failed to find anything about that female zombie, not because he wasn’t capable enough, but because it was an impossible mission. Yuan Tianxing and his people had left the base long ago, so he could only try to find useful information from the few who were still here.</p> <p>The level-five superpowered man named Du Yuanxing usually seemed to be a little silly. But when it came to the female zombie, he just wouldn’t say even one word, no matter how the others asked.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue said while rubbing his chin, “It’s been so long, but we still didn’t find anything. Miss. Zombie is so mysterious.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>While Wu Chengyue was trying very hard to dig up information about Lin Qiao, the latter was still wrapped in the vine sphere. During the past few days, one-third of the enormous vine sphere had disappeared, and the rest was still slowly seeping into her body.</p> <p>Shen Yujen stayed by the lakeside and looked into the lake from time to time. She waited for days, but still didn’t see Lin Qiao come up.</p> <p>Ever since she witnessed Wu Chengyue walk into the lake nakedly, Shen Yujen had been wondering if what happened in the lake was like she had thought.</p> <p>At first, Lin Qiao went down naked, and after her, Wu Chengyue went into the lake naked as well. A man and a woman, both naked… What could they possibly do down in the lake?</p> <p>Also, Wu Chengyue carried Lin Qiao up at last. If someone told Shen Yuzhen that nothing happened between them, she wouldn’t believe it for her life!</p> <p>After Wu Chengyue left, that vine plant brought Lin Qiao back into the lake. She hadn’t yet come up, and Shen Yuzhen didn’t know what she was doing down there.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Qiao was still unconscious. Viney turned into a stream of energy, seeping into her body. That energy was nourishing every muscle of hers, activating her cells and purifying her blood.</p> <p>The cells which had been activated earlier were weeded out and burned away by a wisp of black mist.</p> <p>After being repaired by Viney’s energy again and again, Lin Qiao’s dead cells had all been replaced. Only her internal organs were still growing with time.</p> <p>At that time, Viney’s great healing energy was doing the last part of the repair work—Lin Qiao’s intestines.</p> <p>New intestines had been slowly growing inside her body.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the other types of energies that belonged to Viney had been gathering toward Lin Qiao’s lower abdomen. What was also lingering in that area was a masculine type of energy.</p> <p>Viney’s vibe entered the territory of that masculine energy and mixed with it, then began slowly rotating and merging. However, that merger was happening much slower than the renewal of Lin Qiao’s cells.</p> <p>The growth of Lin Qiao’s intestines was also very slow. Meanwhile, her purified fresh blood started to flowing back into her heart.</p> <p>At the same time, in Hades Base…</p> <p>In the conference hall of the administration building, a tall and slim man was standing before the French window, looking at the base which now had much fewer people than before. That man had shoulder-length hair and a pretty face. He had narrow and upturning eyes, light eyebrows, straight nose, and thin and sexy lips.</p> <p>A faint, confident smile was seen on the corners of his mouth. His eyes had an indescribable, watery luster that looked warm and moist, also somehow tempting.</p> <p>His delicate face concealed his gender; because of his long hair, he looked a little like a girl.</p> <p>He stood there quietly, radiating an elegant and refreshing vibe.</p> <p>The door of the conference hall suddenly opened and a soldier stood at the door, speaking to him, “Chief, Deputy Chief Yang is back.”</p> <p>Long Yubai turned back and gave the soldier a gentle and warm smile before responding, “He’s back? Tell him to come in then.”</p> <p>Looking at his smiling face, the soldier was stunned for a second, but soon hid his feeling well and turned to leave.</p> <p>After that, Yang Jianhua walked in.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua was wearing a white suit. A beam of light flashed across his eyes when he saw Long Yubai.</p> <p>He walked to him with big steps, then put his arms around Long Yubai’s slim and straight body from behind. After that, he put his face near his ear and took a deep breath, then looked at him obsessively.</p> <p>“Did you miss me?” he said.</p> <p>Long Yubai’s pretty face was still wearing a faint smile. He turned back slightly to say to Yang Jianhua, “How are things going?”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua paused briefly, then said carelessly, “They ran away. I’ve chased them far away. I believe that they won’t come back.”</p> <p>Long Yubai continued smiling, yet his eyes glowed with a cold light, “Come back? This base has become like this. What could they possibly do even if they came back? We’ve already taken away all the supplies in this base. This base is useless to us now. You should know that I want you to kill those people to prevent future problems.”</p>",
  "Chapter 386: The One Who Was Being Used": "<p>Yang Jianhua’s handsome face wore a faint, fawning smile. “I almost had them,” he said, “but Yuan Tianxing suddenly showed up. I couldn’t kill all those people as he was there.”</p> <p>Long Yubai pulled Yang Jianhua’s arm away, then took a step back to turn and walk toward his desk. Yang Jianhua was slightly displeased, but didn’t show his feelings. Instead, he turned and followed behind the other.</p> <p>“So, you were gone for so long, but returned with empty hands? Did you come back alone? Have you abandoned the ten vehicles that I gave you?” Long Yubai asked him while walking.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua walked up behind him and abruptly reached out to drag him before he was sitting into his chair. While pulling him backward, he said with some discontent, “Do you only care whether those people have died or not? And your vehicles? What about me?”</p> <p>Long Yubai wasn’t as tall and strong as Yang Jianhua, so he fell straight into the latter’s arms when he pulled him. And then, Yang Jianhua again put his arms around him.</p> <p>Hearing Yang Jianhua’s words, he sighed, “We spent quite some efforts to arm those vehicles. I gave them to you, but you left them out there. You failed to kill those people, which is okay, because they can’t possibly make any troubles now.”</p> <p>“As long as you know that,” said Yang Jianhua to him. “It’s my bad to lose those cars. I had no other choice. I met someone stronger than me, so I could only save my own life first. The mission wouldn’t have failed if I could upgrade to level-seven.”</p> <p>Long Yubai put his head before Yang Jianhua’s chest and slightly lowered it. From Yang Jianhua’s angle, only his dropping eyelashes were seen, but not the displeased look on his eyes.</p> <p>Then, he raised his head and looked at Yang Jianhua with a pair of watery eyes, saying, “Jianhua, as I’ve said, I’ll give you that level-six zombie nucleus as long as you go back to the Earth Dragon Base with me, so you can step straight into level-seven. But, you just wouldn’t go back with me. What are you staying here for?”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua looked at those eyes and his delicate face. His eyes soon landed on Long Yubai’s lips, and then his throat somehow became dry.</p> <p>He lowered his head to kiss Long Yubai’s lips.</p> <p>His wet and slippery tongue eagerly swept across Long Yubai’s lips, then forced open his teeth, intruding his mouth and stirring aggressively.</p> <p>Long Yubai slightly narrowed his eyes, letting Yang Jianhua’s tongue churn in his mouth. He put both hands on Yang Jianhua’s strong chest and stroked it slowly and gently before putting his arms around the other’s neck.</p> <p>The passionate kiss lasted for quite a while before their lips parted.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua breathed heavily as he pressed his crotch area tightly against Long Yubai’s body.</p> <p>Long Yubai raised his slightly misty eyes and looked at Yang Jianhua as he said, “Since you’ve returned, just come to the Earth Dragon Base with me.”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua spent a moment to catch his breath, then responded, “Haven’t you agreed to give me the Hades Base? Why do you still want me to go to the Earth Dragon Base with you?”</p> <p>Long Yubai said, “But, the two bases are hundreds of miles away from each other. It’s such a long distance. If you don’t go with me, you won’t be able to be with me every day, will you?”</p> <p>“Why do I have to go with you?” said Yang Jianhua, “Isn’t it good for me to stay here? This base now belongs to me alone. Wouldn’t it be a waste if I gave it up like this?”</p> <p>Long Yubai gazed into his eyes for a while, then said, “Is this destroyed base what you don’t want to give up, or something else?”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua paused for a second, then slightly loosened his embrace and asked, “What do you mean?”</p> <p>Long Yubai pushed him away, then silently turned and walked outside.</p> <p>He was already running out of patience to keep wasting his time on Yang Jianhua. If the latter wasn’t a level-six superpowered man who could still do a lot of things for him, he would have fallen out with him already.</p> <p>Long Yubai was a smart person. He wasn’t capable enough to found and manage a base, but he knew how to find people to do that for him.</p> <p>He made the people who were obsessed with him willingly work for him… And Yang Jianhua was one of them.</p> <p>In fact, he didn’t put many efforts in building the Earth Dragon Base. That base was basically built by some other people and then gifted to him.</p> <p>Unlike some of Long Yubai’s other suitors, Yang Jianhua wasn’t a faithful man. He simply wanted everything that he liked. He was already on Long Yubai’s side, but still wasn’t willing to give up on Lin Wenwen. Long Yubai knew it all.</p> <p>With a dark face, Yang Jianhua watched Long Yubai walk out.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After a whole week, Lin Qiao finally woke up from unconsciousness.</p> <p>She woke up to see nothing but darkness. But soon, she sensed the changes which had been happening inside her body and around her. She felt that Viney’s energy had filled up her entire body. Her every cell, and her blood now all contained that warm, healing energy.</p> <p>She also felt waves of hunger from her stomach, and that feeling made her swallow saliva unwittingly.</p> <p>She felt a little strange about it. Why did she feel hungry? She had been easing her hunger by drinking the lake water ever since she became a zombie. She hadn’t sensed hunger for quite a while.</p> <p>What was happening to her now?</p> <p>She was surrounded by Viney’s energy, but the weird thing was that she didn’t detect Viney’s vibe from it.</p> <p><em>‘Eh?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Viney, are you there?’ </em>She called Viney in her head.</p> <p>She guessed that she was still in the lake, and her body was entirely wrapped in energy. That did not feel exactly the same as what happened before, but based on what she experienced before, she could still figure out her current situation.</p> <p><em>‘Mama! You’re finally awake!’ </em>Viney’s voice was heard in her mind.</p> <p><em>‘Where are you? Why can’t I feel your vibe anymore? Are you still in the lake?’ </em>Lin Qiao asked <em>.</em></p> <p><em>‘Mama, I have completed my upgrade… Where am I? Em… Viney is in Mama’s belly! </em>‘ Viney’s voice was a little unclear.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt even stranger.</p> <p>In her belly? How come Viney went into her belly? What did that mean?</p> <p><em>‘How can you be in my belly? You’re so huge. Can you get into my belly?’ </em>She couldn’t help but ask.</p> <p>Viney responded, <em>‘Mama, in fact, the Viney you saw before was only energy… Viney doesn’t have a real body. This time, in order to upgrade Mama and repair Mama’s body, I have injected all the energy into Mama… With no spare energy to rely on, Viney had no choice but to come into Mama’s belly… </em>‘</p> <p>Didn’t Viney have a real body?</p> <p>Lin Qiao was stunned.</p> <p><em>‘Viney actually has no real body. So, were those vines that I saw all formed from energy? </em>‘ Lin Qiao wondered.</p>",
  "Chapter 387: The Vine Entrapped Its Mama": "<p>Lin Qiao suddenly remembered that earlier on, she was… raped by a man, and that was planned by Viney!</p> <p>Did Viney bring a man into the space, made them have sexual intercourse, and then put herself into her belly?</p> <p>Lin Qiao was stunned. “Viney! You didn’t… go into my uterus, did you? Are you going to become my child?’</p> <p><em>‘Mama guessed it out? </em>‘ Viney’s excited voice could immediately be heard from her mind, <em>‘Yeah, Viney is already in Mama’s belly… I have gotten Mama’s egg and Daddy’s sperm, and then put them together! Now, they have become Viney’s body! But, it’s still very, very tiny…’</em></p> <p>After receiving that affirmative answer from Viney, Lin Qiao was dumbfounded.</p> <p><em>‘Damn!’</em></p> <p><em>‘Wait a moment! Am I not a zombie? I’ve already died! Why can I still get pregnant!’</em></p> <p><em>‘Viney… Are you joking with me?’ She couldn’t help but ask.</em></p> <p><em>‘Viney isn’t joking with Mama, </em>‘ Viney responded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao still couldn’t believe it. <em>‘How can you possibly be in my belly then? I am a zombie. How can I still get pregnant?’</em></p> <p>Even though she was raped by a man, it wouldn’t be possible for her to get pregnant, would it? Also, getting pregnant after only one sexual intercourse also sounded not quite possible. Could the conception rate be so high?</p> <p><em>‘You can, because Viney has reactivated Mama’s body with all her energy. It required a man to stimulate Mama, so Mama’s body can be reactivated. That’s why I asked Mama to find a man. Now, I have used up all the energy to upgrade Mama and reactivate Mama’s body, and have no energy left to maintain my energy body. So, I ran into Mama’s belly, because Daddy’s sperm is in here…’</em></p> <p>Viney wanted to tell Lin Qiao that she had used up all her energy to repair Lin Qiao’s body, and that to repair her body, a man was actually needed because the process had to happen during the sexual intercourse.</p> <p>Lin Qiao understood that Viney did all that to help her, but somehow, she also felt that Viney had created her a huge trouble.</p> <p>She didn’t even know how to react!</p> <p>“So… So you got a man in here for me? And you did it behind my back! Why didn’t you make it clear with me beforehand? Also, who was that man?” Lin Qiao was already a little confused.</p> <p><em>‘Because… because… because the little one… the little one likes Mama very much,’</em>Viney replied <em>, ‘She said that she wants you to be her Mama too. So… so… that man was the little one’s Daddy…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Who </em>?’ said Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘The little one’s daddy… </em>‘ said Viney.</p> <p><em>‘Get out! I’m going to kill you </em>!’ Lin Qiao burst in screams inside her head.</p> <p><em>‘God! You could have picked any man! Why on earth did you choose that one? Last time, he was raped by Lu Tianyu, and this time, he was again entrapped by me… Ugh, no, by Viney!’</em></p> <p><em>‘And I was entrapped too!’</em></p> <p>She remembered that that man was clear-minded! He clearly knew who she was, but she didn’t know who he was!</p> <p>This time, it was she who got raped! It was her who wasn’t able to resist when it happened, not him!</p> <p><em>‘Ahyaya, Mama, calm down! If you got too angry and that causes a spontaneous abortion, Viney would be dead </em>…’ said Viney fearfully.</p> <p>Spontaneous abortion…</p> <p>Lin Qiao just didn’t know what to say.</p> <p><em>‘I </em><em>need to calm down! Calm down! Calm down! This is important, I need to calm… Ugh! Calm my a*s! You awful little vine! It could be any man, but why did you choose Wu Chengyue, that fake-smile-faced fox!’</em></p> <p><em>‘You’re so powerful that you even created your own body,’ </em>Lin Qiao said in her head with anger <em>, ‘Are you still afraid that you might be aborted? How did you manage to make a zombie and a human have a baby? Come out and tell me, just tell me!’</em></p> <p>She had such complicated feelings at the moment. She was angry, surprised, delighted… and worried!</p> <p>She was angry because Viney actually did such an important thing without telling her about it beforehand. If any accident happened, Viney would lose all her energy and fall into danger!</p> <p>What if she didn’t get pregnant after having sexual intercourse with that man? Where would Viney go find her body?</p> <p><em>‘Em… wait! Damn, how can I forget that… that man seemed to have had quite a long ejaculation in the end?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Em… em… That’s because it seems that Mama doesn’t like the little one’s Daddy… If I told you, you might not agree… The little one would cry…’ </em>said Viney carefully.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought about it and agreed. If Viney told her that that man would be Wu Chengyue, she would definitely refuse.</p> <p>She said grumpily, <em>‘Is that why you entrapped your Mama? You made me get raped by him! How did you get him in here? Also, if he’s a mentally healthy person, he wouldn’t do that to me. What did you do to him?’</em></p> <p><em>‘Hehe, Viney has upgraded </em>,’ said Viney, <em>‘I can’t go out, but I can release my energy through Mama’s body. That’s how I brought the little one’s Daddy in.’</em></p> <p>After saying that, Viney paused for a second, then continued, <em>‘Em, when he came in, I didn’t do much to him… I only released a scent that implies reproduction, and made him sniff it… After that, he entered that kind of state…’</em></p> <p>Imply reproduction? What the hell was that? What that… aphrodisiac?</p> <p><em>‘So, he knew what was happening. He was clear-minded, but couldn’t control himself. At that time, Viney sent the naked me into his arms! Viney just threw me on him…’</em></p> <p><em>‘So by now, Viney has created her own body by making us have sexual intercourse! She was going to become a real baby!’</em></p> <p><em>‘Are you really in my uterus now? </em>‘ Lin Qiao asked <em>, ‘Did you turn me back into a human being, and then put yourself into my belly? And you told me nothing about all these before you took action. Are you aware that you were being deceitful?’ </em>The more she said, the angrier she sounded.</p> <p>Sensing that Lin Qiao was really getting angry, Viney immediately apologized with a fawning tone and a sweet voice, <em>‘Hmmm… Mama, I’m sorry… Please don’t be angry… I won’t do it again… </em>‘</p> <p><em>‘Now you’re saying sorry. Why didn’t you tell about all that earlier?’ </em>said Lin Qiao crossly.</p> <p><em>‘Hmmm… Because I was worried that Mama might not want to do it with the little one’s Daddy…’ </em>said Viney, sounding almost in tears.</p>",
  "Chapter 388: Still Shocked": "<p>Hearing Viney’s trembling voice, Lin Qiao couldn’t be angry anymore. She had known Viney for a long while after all. Viney could be willful sometimes, but she understood that the other did all she did just to help her.</p> <p>With that thought, Lin Qiao cooled down slowly.</p> <p>After thinking for a moment, she asked, <em>‘What’s my current body condition like then? Is it still not repaired yet?’</em></p> <p>She wanted to touch her own body, but couldn’t move her limbs.</p> <p>As she changed the topic, Viney immediately sighed with relief and said,<em>‘Mama’s body has already been activated! However, only one-third of you is activated, and the rest is not. As long as your body finishes absorbing Viney’s energy, you can go out.’</em></p> <p><em>‘Is my heart alive too </em>?’ said Lin Qiao with surprise.</p> <p>She couldn’t have expected that Viney had actually reactivated her heart and brought her back to life. Her body, which belonged to Lu Tianyu, had been dead for months. But now, it actually came back to life! Viney had such a miraculous power!</p> <p>Viney responded, <em>‘Yeah, yeah… It required your own energy, Daddy’s energy, and Viney’s energy to activate your body… Mama, you may still need to spend two more days to absorb the energy before you’re able to go out.’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, <em>‘Alright… two more days? How long have I been down here then? </em>‘</p> <p>Viney spent a moment counting, then replied, <em>‘Em… em… I think it has been eight days. </em>‘</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed. It seemed that she needed to wait two more days.</p> <p>She didn’t know how to face Wu Chengyue when she got out. The situation would be less weird if he didn’t know who she was; but the fact was, he knew it clearly.</p> <p>It would definitely be really awkward when they saw each other again, even though neither of them did it voluntarily. So, it would be better for them to never see each other again. If Wu Chengyue found out that Lin Qiao’s body actually belonged to Lu Tianyu, things would become even more complicated.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao decided to leave as soon as possible when she was freed from the lake. She planned to go to the new base and see how things were going there. If the situation was good, she would leave for the South, also to avoid Wu Chengyue.</p> <p><em>‘Viney, in the future, you must talk to me first before doing something so important, do you understand? </em>‘ she said in her head, <em>‘If you’re really going to become my child, I might spank you when you misbehave!’</em></p> <p>As Lin Qiao seemed to have forgiven her, Viney responded happily, <em>‘I’m sorry, I will never do it again…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Great then </em>!’ said Lin Qiao, <em>‘Also, does he know that I’m pregnant? You didn’t tell him, did you?’</em></p> <p>Viney stayed silent, which gave Lin Qiao a very bad feeling.</p> <p><em>‘You, you, you didn’t tell him, did you!’</em></p> <p>If Viney were standing right in front of her, she should be able to see the little vine fidgeting with her fingers, showing a guilty face. In fact, Viney had no fingers, so she would probably fidget with her vines!</p> <p><em>‘I… I told him… Viney told Daddy everything…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Why on earth did you tell him </em>!’ Lin Qiao nearly exploded, <em>‘He’ll definitely come after me! And you actually call him Daddy!’</em></p> <p>God! If that man knew that she was pregnant with his baby, and that baby was Viney, who had entrapped her, would he ever let Lin Qiao and Viney get out of this?</p> <p>No, he wouldn’t!</p> <p>By now, it was no longer about who was right and who was wrong. The one who raped him last time was Lu Tianyu, not Lin Qiao. However, by taking over Lu Tianyu’s body, Lin Qiao had taken over her sin as well. This time, because of Viney, she ended up being raped by him. At the moment, Lin Qiao had a feeling that her future life would be disorganized by Wu Chengyue!</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt extremely uncomfortable about what had happened, and was still deeply shocked…</p> <p><em>‘But, he is already Viney’s Daddy… </em>‘ said Viney.</p> <p>Lin Qiao just didn’t know what to say.</p> <p><em>‘Can I kill this naughty child whose name is Viney? She sold her mother, didn’t she?’</em></p> <p>Viney sensed her thoughts.</p> <p><em>‘What should I do? I can’t go out now, or Mama will spank me! </em>‘ she thought.</p> <p>Just like that, Lin Qiao and Viney spent two more days in the lake.</p> <p>On the other side, Xiao Licheng, who had been digging under Wu Chengyue’s orders, finally found some leads about the female zombie.</p> <p>“Did you say that it was a man on Chief Zou’s side who did this?” Wu Chengyue sat on the couch with Wu Yueling on his knees as he raised his head to look at Xiao Licheng with surprise.</p> <p>The other stood in the empty area before him, nodding and responding, “Yes, it’s the man named Kong Qingming. He has been secretly hindering our investigation the whole time.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue rubbed his chin while asking, “Why is he trying to stop us from finding out that female zombie’s background? Is there an inside story about her?”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng shook his head. After thinking for a moment, he made a guess, “Is he trying to protect Miss. Lu? Didn’t she save him and his friends in Hangzhou? Maybe he thinks that we’re going to do something bad to her!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at him and said, “What bad thing can we possibly do to her? We are partners now, aren’t we? Does he think that we’re immoral people? She helped me, so why would I try to hurt her?”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng shrugged and said, “About that, I think we need to ask him directly.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue put Wu Yueling on the floor, then stood up and said, “Alright. Since he knows something, we will go straight to him and talk to him instead of spending so many efforts trying to find out. If he refuses to tell us, we’d have no choice but to ask Zou for help.”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng didn’t expect him to plan to go straight to Kong Qingming. “Eh!” he looked at Wu Chengyue confusedly and exclaimed.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue gave him a glance, then picked up Wu Yueling’s hand and said while heading outside, “What? Let’s go! Where is he now?”</p> <p>“Yes, sir!” Xiao Licheng immediately followed behind him.</p> <p>On the other side, Kong Qingming was lying on the couch in Lu Tianyi’s office, saying with a frown, “I think… I’m about to fail in concealing the information about your sister. Also, I think they might have noticed us. If Chief Wu finds us, how to do plan to deal with him?”</p> <p>While speaking, he looked at Lu Tianyi, who was sitting behind the desk.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi stopped writing and raised his head. He paused for a moment, then thought for a while and turned to Kong Qingming, “If he really came to us, I think we can first ask him about his purpose. Why on earth does he keep digging about my sister? What is he up to?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming paused in shock. “Ask him directly? Do you really dare to do that?” he said while giving Lu Tianyi a glance with surprise.</p> <p>At that moment, a guard knocked on the door before coming in, “Boss, Chief Wu is here.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming were both a little speechless.</p> <p>Speak of the devil!</p> <p>They glanced at each other, then hurriedly stood up. After that, they saw Wu Chengyue walk in, holding Wu Yueling’s hand. Following behind them were Xiao Licheng and two soldiers.</p> <p>“Chief, what brought you here?” Lu Tianyi greeted him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled and responded, “Why? Am I not allowed in here?”</p> <p>“Of course, you are!” said Lu Tianyi awkwardly, “We’re just a little flattered by your sudden visit. Please have a seat!”</p> <p>Both of them stepped away from the couch and offered it to Wu Chengyue, who sat down with Ling Ling, then pointed at the other couch in the office and waved at the two.</p> <p>“You two sit down as well. Let’s talk!”</p>",
  "Chapter 389: A Huge Misunderstanding": "<p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming glanced at each other, both wearing a worried look. After that, Lu Tianyi turned to get some water for Wu Chengyue while Kong Qingming sat down uneasily.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned around and gave Xiao Licheng a glance. Receiving the glance, the latter knowingly left with the two soldiers.</p> <p>As all the others left, and only Wu Chengyue, Lu Tianyi, Kong Qingming, and the little one were left in the office, Wu Chengyue smilingly looked at the two and started talking.</p> <p>“I heard that you’ve been hindering my people on their missions. I’d like to know what exactly is going on.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi heard Wu Chengyue’s words as he put a few glasses of water on the table and sat down. He looked at Wu Chengyue, pretending not to know anything. “Eh? What mission? Did we hamper your work, Chief Wu?”</p> <p>A strange gleam of light flashed across Wu Chengyue’s narrowed, smiling eyes. Then, he said jokingly, seemingly with discontentment, “Alright, you are pretending.”</p> <p>“Kong, you tell me then…” He abruptly turned to Kong Qingming and said.</p> <p>“Eh?” Kong Qingming didn’t expect Wu Chengyue to turn to him while talking to Lu Tianyi suddenly, so he didn’t manage to react timely.</p> <p>“What ‘eh’? Tell me, why wouldn’t you let my people find the information about Miss. Lu? Have you been protecting her? Why?” Wu Chengyue spoke directly.</p> <p>Hearing his straightforward question, Kong Qingming didn’t know how to respond, so he turned to glance at Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>“Chief, can we ask why you suddenly want the information about her?” Lu Tianyi threw a question back, “If you give us a good reason, we might tell you what we know about her.”</p> <p>The smile on Wu Chengyue’s face turned a little mysterious as he responded, “Because I’m very interested in her now. Is that reason good enough?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming glanced at each other, both remaining silent.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue turned to Ling Ling as he rubbed her head and sighed, “I wasn’t going to publicize this yet, so after hearing what I’m about to say, you need to keep it secret for me.”</p> <p>Both Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming had their eyes glowed.</p> <p>Was Chief Wu going to tell them about his purpose? They didn’t expect that to happen so soon.</p> <p>They were really surprised that Wu Chengyue would actually tell them about his true purpose.</p> <p>“I want her to be my Ling Ling’s mother, also my wife. So, it’s reasonable for me to want to dig out her background, isn’t it?” said Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming were left open-mouthed. They stared at Wu Chengyue, their faces filled with disbelief.</p> <p>“Wait a moment, wait a moment! Chief Wu, what did you say? I didn’t hear it clearly!” Lu Tianyi hurriedly raised a hand to point at Wu Chengyue and said in shock. Kong Qingming paused in shock for a few seconds, then wore a weird expression.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue looked at Lu Tianyi’s shocked face, then laughed and responded, “I said I want her to be my wife. What’s wrong about that?”</p> <p>“No!” After hearing him repeating that, Lu Tianyi said no without thinking.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was confused by Lu Tianyi’s attitude. With a complicated expression, he asked, “Why? You have nothing to do with her, right? Em… eh, you’re not fond of her as well, are you?”</p> <p>“Pah!” Kong Qingming picked up a glass of water and took a sip after processing what he had heard earlier. However, he sprayed that water right out after hearing what Wu Chengyue said just now.</p> <p>“Pah!” Lu Tianyi also spouted the water in his mouth. After saying no, he had picked up a glass and taken a sip of water as well to ease the awkward atmosphere, because he realized that he might have said the wrong words.</p> <p>And hence, they both spouted the water in their mouths after hearing Wu Chengyue’s words.</p> <p>“Eh-hem…” While coughing, they embarrassedly wiped their mouths.</p> <p>“It’s not like that… eh-hem…” Lu Tianyi said anxiously while raising a hand to try and stop Wu Chengyue from talking</p> <p>“No? Then, why were you so emotional just now? So, you like women who’re older than you… Do you know about her true identity?” The smile on Wu Chengyue’s face had turned a little weird.</p> <p>“No… It’s not like that! Chief, please don’t misunderstand me! It’s not like what you said,” That misunderstanding which Wu Chengyue had made Lu Tianyi really uncomfortable. While trying to explain, he hurriedly waved his hands and shook his head.</p> <p>Kong Qingming, who sat beside Lu Tianyi, covered his forehead with a hand after wiping his mouth, seeming to be trying very hard to stop himself from laughing out loud.</p> <p>The smile on Wu Chengyue’s face faded slightly as he looked at Lu Tianyi and said with surprise, “Is it really not like that? But you reacted so strongly…”</p> <p>“It’s definitely not like that! It’s impossible for me to be with her! But Chief, it’s also… not quite possible for you to be with her either!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue paused for a moment at first, then looked at him confusedly and asked, “Why? Do you know her true identity?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lu Tianyi paused briefly as well, then glanced at Kong Qingming. After that, he turned back to Wu Chengyue and asked, “Do you already know?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded and said, “I know that she’s not human. She’s a zombie. Isn’t that what you don’t want me to find out?”</p> <p><em>‘It… is… not! What I don’t want you to find out is that she’s my sister who had raped you! </em>‘ said Lu Tianyi in his head.</p> <p>He silently stared at Wu Chengyue for a few seconds, and Kong Qingming was stunned as well.</p> <p>That seemed to be a huge misunderstanding…</p> <p>Kong Qingming looked at Wu Chengyue and said with a strange expression, “Eh, Chief, so you already know that she’s not human. Then why do you… still…”</p> <p>“As you’ve seen, even though she’s a zombie, she’s no different from normal human beings, except for her special eyes. Also, she’s nice, isn’t she? She has saved your lives, so you should know about that. I’ve spent some time with her lately, and I have a feeling that she’s a decent soul,” said Wu Chengyue.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming both gazed at him silently.</p> <p><em>‘Chief, she has raped you. Are you sure that you wouldn’t beat her after finding out who she truly is? Although, you’ve already battled once,’ </em>Lu Tianyi thought.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue had no clue about the complicated feelings of the two. He only thought that they were worried that he might regret after learning that Lin Qiao was a zombie. With a faint smile, he said, “In fact, I was already quite interested in her before, not so much that I wanted to marry her though. But now, things are different. I’ve already eaten her. As a man, I need to be responsible for her. What’s also very important, Ling Ling likes her a lot.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>What did they just hear? Eh… It didn’t sound right!</p> <p>With hesitation, Lu Tianyi asked, “Ugh, Chief, what did you say just now? I don’t quite understand! What did you mean by you’ve already eaten her?”</p> <p>It wasn’t like what he thought, is it?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue glanced at Ling Ling, then turned back to him and replied, “Well, you’re an adult, so I think you should understand what I meant.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming slightly opened their mouths but failed to say a word. They were both astonished. They couldn’t believe that! How on earth did those two get together! What in the world had happened!</p>",
  "Chapter 390: You Said You Won’t Lose Temper": "<p>Wu Chengyue didn’t notice the complicated expressions of the two earlier. However, as a capable leader, he had now noticed that something was not quite right.</p> <p>He blinked as he glanced at Lu Tianyi, then at Kong Qingming. “Your expressions told me that… This doesn’t seem to be right,” he looked at both of them and said abruptly, “I slept… um, did that thing with that female zombie. Why are you so surprised about that? Do you know who she really is?”</p> <p>He wanted to stay that he slept with the female zombie, but changed his words once he realized that Ling Ling was right beside him.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming glanced at each other. They know that the female zombie was Lu Tianyu, and also felt that Wu Chengyue would eventually find out about it.</p> <p>They understood that what they did earlier could only keep Wu Chengyue from digging up the truth for a while. What they didn’t think was that Kong Qingming was actually capable enough to keep the information secret from Wu Chengyue for so long.</p> <p>They both hesitated for a short while, then Lu Tianyi carefully said to Wu Chengyue, “In fact, we don’t care if you have eaten her… And… um, well, we’re indeed surprised by that. May I ask how did you sleep with her? When? Was there a special cause?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue smiled, “I surely cannot tell you about the cause unless you tell me everything you know about her. As for how I slept with her, that’s not important. What is important now is that she’s already mine! I need to be responsible for her, and she also needs to be responsible for me.”</p> <p>The two didn’t know what to say.</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue sounded so firm, the two wondered if he was aware that the one he was talking about was Lu Tianyu, the woman who had raped him, and used to be hated by everyone in the base. What would his face look like when he found out about that?</p> <p>Lu Tianyi suddenly started looking forward to Wu Chengyue’s reaction.</p> <p>“Eh… Are you sure that you want to know who she really was? I mean the identity she had before turning into a zombie,” he said.</p> <p>Kong Qingming glanced at Lu Tianyi and asked a question with his eyes— <em>‘Are you really gonna tell him?’</em></p> <p><em>‘He’ll find out sooner or later </em>,’ Lu Tianyi also responded with eyes.</p> <p>Kong Qingming thought for a moment, then replied, <em>‘I’ll leave then!’</em></p> <p><em>‘No, you can’t leave! Let’s die together </em>!’ said Lu Tianyi with his eyes.</p> <p>As the two were communicating with eyes, Wu Chengyue showed a complicated look in his eyes. “What’s wrong? Is her background complicated or scary?” he asked.</p> <p>Kong Qingming looked at him, said, “Um, later on when you find out about her true identity, please don’t lose your temper.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi nodded in agreement, “Ugh, Chief, if you’re going to flip out later on, please wait until we get out!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was confused by their words as he asked, filled with curiosity, “Why would I flip out? What on earth is going on? You two are acting weird!”</p> <p>“Chief, I won’t tell you anything until you promise us that you won’t go mad !” said Lu Tianyi.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue agreed without hesitation, “Alright, I get it! Besides, I don’t flip out easily. You both know what kind of person I am.”</p> <p><em>‘We know exactly what kind of person you are, so we understand how terrifying you’d be when you flip out.’ </em>The two said silently in their heads.</p> <p>As Wu Chengyue promised not to be mad, Lu Tianyi started talking, “Think about it, her last name is Lu, and she’s already dead. Now, she has unexpectedly become a zombie.”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue nodded as he looked at him and asked, “Then?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi swallowed his saliva, then continued slowly, “Um… My last name is Lu as well. You know… I came to you before…”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was puzzled at first, then paused for a short while to think.</p> <p>Lu was their shared last name? Lu Tianyi came to him once to ask about where Lu Tianyu died, also talked about finding her body. That was a long time ago…</p> <p>Em… Lu?</p> <p>While thinking, Wu Chengyue suddenly realized something. He fixed his eyes on Lu Tianyi and said, “You’re saying that her last name is Lu, so is yours… Is that what you meant? Earlier on, you came to me because you wanted to find your sister’s body, right?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming didn’t even dare to breathe. They slowly nodded, and were both ready to turn and run.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue spent three seconds staring at them silently. After that, a faint smile emerged on his face again as he said, “So, you’re saying that… she is Lu Tianyu, right?”</p> <p>No wonder he always found her face familiar! Now, he finally realized that it was Lu Tianyu’s face without makeup! No wonder he felt that he had seen her somewhere before!</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming paused briefly. They didn’t nod, neither did they make any sounds, but only gave him a weird smile.</p> <p>After that, the expression on Wu Chengyue’s face became quite interesting. The faint smile stayed on his face, while a strange light sparkled in his eyes. Meanwhile, two veins slowly bulged on the corners of his forehead.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming were both frozen, not daring to move at all. At that moment, Wu Chengyue’s vibe was already a little agitated, and that dangerous vibe shrouded the entire office.</p> <p>The two were crying on the inside.</p> <p><em>‘Liar! What happened to ‘you won’t flip out’? What are you doing! This is even scarier! Please stop smiling! Your veins are even bulging! We’d rather see your expressionless face!’</em></p> <p>Feeling the sudden change of the atmosphere, the sensitive Wu Yueling raised her head to glance at Wu Chengyue’s face, then inched her way to his side and dragged his sleeve.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s vibe immediately melted. He sighed as he looked at Wu Yueling and asked her, “Ling Ling, what should I do? Daddy really wants to fight someone now! Should I find that zombie lady and fight her now? Eh?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at him confusedly, without understanding his meaning.</p> <p><em>‘Fight? Fight whom? Didn’t Daddy say that we shouldn’t fight unless we have to?’</em></p> <p>“Hah, Chief… Eh… I mean… You’ve already fought her. Have you forgotten about that? Ugh… You even bit her thigh!” As Wu Chengyue’s scary vibe was eased by Wu Yueling’s one single move, Lu Tianyi immediately sighed in relief. Hearing the other’s childish words which were probably spoken to vent his anger, Lu Tianyi couldn’t help but laugh and remind him.</p> <p>Being reminded by Lu Tianyi, Wu Chengyue instantly recalled how he had fought the zombie lady on a roof at that time because she stole his zombie nucleus. As a result, he lost the fight, and rudely bit her thigh!</p> <p><em>‘Eh… wait a minute, something is wrong!’</em></p> <p>He suddenly gazed at Lu Tianyi and asked, “I don’t think it’s right. That woman was a commoner when she lived in our base. She was just a powerless pretty woman. Even though she has become a zombie, she couldn’t possibly become so powerful within such a short time. Not to mention the fact that she fought like a well-trained professional soldier, her personality and working style are different from before as well! Don’t you tell me that she had hidden all these before.”</p> <p><em>‘I don’t think they’re the same person. They shouldn’t be…’ </em>Wu Chengyue suddenly had a gleam of hope. He hoped that the zombie lady and Lu Tianyu were two different souls.</p>",
  "Chapter 391: Call It Even": "<p>Lu Tianyi looked at him with a slight pity, saying, “About that, Chief… Um, she didn’t deny that she is Lu Tianyu. In fact, you can just ask her about that… But um… your current relationship is a little… complicated…”</p> <p>At first, Lu Tianyu raped Wu Chengyue, and was killed. After she died, her death was blamed on the latter. Now, not only did she become a zombie, but also acted like a completely different person. She came back to the base and started a series of troubles, then had Wu Chengyue rape her. And after that, Wu Chengyue wanted to be responsible for her.</p> <p>Who should be responsible for whom?</p> <p>Alright, since they had both raped each other, they were even.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue thought for a moment, then said, “It is not right. Her personality now is drastically different from before. Turning into a zombie can’t possibly change her personality and habits, can it? Also, she was a…”</p> <p><em>‘She was a… well, okay, I think Viney said that her body was repaired by energy into the original state, which means her body was rebuilt, </em>‘ he thought.</p> <p>“We had the same doubts at first,” said Lu Tianyi, “But, we did fail to find her body back then. Besides, I was familiar with her face without makeup since before the apocalypse. I’ll always recognize that face of hers.”</p> <p>“So how dare she come back! Isn’t she afraid that I might recognize her?” Wu Chengyue laughed with a cold voice.</p> <p>“Chief, aren’t you even now?” said Kong Qingming, “She raped you before, and this time, you ate her. That’s good actually. Neither of you needs to be responsible for the other now. So, this has been settled. Let bygones be bygones. Um, Chief, you don’t need to marry his sister anymore, do you?”</p> <p>Even after learning that the zombie lady was Lu Tianyu, Wu Chengyue hadn’t regretted his decision, meaning that he didn’t give up on the idea of marrying her.</p> <p>Because he didn’t give up, he felt really uncomfortable now!</p> <p>He couldn’t have imagined that the zombie lady was actually that woman, because the two of them had nothing in common. They were so different, so even though he knew that her last name was Lu, he never thought that she might be that woman.</p> <p>So now, what he learned was beyond his expectation.</p> <p>Lu Tianyu seemed to have become another person after she turned into a zombie. Not only did she save Ling Ling a few times, but she had stopped doing evil deeds. She was even leading a group of people to build a new base. The old Lu Tianyu would never do something like that.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue suddenly recalled that when he saw her for the first time, she still looked like a normal zombie. Back then, she was prepared to send Ling Ling back to him, but he gave her a lightning strike without thinking and scared her away. She also took Ling Ling with her at that time.</p> <p>Before she died, she kidnapped Ling Ling so she could rape him. But after her death, she actually tried to send Ling Ling back to him.</p> <p>Was she stung by conscience? Or, did something wake her up when she died?</p> <p>Being reminded by Kong Qingming’s words, Lu Tianyi hurriedly asked the same question, “Yeah Chief, since you’ve already known who she really was, you won’t marry her anymore, will you? After all, everybody used to hate her.”</p> <p>But unexpectedly, Wu Chengyue looked at them and said, “Why don’t you want me to marry her? I didn’t say that I’ll give up. Even though I’ve now learned who she was, I should think about if she’ll turn back to her old self. I still plan to marry her and make her warm my bed. Also, this is perfect. She raped me last time, but I forced her this time. So, for what happened last time, she should be responsible for me. And for this time, I need to be responsible for her. So, to do that, I’ll just marry her.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi and Kong Qingming both looked at Wu Chengyue with surprise, as they didn’t expect him to still want to marry Lu Tianyu.</p> <p>“So how will you… face each other in the future?” Lu Tianyi asked that question uneasily.</p> <p>“What? Are you afraid that I might mistreat her?” Wu Chengyue laughed, “So that’s why you didn’t want me to dig out her background. I thought you were protecting her because you’re in love with her.”</p> <p>“Chief, you were overthinking,” Lu Tianyi responded with embarrassment.</p> <p>“Alright, I’ve already gotten what I wanted from you,” Wu Chengyue stood up and continued, “And I have told you about my purpose. I have to go out, as I still have work to do. You’re going to become my brother-in-law, isn’t that marvelous?”</p> <p>He patted Lu Tianyi on the shoulder, then picked up Ling Ling’s hand and headed outside. Behind him, the two young men were left stunned.</p> <p>After watching Wu Chengyue leave, Kong Qingming abruptly started talking, “We haven’t seen Miss. Lu for quite a while. Do you think… she has been hiding because she didn’t want Chief Wu to bother her?”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi had a very strange feeling when Wu Chengyue called him ‘brother-in-law’. Only after hearing Kong Qingming’s words did he come back to himself and say, “She didn’t show up? Maybe she went to the new base?”</p> <p>Kong Qingming shook his head and responded, “I’ve sent my people over there to check, but the information they brought back is a little weird. My people said that the new base seems to have been surrounded by a giant group of zombies, and that they couldn’t get in. Also, those zombies seem to be under control, because they won’t attack people randomly. I guess your sister has been controlling them. Perhaps, she has gone there already.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyi thought for a moment, then agreed, “I think so. She actually made zombies protect a base, that’s really weird.”</p> <p>Kong Qingming crossed his arms before his chest, then raised a hand to rub his chin while saying with confusion, “Didn’t Chief Wu have any familiar feeling when he had sex with your sister? It was the second time after all.”</p> <p>Lu Tianyu looked at him and responded, “Last time, she made it happen, and this time, I think she was forced. It must be different. Besides, Chief Wu didn’t think that she was Lu Tianyu, so he couldn’t possibly feel that they were the same person.”</p> <p>Kong Qingming nodded in agreement, “You’re right!”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue, who had just walked out of Lu Tianyi’s office, now felt that he needed to go back home and have some quiet time alone.</p> <p>He had actually raped that woman back… He raped her back…</p> <p>Also, it was actually her first time after her body was repaired. He had taken her virginity. Also, he wasn’t bound to be responsible to her, but his moral quality required him to.</p> <p>He had sex with her because he was entrapped and disabled from controlling himself. However, he still felt a little guilty afterward. But now, the guilty feeling was gone!</p> <p>This time, that woman wouldn’t be able to go anywhere! Even though she had turned into a zombie, she was now his zombie! Let alone the fact that she was now pregnant with his baby! How could he possibly let her go?</p>",
  "Chapter 392: Halfway Activated": "<p>In the space, Lin Qiao, who didn’t yet know that her identity was uncovered, spent two days to finally absorb all of Viney’s energy. After that, she found the lights around her turning brighter and brighter. As she thought, she was still at the bottom of the lake.</p> <p>As she regained the control of her own body, she immediately swam upward. While swimming, she suddenly saw a few locks of black hair drifting before her eyes. She was puzzled for a moment, then touched her head with a hand while swimming.</p> <p>Her hair were no longer spiky. She put her five fingers into her soft and long hair, then put the hair before her eyes.</p> <p>They had grown out! They were her hair!</p> <p>Seeing her new hair, Lin Qiao was instantly cheered up. She swam upward at a higher speed, and for some reason, she felt quite free in the lake. She didn’t need to spend too much effort, because she was able to swim fast very easily. Moreover, the energy in her lake gave her a comfortable feeling.</p> <p>Soon, she reached the water surface. She bobbed up and looked around, her eyes showing a faint confusion. After that, she swam toward the lakeside.</p> <p>At that time, Shen Yujen, who might have sensed her vibe, slowly walked out of a small space. She looked at Lin Qiao confusedly, also with puzzlement in her eyes.</p> <p>She clearly sensed that Lin Qiao’s vibe had changed, and so had her scent. Her scent had become sweet and tempting.</p> <p>However, her vibe had become even scarier than before. She seemed to be at a higher level now, and her vibe was mixed together with that of the vine plant in the lake. Another strange vibe was also contained in the mixture.</p> <p>The pressure which was given to Shen Yuzhen by Lin Qiao’s current vibe was stronger than what her old vibe gave her many times over.</p> <p>Shen Yujen watched Lin Qiao slowly come out of the water, then pick up the clothes on the chair to dress herself.</p> <p>She was surprised to see Lin Qiao’s long hair. She had only been in the lake for about ten days. How could her hair grow so long within such a short time? Was she able to grow her hair along with her level?</p> <p>Lin Qiao put the clothes on, then looked at her hands and touched her wet hair. After that, she touched her eyes.</p> <p>She didn’t notice that her eyes had turned to black and white from purely black. Her pupils were glowing green, which made her eyes look like the eyes of western people. However, she had an oriental face.</p> <p>She put the cosmetic contacts which she took out earlier back into her eye sockets. In fact, she didn’t need those anymore, but she had yet to figure that out.</p> <p>She noticed Shen Yujen’s gaze. There was quite a distance between them, but still, she felt the latter’s emotions.</p> <p>Shen Yuzhen was confused, scared, and obedient… Lin Qiao sensed her complicated feelings over the distance. She also sensed fear and desire for hiding from the woods, which was pretty far away.</p> <p>She walked to the couch area where Shen Yujen was, then asked her, “What’s wrong? What are you afraid of?” After saying that, she paused in shock.</p> <p>Her voice was fixed. It was no longer unpleasantly dry and hoarse, but silvery and sweet-sounding like a healthy female voice.</p> <p>Shen Yujen paused briefly as well upon hearing Lin Qiao’s voice, because she didn’t expect her voice to recover as well.</p> <p>She walked toward Lin Qiao and carefully looked at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was able to sense her thoughts. “Yeah, I think I have upgraded. And my body has been repaired, also activated. But, it’s only halfway activated. As for the other half, I might need to wait for a long while for it to be activated.” She touched her stomach while speaking. Viney had told her that the day Viney was born would be the day her body got activated completely.</p> <p>Viney also said that that would be the most dangerous part of the whole activation process.</p> <p>Shen Yujen looked at her and nodded.</p> <p>“I’m ready to go out and head to the new base. Are you still unwilling to go out to see Chen Yuting?” Lin Qiao asked her.</p> <p>Hearing her mention Chen Yuting, Shen Yujen shook her head, then opened her mouth and said something silently.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her with surprise, saying, “Eh? Have you thought it through? You should have figured it out long ago. If he cared about what you look like now, he wouldn’t have begged me to turn you into a zombie. Don’t you trust your relationship?”</p> <p>Shen Yujen slowly shook her head, then nodded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed and said, “I’ll bring you there then. I’ll let you out when I arrive.”</p> <p>Shen Yujen looked at her and nodded expectantly.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao flashed out of her space in her invisible state and came into the room where Lin Wenwen lived in Sea City Base. She sniffed around and found that the scents belonging to Lin Wenwen, Yuan Tianxing, and the others had almost faded. She only grasped some traces of their scents which were left there days ago.</p> <p>However, she sensed the scents of Du Yuanxing and two soldiers from the room across the hall. Only the three of them were left here.</p> <p>Based on those faint, lingering scents in that room, Lin Qiao figured that Yuan Tianxing and the others had left Sea City Base for the new base which was located in the Upper City District in Hangzhou.</p> <p>She glanced at the door and the windows, and found that they were all locked. The outside was bright, seeming to be afternoon time.</p> <p>She didn’t open the door, but headed to the door of the balcony.</p> <p>Then, she realized that she was now able to do anything in her invisible state except for using her superpower. She could even kill a person with her claws while staying invisible. So now, she could deliver perfect sneak attacks or assassinations.</p> <p>She gently unlocked the door and pushed it open, then spent a moment sensing the surrounding vibes. She found that quite a few vibes were hiding around the room for some unknown reason. The owners of those vibes should have been watching this room for the whole time.</p> <p>Therefore, she pushed the door open very slowly, as if the door was opened by a breeze. No one was able to see her anyway.</p> <p>After coming out, she closed the door form the outside, then leaped out of the balcony. In the next moment, she was on the roof of another building.</p> <p>She had no shadow, not even when she stood under the sunlight. That had been making her feel as if she was a traceless ghost. Right now, she still didn’t have a shadow even under the bright daylight!</p> <p>She thought that her special skills might be disabled after she turned back into a human being. But to her surprise, her skills weren’t affected at all.</p> <p>She landed on a tree, then popped her translucent black nails and scratched a branch.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>Following the slight noise, the branch broke.</p> <p>She turned and left that tree, hopping onto a utility pole before leaping toward an administration building. After that, she walked to the building from a corner.</p> <p>In the crowded first floor hall, no one discovered her presence. Anyway, she didn’t linger there, but headed straight to the Mission Hall.</p> <p>Soon, she made a tour in the Misson Hall and spent a while watching Du Yuanxing and the others doing the recruitment work. As nothing abnormal was found, she turned and left toward an area where nobody was present.</p> <p>Lin Qiao entered an old building beside the administration building. It was a small, three-storeyed building, and the gate before the stairs wasn’t locked. She took the stairs to the third floor, which had a hallway in the middle with rooms on both sides.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked into the hallway, then paused abruptly. A man was standing in front of her before a door, and banging on it loudly.</p> <p><em>‘Something is happening here </em>!’ she thought.</p> <p>She walked over and stood at two meters behind that man to observe him.</p> <p>He was a superpowered man, only at level-four, wearing a leisure suit. The suit was nicely styled, simple, and elegant, perfectly highlighting the man’s tall and slim body.</p> <p>However, the suit looked very old.</p> <p>Standing two meters away from them, Lin Qiao had been sensing a strong foul smell, maybe because she was a zombie with a very sensitive sense of smell.</p> <p>The man looked in his thirties and was not ugly, but not handsome either. He was just an average-looking man.</p> <p>After banging the door for a few times and getting no response at all, he put a hand into his pocket and took out a key. After that, he inserted the key into the keyhole and twisted it.</p> <p>Crack!</p> <p>Following a slight noise, the door was opened by him.</p> <p>“Huang Xiaoqing, I know you’re home. I have a way to get in even though you didn’t open the door for me. You see, I’m coming in now. Are you still gonna hide?” The man didn’t walk in immediately after opening the door, but stood at the door and widely opened it. He talked with a proud grin, his eyes glowing with a light of excitement.</p> <p>However, the grin on his face froze when he looked inside the room.</p> <p>Lin Qiao, who was behind him, sensed the change of his emotion and walked up with curiosity. She looked into the room, then showed a knowing look in her eyes.</p> <p>No wonder that man froze. In the room, a woman was sitting on the couch with another man. They had their arms around each other, and were both looking at the man at the door scornfully.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao didn’t pay attention to those people, but soon turned her eyes to the man who was tied up, sitting in a corner.</p> <p>That man’s head was slightly lowered. He sat there silently, as if he didn’t even exist. Therefore, the man at the door didn’t notice him.</p> <p>The woman on the couch looked at the man at the door displeasedly and said, “What are you doing here? I’ve told you to not come to me anymore. Yet you sneakily made a copy of my key. Are you going to do something bad?”</p> <p>The man at the door had his expression changed immediately. He angrily walked into the room with big steps and pointed at the man who was sitting beside the woman as he asked, “Who is him? You found a boy-toy so quickly? Good for you!”</p> <p>While speaking, he began sneering.</p> <p>The woman’s face reddened as she abruptly stood up and yelled at that man, “What are you talking about! He’s not a boy-toy! You think I’d agree to be together with a man like you? In your dream! There are lots of men in this base who’re more capable than you!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao followed that man into the room and looked at the woman. She found that even though the woman was a commoner, her clothes were pretty new, and of good quality at that.</p> <p>She then glanced at the room. The room was fully furnished by almost new furniture pieces. Not too many old things were seen.</p> <p>Clearly, except for this woman, a quite capable man also lived in this place. Otherwise, a female commoner could never be able to live in a building like this and have so many furniture pieces.</p> <p>This could be considered a rather good place in the post-apocalyptic world.</p> <p>That long-haired woman was quite pretty. She wasn’t stunningly beautiful, but did look young and comely. However, Lin Qiao didn’t like the vibe that she was giving.</p> <p>She was about twenty-seven or eight years old, wearing a low-cut top, a tight skirt, and a pair of seven-centimeters heels, exposing her obvious cleavage and a pair of slightly fat legs.</p> <p>In the post-apocalyptic world, dressing like this would make a woman look exactly like a prostitute.</p> <p>Lin Qiao disliked these sexy kind of clothes the most. She believed that women shouldn’t wear these unless they wanted to make some men commit certain crimes.</p> <p>Judging by the current situation, the relationships between that woman and those men seemed to be a little complicated. <em>‘It should be like this </em>,’ thought Lin Qiao.</p> <p>The man who was sitting on the couch was a level-five superpowered man. He wasn’t handsome either, but looked slightly younger and better than the man who just came in.</p> <p>He was wearing a clean pair of jeans and a shirt, lazily leaning against the back of the couch.</p> <p>“Oi, watch your language. From this moment on, Huang Xiaoqing is my woman. Her ex-boyfriend has given her to me. Who are you?”</p> <p>While speaking, the man in a shirt pointed at the man in the corner, who had been staying motionless with his head lowered. Only after that did the man in an old suit notice the third man in this room.</p> <p>With both surprise and doubts, he observed the man in the corner while asking, “Are you… Xie Dong?”</p> <p>The man in the corner didn’t reply, neither did he make any move. He just kept sitting there.</p> <p>The man in old suit stared at him for a few seconds, then turned to the man on the couch and the woman who was standing in front of him. At last, he suddenly turned to leave.</p> <p>“Wait! Leave the key of my apartment!” Huang Xiaoqing yelled at him.</p> <p>The man swung an arm back and threw the key to the floor, then walked away quickly, leaving the door wide open.</p> <p>“He sneakily made a copy of my key! Thankfully, he came at daytime. If he showed up at night, I’d be in a trouble!” Huang Xiaoqing angrily walked to the door and closed it with while complaining.</p> <p>On her way back to the couch, she bent over to pick up the key from the floor. While doing that, her round hip was raised high enough to make the man on the couch have his blood boil.</p> <p>The man stared at her hip and swallowed his saliva. As the woman walked back to his side, he couldn’t help but put an arm around her waist and make her sit straight on his lap.</p> <p>Meanwhile, his hands were already all over her.</p> <p>“Aw, don’t do this. There’s someone else in this room!” The woman chuckled and said. Despite her words, she didn’t make any move to resist.</p> <p>The man paused briefly, then turned to Xie Dong who was sitting in the corner and said scornfully, “So what? Can’t we just let him watch a free show? Eh? Come here and let me kiss you.”</p> <p>After saying that, he put his mouth to that woman’s neck and started kissing her.</p> <p>The woman tried to dodge while chuckling and saying, “What should we do now? Should we kick him out? But, this apartment is registered under his name. If he crosses my name, I won’t be able to live here anymore.”</p> <p>The man responded carelessly while touching the woman’s body, “If you want, I can send him to the security department and tell the guys over there that he’s one of Yang Chao’s people. After that, he won’t be able to come out alive.”</p>",

  "Chapter 394: Loved the Wrong Person": "<p>Hearing that man say that he could send Xie Dong to the security department, the woman looked at him and asked confusedly, “Eh? Really? But he has nothing to do with Yang Chao, does he?”</p> <p>“What are you worrying about? I know people in that department. So, he’ll be Yang Chao’s man as long as I say so. Do you understand?” said the man.</p> <p>The woman now understood his meaning, and spoke delightfully, “Really! Then let’s send him there now. I’m really tired of seeing him. I thought he wouldn’t come back this time. He’s been out for so a couple of months. I thought he died out there… But, he came back.”</p> <p>While speaking, she turned to Xie Dong, her face filled with dislike.</p> <p>Lin Qiao crossed her arms and watched for a while, figuring out what was going on.</p> <p>As she was rather close to the man and the woman, she could clearly sense their thoughts. She was now able to sense people’s thought without touching them. That should be a benefit of her newest upgrade.</p> <p>That woman had actually been using Xie Dong as a stepping stone. She didn’t care about him at all, but had been making use of his love for her. While living together with Xie Dong, she tried her best to get the most out of him, and make him earn more for her.</p> <p>Xie Dong gave her the best he had while they lived together for three years. Whatever that woman wanted, he would try to get it for her.</p> <p>He didn’t expect that relationship to end this way. So now, he sat in the corner downheartedly. He didn’t want to watch the woman whom he loved seducing another man right in front of him. Also, he now learned that she was with more than just one man.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Huang Xiaoqing disdainfully, then turned to Xie Dong. As the latter made no response to the conversation between those two, she couldn’t help but walk to him.</p> <p><em>‘They’re going to put you in jail. How much longer are you going to stay like this?’</em>She kicked him and said in her head.</p> <p>Xie Dong immediately raised his head and looked around but saw no one other than the two who made him clench his teeth. At that moment, the man and the woman on the couch were holding each other and kissing.</p> <p>That scene made Xie Dong close his eyes instantly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao kicked him again disappointedly.</p> <p>This time, Xie Dong understood that he didn’t have an illusion earlier. He opened his eyes and turned to where Lin Qiao was with questions in his eyes. Lin Qiao reached out a hand and dragged him into her space.</p> <p>The two people in the apartment who had already started taking off their clothes didn’t notice that Xie Dong was suddenly gone.</p> <p>“You just sat there quietly?” Lin Qiao glared at him and yelled once they were in her space.</p> <p>Seeing her, Xie Dong felt as if he had seen a savior. He looked at her with confusion, not knowing what he should do.</p> <p>Lin Qiao left him in the base to secretly protect Lin Wenwen, and he did what she asked. However, Lin Wenwen had stayed in her building without coming out even once.</p> <p>Later on, she finally came out, but she left the building to leave the base with Yuan Tianxing and the others.</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t leave the base because he was brought into the base by Lin Qiao in her space earlier on. Last time, he had signed before leaving the base. So, if he left with Lin Wenwen and the others, he would have to explain to the people who worked at the entrance about why he was already back in the base with no record of entering.</p> <p>The second reason why he didn’t leave was that he saw a woman.</p> <p>He was going to take a glance at her from far away to know if she was living a good life or not. However, he found out that after he was gone, the woman was openly with other men. He was quite sad upon finding that.</p> <p>What made him even sadder was that the woman didn’t love him at all. She only used his love to get the things that she wanted. In fact, she had been with other men behind his back since long ago.</p> <p>When he muddleheadedly followed her and that man back to this building, the woman wouldn’t let him come back to his own home.</p> <p>He built this home bit by bit with zombie nuclei, by risking his life to kill zombies out there. When he was having a mental collapse, the man beside the woman suddenly made a move and brought him under control.</p> <p>He had weakened largely after turning into a zombie and was distracted. So, that man easily gained the upper hand over him.</p> <p>Lin Qiao rolled her eyes toward him and said, “Haven’t you thought about kicking them out? That is your home, and everything in that apartment belongs to you. Even if you have given all those things to that woman, she can’t have them unless she loves you.”</p> <p>Xie Dong gazed at her with a very heavy heart.</p> <p>“If you don’t want to stay in this place anymore, you should at least go out and end it with that woman. Don’t continue wasting your love on that kind of a woman,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Xie Dong dropped his eyelids and nodded in response.</p> <p>“I’ll get that man in here. You go out to deal with that woman yourself,” Lin Qiao continued. After saying that, she flashed out and came back in with a panicking man within two seconds.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave that man a slap to knock him out, then threw him into the grass nearby. After that, she went out of her space with Xie Dong.</p> <p>Once out, they saw Huang Xiaoqing looking around the room for that man in alarm while shouting, “Tianfei? Huang Tianfei?”</p> <p>At that moment, she saw Xie Dong suddenly show up before her, untied.</p> <p>She paused in shock. After spending a few seconds staring at Xie Dong and processing what she had seen, she suddenly burst in yells, “Xie Dong, did you take him away? Where is Huang Tianfei?”</p> <p>Xie Dong only looked at him quietly; he wasn’t able to talk after all.</p> <p>Seeing him stay silent, Huang Xiaoqing cursed angrily, “Look at you! You’re such a coward. What can you do? If you couldn’t get me a place to leave and get me food to eat, I’d never spend my life with a man like you!”</p> <p><em>‘That’s the excuse you used when you cheated on me, right?’</em></p> <p>Looking at her, Xie Dong suddenly understood that he had wasted the past few years on this woman. Why on earth did he risk his life to get such a good life for this woman?</p> <p>Huang Xiaoqing said to him coldly, “You better not do anything to Huang Tianfei. He has people in the security department. If anything happens to him, you’ll be in troubles. Don’t drag me into troubles too. Bring him back now!”</p> <p>Xie Dong silently stared at her for a few seconds, then suddenly raised a hand.</p> <p>Clap!</p> <p>A loud slap landed on Huang Xiaoqing’s face and turned her face to the other side.</p> <p>“You… How dare you hit me!” Huang Xiaoqing popped her large eyes in disbelief and murmured while turning back to glare at Xie Dong. “You a*shole! You actually hit me!” she screamed.</p> <p>Xie Dong understood why she reacted so strongly. Before, she never talked gently to him, while he carefully fawned on her the whole time. She always yelled at him and sometimes even cursed him.</p> <p>Based on Xie Dong’s old attitude, Huang Xiaoqing never thought that he would hit her.</p>",
  "Chapter 395: Lin Qiao Leaves Sea City": "<p>Lin Qiao couldn’t bear watching that, so she walked up and knocked the woman out with a slap.</p> <p>After that, she showed her face and said to Xie Dong, “Pack your things. Nothing here is worthy for you to be reluctant to leave. Let’s go to the new base and start over.”</p> <p>Xie Dong glanced at her, then nodded before turning and walking into the bedroom.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood by that woman’s side, then entered her space to bring out the guy named Huang Tianfei. After that, she squatted beside the two fainted people and rubbed her chin while thinking for a while.</p> <p>She raised her head to look around, then fixed her eyes on the old curtains. Next, she stood up and walked to the windows, then dragged the curtains off.</p> <p>She tore the curtains into pieces, then tied the two people up. At last, she dragged both of them to the door, opened it, and threw them out.</p> <p>As she turned around and prepared to walk back in, she paused abruptly, then looked back at the two while blinking. Suddenly, her lips curved in a wicked smile. She reached out a hand, spread her fingers out, and slightly clenched them toward the two.</p> <p>Along with a slight cloth-tearing noise, all the clothes of the two people who were lying on the ground turned into pieces and fell off their bodies.</p> <p>They hadn’t woken up yet, so some cloth pieces were still on them. Once they woke up and tried to move, they would both be stark naked.</p> <p>After doing that, Lin Qiao quickly went back into the apartment.</p> <p>She knew that many people lived in this building, so those two people would soon be seen.</p> <p>At that moment, Xie Dong walked out with a bag. He stood beside Lin Qiao and looked at her without noticing what she just did. Lin Qiao shut the door after he walked out.</p> <p>“Are you done packing? If you’re done, we’ll leave,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Xie Dong nodded at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao brought him into her space, then came out in the invisible state, opened the door, and walked out. She went straight downstairs and headed outside, soon reaching the fence wall. She looked around for a moment, and then moved to a staircase.</p> <p>There were stairs leading to the top of the fence wall, as lookout posts were set up there.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took the stairs up, then directly leaped off the eight-meter-tall fence wall.</p> <p>Within two-hundred meters from the fence wall on the inside and five-hundred meters on the outside, the area was totally empty, with no buildings or trees. That area was kept empty to ensure a wide and clear view for the sentries. For that purpose, all the buildings around the fence wall had been torn down when the base was built.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao needed to cover a distance on foot after leaping off the fence wall.</p> <p>When she jumped down from the wall, she forgot about the fact that she now had a baby in her belly. So, as she landed on the ground and made a few steps, she froze shortly.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? I was running about just now. Is Viney fine?’</em></p> <p>As she was not feeling any discomfort, Lin Qiao was slightly relieved.</p> <p>At that moment, Viney seemed to have sensed her thoughts, as her voice was heard from the bottom of Lin Qiao’s heart.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, Mama, Viney is fine… But Mama, please don’t fight with others. If you have to, don’t fight too intensely…’</em></p> <p><em>‘Do you mean that I can’t do close combat against others now? </em>‘ Lin Qiao asked.</p> <p><em>‘No, you cant </em>,’ said Viney.</p> <p><em>‘Alright then, I get it. Using my powers should be fine, right? </em>‘ said Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, you can use your powers as much as you want, as long as you don’t consume them up,’ </em>Viney replied.</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao sighed with relief and then kept walking.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Inside her space, Xie Dong was sitting on a couch, looking a little dull and confused. Shen Yujen walked out of a small space. She had sensed that Xie Dong was a zombie like her, and wasn’t at a higher level than her.</p> <p>She walked to the other side of the couch and sat down, then curiously looked at Xie Dong’s face. She found that as same as her face, his face showed no zombie features either. If she didn’t sense his zombie scent, she might not be able to recognize him as a zombie.</p> <p>Noticing that a person had suddenly shown up beside him, Xie Dong came back to his senses and raised his head to look at Shen Yujen.</p> <p><em>‘Eh?’</em></p> <p>The two of them wore the same expression. Xie Dong wasn’t surprised, because he was used to seeing weird zombies around Lin Qiao. Even he himself was one of them.</p> <p>…</p> <p>On the outside, Lin Qiao walked through the empty area and found a place where nobody was present, then brought out a car of her space. After that, she sat into the driver’s seat and started the car, then began driving toward Hangzhou.</p> <p>Two hours later, she arrived at the Upper City District. From a long distance away, she saw a large crowd of zombies wandering on the street. Only until Lin Qiao’s vehicle approached did those zombies stop moving and turn toward her simultaneously.</p> <p>Lin Qiao parked the car three meters away from then, then stuck her head out to look around.</p> <p>Bang! A loud noise was heard as a heavy thing fell on the roof of her car.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned and glanced at the car roof, then said calmly, “Please don’t jump onto my car next time. Look, you’ve already dented my car. Are you gonna pay for that?”</p> <p>After saying that, she drew her head back into the car. At that moment, the zombie crowd before her suddenly began moving toward both sides as if they were stimulated by something.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a figure leaped down from the car roof. That was the crack-mouthed zombie boy.</p> <p>Zombie number four, who looked like a disabled kid as his chin was wrapped up in a bandage,, walked to Lin Qiao’s car window and popped his black eyes to observe Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw the confused look on his face and understood that he might not understand the change of her vibe. Her original zombie vibe still remained, even though she hadn’t released it entirely.</p> <p>So now, zombie number four must be wondering why her vibe was different again, and why he couldn’t tell which exact part of her vibe had changed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment, then said to him, “Give me your cup.”</p> <p>Hearing her mention his cup, the zombie boy immediately forgot about other things. He hurriedly pulled his backpack to his chest and opened it to take out a cup from it before handing it to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao promised to provide each of them with a cup of lake water every day. However, they hadn’t been drinking any of the water that Lin Qiao gave since they got here. So, they all felt quite agitated recently.</p> <p>After drinking the lake water for a few days, they had gradually lost their appetite for living human beings.</p> <p>A canteen appeared in Lin Qiao’s hand as she shook that hand. After that, she filled the zombie boy’s cup with lake water. As soon as his cup was filled, the zombie boy impatiently ripped off the bandage on his mouth, exposing his scary-looking bloody mouth, then poured the water in.</p> <p><em>‘Why do I feel that this kid is drinking some kind of life-saving drug? </em>‘ thought Lin Qiao.</p>",
  "Chapter 396: The Hair Are Real": "<p>The zombie boy quickly emptied his cup, then handed it to Lin Qiao again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao directly put the stainless kettle in his hand and said, “Alright, take it, take it… Drink slowly! Don’t forget to give it back to me tomorrow.”</p> <p>The zombie boy took over the kettle and gave an obvious pause. After hearing what Lin Qiao said, he quickly nodded at her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao waved at him and said, “Go… Guard this area well! Don’t let strangers come in.”</p> <p>She prepared to tell the zombie boy to move aside and then drive into the site of the new base.</p> <p>After hearing her words, the zombie boy suddenly thought of something and gave her a roar.</p> <p>“Roar!” ‘Some people came recently…’</p> <p>Lin Qiao paused while staring the car, then turned to the zombie boy and asked, “Who were they?”</p> <p>“Roar…” ‘I don’t know. I didn’t let them in. They didn’t seem to want to fight, so I let them leave.’</p> <p>Lin Qiao put her elbow on the car window and scratched her chin while thinking.</p> <p>Who were those people? They might be from a zombie-hunting squad. However, this place was a zombie city, which was filled with zombies. A normal zombie-hunting squad wouldn’t visit this place, as it was dangerous and far.</p> <p>“Roar, roar…” ‘They wandered around at first. I don’t know what they were doing.’ Said the zombie boy.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Alright, I get it.”</p> <p>The zombie boy held the kettle and leaped onto a tree nearby, then disappeared into the leaves without a trace. Meanwhile, Lin Qiao drove the car into the new base site.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao drove in, a zombie roar was heard. Following that, the zombies which had run away came back out from the surrounding allies, crowding together again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao drove for another mile, then arrived at the road before Victoria Hotel.</p> <p>The creatures in the hotel had heard the noise of Lin Qiao’s car before she arrived at the hotel. So soon enough, some figures appeared beside her car, but didn’t stop her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was driving an armed vehicle which belonged to Yang Jianhua. She was able to look outside through the windshield, but people on the outside couldn’t look inside.</p> <p>Fortunately, the people in the hotel were quite familiar with those armed vehicles that Lin Qiao stole from Yang Jianhua. Seeing that vehicle, they guessed that Lin Qiao was inside.</p> <p>Lin Qiao parked the car before the hotel, then opened the door and got out. A few people walked out from the lobby, looking at her happily.</p> <p>“Qiaoqiao!” A white figure jumped down toward her from the roof, then landed gently on the ground with her silk-like long twin-tails fluttering in the air. Lin Qiao didn’t dodge Qiu Lili’s huge hug and just stood there, letting the latter pounce on her and put her arms around her.</p> <p>“Roar!” An unhappy roar was heard from the roof.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised her head and found Mengmeng looking at her with discontentment.</p> <p>“Qiaoqiao, you’re so slow! What took you so long?” After giving Lin Qiao a hug, Qiu Lili freed her, then held one of her arms and asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her confusedly and said, “Why didn’t I realize earlier that you like to stay around me so much? It has only been about ten days. That’s not a long time, is it?”</p> <p>“Hm,” Qiu Lili pouted to complain, “This place is no fun without you.” After that, she curiously looked at Lin Qiao’s hair and said, “Eh? Your hair grew long within just ten days, and you’ve upgraded again! Your vibe has also changed.”</p> <p>After saying that, she put her face near one side of Lin Qiao’s neck to sniff at her, then narrowed her eyes and said intoxicatedly, “Em, you smell so nice!”</p> <p>Qiu Lili had been around Lin Qiao for long, so she was used to the improving rate of the latter’s power and the quick changes of her body. However, the others all looked at Lin Qiao’s hair with surprise.</p> <p>“Eh? Where did you find this wig? It’s well-made, looking exactly like real hair!” Liu Jun walked out of the hotel and stood behind Cheng Wangxue as she asked with curiosity.</p> <p>The others also wanted to ask the same question.</p> <p>“Wig? No, these are real hair,” Qiu Lili said while pulling Lin Qiao’s hair.</p> <p>The others all wore a shocked face when they heard that. “Eh? Real hair? Not a wig? How can it be possible? It has only been ten days! Were you injected with a hair-growing hormone or something?” said someone.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked into the gate of the hotel, then responded while heading toward the lobby, “I’m not injected with any hormone. I just repaired my body.”</p> <p>While speaking, she unwittingly touched her belly.</p> <p>“You upgraded again! Honestly, are you already at level-six… or even seven?” Lin Feng walked over and asked her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him and laughed, “About that… Lili, what do you think?”</p> <p>She suddenly threw the question to Qiu Lili, who was at the highest level among all who were on the scene.</p> <p>Qiu Lili was fiddling with her own hair. Hearing Lin Qiao’s voice, she looked at her from head to toe, then responded, “Well in fact, I can’t sense your level either. But, your vibe is already suppressing mine. Are you at a higher level than I am already?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “Actually, my level isn’t as high as yours. I’m not sure about my current power yet. I’ll have to give it a try to find out.”</p> <p>“You’ve been upgrading crazily fast as if you’re cheating,” said Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled and said, “I am cheating indeed. If I didn’t cheat, would you be able to talk?”</p> <p>She had Viney, who had been helping her cheat.</p> <p>She walked to a couch, then abruptly turned to look at Chen Yuting and said, “Your wife is ready to come out. Wait a second!”</p> <p>After saying that, she suddenly disappeared in front of everyone else.</p> <p>Hearing that, Chen Yuting became a little excited. He popped his eyes and stared at where Lin Qiao disappeared.</p> <p>“See, I told you that she’ll be fine. Maybe she still remembers you,” said Lin Feng to him.</p> <p>The others all knew what had his wife been though. They wanted to comfort him at that moment, but were worried that they might end up saying the wrong words.</p> <p>In less than two seconds, Lin Qiao showed up with another female.</p> <p>“Jen!” Chen Yuting shouted out loud at the sight of Shen Yujen, who was standing beside Lin Qiao, looking perfectly unharmed.</p> <p>After that, he couldn’t help but quickly walk up to her, holding her hands as he asked, “Jen, do you… know who I am?”</p> <p>Shen Yujen looked at the others, then nodded at Chen Yuting.</p> <p>“Great! You remember me!” Chen Yuting held her in his arms.</p> <p>Shen Yujen was able to sense his emotions, but could do nothing except hold him silently.</p> <p>She wasn’t able to cry or talk.</p> <p>Some of the others were pretty jealous of the two love birds. “Your Jen is now… a…” said one of them.</p> <p>They were quite curious about Shen Yujen’s current condition, especially because she looked normal. Her eyes weren’t black, and no part of her body seemed to have changed.</p> <p>Chen Yuting paused for a second, then abruptly loosened his embrace and looked at her face.</p> <p>“Don’t worry! She has indeed turned into a zombie, but she still has her memories. She remembers what happened before,” said Lin Qiao.</p>",
  "Chapter 397: I Can See Through You": "<p>The others immediately turned to look at Lin Qiao with surprise, and then began observing Shen Yujen with disbelief.</p> <p>Shen Yujen looked no different from a normal human being except for her slightly pale skin. Her face was clean, her eyes were clear, and her lips were clean as well.</p> <p>“Eh, your eyes…” Lin Wenwen, who stood beside her, found that a layer of something in Shen Yujen’s eyes seemed to be missing.</p> <p>Shen Yujen nodded at her, then sniffed at Chen Yuting and gently pushed him away.</p> <p>“Jen?” Chen Yuting didn’t understand why she did that.</p> <p>Shen Yujen ran to behind Lin Qiao after pushing Chen Yuting away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao explained for her, “She doesn’t have full control of her appetite yet, so for now, she can’t stay with you or other human beings for long.”</p> <p>She meant that the scents of human beings could affect her and make her lose control.</p> <p>Chen Yuting spent a few seconds gazing at Shen Yujen’s face, then turned to Lin Qiao and asked anxiously, “What… what should we do then? Will my Jen stay like this? Can’t she be like you?”</p> <p>“She needs to upgrade as quickly as possible. When her body is filled with energy, the scents of blood and flesh will become less attractive to her,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“So… how can we help Jen upgrade as quickly as possible?” asked Chen Yuting.</p> <p>Lin Qiao grinned at him and said, “That’s easy. You go and find me a good number of zombie nuclei at level two or three.”</p> <p>Some of the others grabbed seats, and some who had nowhere to sit stood around Lin Qiao while listening to her.</p> <p>Chen Yuting looked at her and asked with surprise, “Zombie nuclei? So simple?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave him a glance with a mysterious smile, saying, “Your job is surely simple. I’ll be doing all the difficult work. From now on, your Jen is my girl… Ah, I mean, my zombie. She’ll be under my command, working for me.”</p> <p>Chen Yuting looked at Shen Yujen, and the latter nodded at him.</p> <p>“But my Jen… She doesn’t really have any skills except for doing housework…” said Chen Yuting with concern.</p> <p>“Are you silly?” said Lin Qiao, “She’s different now! Also, I’ll train her. Don’t you worry about that.”</p> <p>After saying that, she abruptly turned to Lin Wenwen and said with confusion, “Your vibe has changed a little. Have you been exercising lately?”</p> <p>She observed Lin Wenwen while speaking. Her roughly cut hair had been fixed by someone, looking clean and neat and pretty.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed that Lin Wenwen’s vibe was much stronger than in Sea City Base. As a space-power possessor who was always under protection, Lin Wenwen had a weak vibe the whole time. But now, that vibe of hers had grown a lot stronger.</p> <p>Lin Qiao also sensed a great improvement of the other’s body condition. That improvement might be minor for the others, but for Lin Wenwen herself, it meant something.</p> <p>It seemed that she had really made up her mind when cutting her hair.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen paused for a second, then looked at her and said, “Eh? Miss. Lu, have you noticed it? But I think I didn’t feel any change.”</p> <p>She had only been exercising for about ten days. By now, she was able to keep running for half an hour. However, she hadn’t felt any obvious changes yet.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin smiled at Lin Qiao, “Maybe she’s crazy. She cut her own hair earlier, and now she asked Qingying to jog with her every night and morning. Each day, she jogged for a longer time than the previous day.”</p> <p>All the other members of Lin Family had noticed Lin Wenwen’s crazy actions. They didn’t say much about that, but they all felt delighted.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “The others can’t see the changes in your body, but I can. I can see through your body, spot the changes in your cells, blood, and other parts, as well as your energy. I can see all of your energies.”</p> <p>While speaking, she looked around and scanned everyone else with her eyes.</p> <p>Those people didn’t know what to say. They all felt chilly from their hearts, but they didn’t know why.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen looked at her in shock, saying, “Your power is amazing!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked back at Lin Wenwen with surprise and said, “I didn’t expect you to keep exercising for so many days.”</p> <p>She knew that Lin Wenwen never liked sports since she was little. She would be willing to do anything other than sports.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen smiled and said, “I’ve made my decision, and I’ll always keep my words. Perhaps… you know that.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was stunned. The smile on her face faded as she stared at Lin Wenwen silently.</p> <p>What stunned her wasn’t Lin Wenwen’s words, but her thoughts. Lin Wenwen was about five meters away from her, but she still sensed her thoughts.</p> <p>They gazed at each other with silence in the next few seconds, then the atmosphere suddenly turned weird.</p> <p>The others looked at Lin Qiao, then turned to Lin Wenwen with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao blinked, then abruptly gave a meaningful grin and said, “Do you know what you are thinking right now? Do you really believe it?”</p> <p>This time, Lin Wenwen was the one stunned. She confusedly looked at Lin Qiao and asked, “No way! Can you even read my mind?”</p> <p>“You’ve been seeing me as someone who had an accident, haven’t you? When did you find out?” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>The look on Lin Wenwen’s face suddenly changed as she pointed at Lin Qiao and asked, “You… you admitted!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shrugged and stayed silent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the others looked at both of them bewilderedly. No one could understand their conversation. As Lin Wenwen became excited, they got even more confused.</p> <p>However, Mrs. Lin, Liu Jun, and Qiu Lili seemed to have guessed something. They had been looking at the two quietly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Lin Wenwen and said, “It’s not strange that you have such a thought, but you actually believed it. How weird!”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen popped her eyes and said in amazement, “You…”</p> <p>“Alright! Wenwen, let’s continue this conversation later in my room. Now, I want to know the location of the fence wall,” Lin Qiao interrupted her.</p> <p>While speaking, she turned to Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing. “Also, I want to ask you for a small favor,” she continued to Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing didn’t think that she would suddenly change the topic and talk to him, as he and everybody else were still curious about what she and Lin Wenwen were talking about.</p> <p>“Eh… favor? What favor?”</p> <p>“I want you to separate a house from the earth in whole. Can you do that?” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“A house? A building?” asked Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Not a large building, just a small, three-story one. Can you do that?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and responded, “I can do that.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao smiled at him and said, “Thank you!”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing didn’t understand why Lin Qiao wanted him to separate a small building from the earth, but he still nodded and replied, “You’re welcome!”</p>",
  "Chapter 398: She Admitted That She Is Her": "<p>Lin Qiao looked at the others and said, “Alright! Now, can I take a look at your progress?”</p> <p>Lin Feng spread a map on a table. It was clearly a map of this area, with some marks on it. Lin Qiao, Yuan Tianxing, Lin Feng, Chen Yuting, and the others all gathered around the table.</p> <p>Lin Feng pointed at a triangle mark and said, “This is our hotel, and this area is our construction site. A few old buildings have been torn down. All the bricks from those buildings will be used to build the fence wall. All the useful things from those buildings have been moved here, and the useless things were either torn apart or burned.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at that area on the map. A river existed in that area, and it should be connected with the old sewerage system. If the new base was built along with the river, the river would surround the base and serve as a protection.</p> <p>“Is the fence wall behind the river?” she asked.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and said, “Yes. I’ve checked the depth of this river. The deepest area in the middle was about four meters deep. Lots of garbage had accumulated at the bottom of the lake, along with a thick layer of mud. If people want to get down into the river, they have to have water-power, or it’ll be very dangerous.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded as she carefully checked all the marks on the map. The center of the new base was circled up on the map by Yuan Tianxing with a red line, having an area of about five or six acres.</p> <p>Lin Feng suddenly thought of something. “We’re preparing to install the solar equipment that you collected earlier in this hotel. What do you think?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and responded, “I’m fine with it. Have you found someone who knows how to install it?”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing said, “Yes. We’ve been waiting for the equipment.”</p> <p>“Alright, I’ll go up to the roof later on to take the solar equipment out of my space, and you can bring your people up there,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Feng nodded in response.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing and the others pointed at the map as they talked about the construction of the fence wall. Lin Wenwen and the other ladies didn’t fully understand what they said, as they didn’t take part in the construction work.</p> <p>At that time, Mrs. Lin quietly walked to Lin Wenwen and poked her. The latter turned around and saw her mother wave at her before walking toward the stairs.</p> <p>Qiu Lili and Liu Jun didn’t want to hear about the construction work, so after staying around Lin Qiao for a short while, they got bored and sneaked away.</p> <p>As same as Liu Jun, Cheng Wangxue was with a child. To prevent the child from disturbing Lin Feng and the others, she left early with her daughter as well.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen glanced back at Long Qingying. She didn’t know what Mrs. Lin was going to say to her, but still followed behind her mother.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?” In the corner behind the stairs, Lin Wenwen asked Mrs. Lin. The latter glanced at Lin Qiao and the others who were still talking about work, then reached out a hand to drag Lin Wenwen further into the corner.</p> <p>She looked at Lin Wenwen and asked, “The words you said earlier, what did they mean?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen didn’t understand her meaning immediately. “Words? What words?” she asked.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin gave her a calm glance and said, “The weird conversation that happened between you and Miss. Lu just now. She said that she knew what you were thinking about, and that you’ve been seeing her as someone who had an accident. And then, you said that she admitted something… Tell me, have you identified her?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen gazed at her mother, saying, “Mom… You’re not… thinking what I’m thinking, are you?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin sighed and said, “As I thought, you’ve guessed it.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen looked at Mrs. Lin’s face with surprise and asked, “Mom, had you figured it out long ago? How did you know?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin gave her another glance, saying, “I’m your Mom. Don’t I know you kids? Even you suspect her, so why can’t I discover the strange things about her?”</p> <p>She turned to Lin Qiao and continued, “I recognized her handwriting when she first showed up. Didn’t you notice that too? I’ve just been guessing. I can’t say for sure, as such a thing is too… unbelievable.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen looked at Mrs. Lin and said delightfully, “Mom, are you saying that you’ve recognized her as well? Mom, the apocalypse happened, and even zombies are talking. So, what is impossible? My sister is so powerful. She can’t possibly be killed by those people.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin sighed, “Ah, I had the same thoughts. But, I’m old, and I only believe in reality. I haven’t seen it with my own eyes, so how can I possibly believe it? How did you find out that she’s your…”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin didn’t finish the last word, but rolled her eyes and glanced at Lin Qiao again.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen said with a low voice, “I’ve been suspecting her since the beginning too. No stranger will come all the way to find and help us without doing anything for herself, right? To prove my guess, I dug into her current identity. According to the result I got, Lu Tianyu used to be an evil woman who liked doing bad things. She died a few months ago. So now, she became a zombie.”</p> <p>“Evil? Liked doing bad things? How did she die?” asked Mrs. Lin with surprise.</p> <p>“I heard that before she died, she did something… and that offended someone. So, she was killed and thrown into a zombie crowd. Her body was never found,” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing said that Lu Tianyu raped Wu Chengyue before she died. Lin Wenwen decided not to tell her mother about it, as she guessed that her mother wouldn’t want to know.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin looked at her and asked with anticipation, “When she asked you what you were thinking, were you thinking about that? Did she admit?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen nodded, her pretty face wearing her excitement. “Yes, that was what I was thinking. I just don’t know how she figured it out. Also, she admitted it in front of so many people!” she said.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin was a little stunned as she murmured, “She admitted… So she really is…”</p> <p>When Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen were trying to confirm who Lin Qiao really was, Lin Qiao, who had been talking to Lin Feng and the others, had heard every word they said, not clearly though.</p> <p>She stayed composed and showed no change of expression, only having her eyes glow dimly.</p> <p>“It’s afternoon already. People will stop working for the day in about an hour. I want to go to the construction site and take a look. You can do your own things… Don’t worry about me,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“I’ll go with you then,” said Yuan Tianxing, “I haven’t been there today. I’ll also try to get you a small building on our way.”</p> <p>“Alright,” Lin Qiao nodded and replied.</p> <p>She stood up while speaking as the others also packed their things and left, with the meeting being over.</p> <p>Lin Qiao and Yuan Tianxing walked out of the lobby and headed toward the river. The river was nearby, only about one mile away, so Lin Qiao decided not to drive. By walking, she could get a better chance to observe the surrounding environment.</p>",
  "Chapter 399: The Old Man Who Performed A Supervisory Role": "<p>People were working on the construction site with their upper bodies bared, sweating heavily. They had all been tanned over the past ten days.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao and Yuan Tianxing arrived, they all glanced at the two of them.</p> <p>Li Zheng and his people were managing the construction site. They walked to Qiao and Yuan Tianxing at the sight of them. Li Zheng looked at Lin Qiao as a life-saver and quickly said, “Ah, Miss. Lu is finally back! Please tell that one to go away…”</p> <p>While speaking, he pointed at the elderly zombie who was wandering in the construction site with his hands behind his back.</p> <p>The workers on the construction site would have their body turn stiff and limbs become inflexible when the elderly zombie approached them. But still, they had to keep working while he was nearby. They just couldn’t stop.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had sensed the old zombie’s vibe before she arrived. As she got here, she saw him strolling in the construction site without doing anything special. She looked around and found that the area on the other side of the river was assigned to the elderly zombie earlier on by her to guard.</p> <p>The zombie old man’s clothes were still clean. Lin Qiao didn’t know how long he had been wearing those clothes for. She wondered if he would take those off to wash while nobody saw him. Otherwise, how could those clothes be so clean?</p> <p>As Lin Qiao looked at him, the zombie old man immediately stopped walking, then turned and walked toward her.</p> <p>Seeing him approach, Li Zheng instantly moved to another side of Lin Qiao and said to her with a bitter face, “You have no idea! Since the day we started working here, he’s been watching us. We were scared to death that day! Thankfully, Qiu Lili came over later and made some peace. But, since that day, he comes here every day just to watch us. He has nothing else to do except walk about in the construction site with his hands behind his body. If any of us get a little lazy, he would silently stand behind him and gaze straight at him.”</p> <p>Upon hearing Li Zheng’s description, Lin Qiao imagined that some workers decided to take a little rest, but suddenly felt that someone was behind them, and then turned back to find a zombie leader silently standing behind them. That was pretty scary for sure!</p> <p>She looked at the zombie old man and laughed, “You can’t do this. You’ll hinder their work.”</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie old man roared at her with discontentment.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao was here, the others were less afraid of him.</p> <p>“What did he say?” Yuan Tianxing asked curiously.</p> <p>“He’s unhappy,” said Lin Qiao, “He said that he’s supervising these people. If any of them isn’t doing his work, he’ll drag him away and eat him. He’s being a supervisor.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s words sent shivers down the spines of all who had heard them.</p> <p>After saying that, Lin Qiao looked at those people with a big smile and continued, “I was kidding. He doesn’t need a reason to attack people. Do you think zombies need reasons to attack you? I’ve given my zombies strict orders, so they won’t hurt people.”</p> <p>Li Zheng and the others knew that her zombies wouldn’t hurt people. However, those people still found them very scary when they even approached.</p> <p>“So… what did he say just now?”</p> <p>“He just said that I owe him ten days of water,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“What water?” The others looked at her confusedly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she looked at zombie old man and said, “Give me your cup.”</p> <p>Then, the others saw the zombie old man rummage under his clothes, and then noticed that there was a bag hiding under his loose-fitting clothes.</p> <p>Next, they saw the old man zombie take out a cup and hand it to Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? It’s not the cup I gave him!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the ceramic cup with lid, then glanced at the old man zombie with surprise.</p> <p>She didn’t say anything, but took over the cup and shook her hand. In two seconds, the cup in her hand was filled with water.</p> <p>She handed the cup of water to the old man zombie, and the latter took it over.</p> <p>The others thought that he would drink it immediately, but he didn’t. Instead, he took over the cup and put on the lid, then turned and left.</p> <p>The others watched him walk up to the second floor of a half-torn-down building nearby, grab a chair there, and sit down.</p> <p>Only after that did he raise the cup and began drinking the water with an elegant manner.</p> <p>“Was he drinking that water as tea?” The others looked at Lin Qiao with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shrugged and said, “Maybe.”</p> <p>“Do you need to give them water everyday?” asked Yuan Tianxing, “Do zombies need water as well?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him and responded, “They surely don’t need ordinary water.” After saying that, she walked into the construction site and took a look at the current work. She and the others were now standing before a bridge, which would be the gate of the base center.</p> <p>She observed the surrounding environment but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing stood behind her, telling her about the current progress. For anything she could think of, Yuan Tianxing and the others had thought that already.</p> <p>The nearby buildings had been torn down. Lin Qiao guessed that only earth-powered people like Yuan Tianxing were able to do a wide range demolition like that.</p> <p>She took a look at the surrounding small buildings. All of them looked twenty or thirty years old.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing guessed what she wanted a small building for. “You want to put a small building in your space, right? Why don’t we go over there? The buildings here are all residential buildings, with five to seven floors. You can find some smaller, independent buildings over there,” he said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced where he pointed at, then turned back. The buildings in this area were all old indeed. The relatively newer ones all had five or six floors, and the smaller ones looked dangerous. Those buildings might fall down soon.</p> <p>“Alright, let’s go over there and take a look,” she nodded, then followed Yuan Tianxing to that area.</p> <p>“Lin Yu, go and bring the car. We’ll drive there,” Yuan Tianxing said to Lin Yu, who stood beside him.</p> <p>“Yes, sir,” Lin Yu responded, then turned and ran to the side of the construction site. Soon, he drove a black off-road vehicle over. Lin Qiao and Yuan Tianxing sat into the backseat. After that, Lin Yu drove the car toward where Yuan Tianxing pointed at.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, they arrived at a residential area. All buildings there were independent and two or three stories tall, built by their previous owners.</p> <p>Lin Qiao got off the car and found that all those buildings looked less than ten years old. She guessed that these buildings were built just a couple of years before the apocalypse, and their previous owner hadn’t lived in them for long.</p> <p>“What do you think? The buildings here look nice, don’t they?” Yuan Tianxing got off the car and asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded. Those buildings weren’t fancy, yet looked sturdy enough. They were her best choice at the moment, as the villa area was a bit far from here.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found a relatively good-looking building, then pointed at it and said, “This one. Let’s take a look inside.”</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded and followed her to the doors of the building.</p> <p>This building had double doors. The door outside was made from iron, and the one inside was wooden. The doors weren’t broken, but were wide open, with dark-brown stains. That was the most often-seen kind of stain in the buildings which still had people in them after the apocalypse.</p> <p>That dark-brown color was the color of blood which had been dried over the years.</p>",
  "Chapter 400: Take A Building": "<p>Lin Qiao walked into the building and took a glance at the furniture pieces inside. This place should have had no visitors since the apocalypse, as the disordered, overturned furniture pieces were all covered in a thick layer of dust.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked closer and found that all those furniture pieces were new, but dirty. As she waved a hand, an ink-black stream of mist was released from her palm, sweeping toward the furniture and decorations in the living room.</p> <p>Once the mist was released, Yuan Tianxing had a feeling that he could not approach it. He stood at the door and asked, “You actually have that power too? Are you double-powered?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced back at him and responded, “Sort of.”</p> <p>Afterward, Yuan Tianxing saw that nothing was left in the places touched by the black mist. The tables, chairs, couches, and all the other things made from different materials directly vanished.</p> <p>Even the hard alloy pieces had melted and vanished.</p> <p>The black mist melted anything it touched.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing watched the mist take a circle in the living room and then return into Lin Qiao’s palm with fright. After that, the entire living room was emptied with not a thing left in it. Lin Qiao actually tidied the living room up in such a simple and violent way.</p> <p>After cleaning the living room, she walked up to the second floor. There were three rooms on the second floor: two bedrooms and one study room. At the end of the corridor was a bathroom. Lin Qiao made everything in those rooms disappear, then went up to the third floor.</p> <p>There were only two room on the third floor, one larger and the other smaller. A roomy balcony was located on the other side of that floor, and by the balcony was an iron ladder leading to the roof.</p> <p>Soon, Lin Qiao leaped onto the roof.</p> <p>After taking a look at the roof deck, she jumped back down.</p> <p>After roughly cleaning the last two rooms, she walked downstairs.</p> <p>“It’s ready. You only need to get the part above the foundation out of the earth for me,” said Lin Qiao to Yuan Tianxing, who was leaning against the car and smoking.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing nodded, then reached out a hand toward that building and slightly pressed down. Then, he slowly raised his hand as if he was holding something.</p> <p>Along with his moves, the earth began quaking, and the building that Lin Qiao had picked started shaking. Clouds of dust were shaken off the walls, and next, the entire building slowly sank a little, then stopped moving.</p> <p>“Done!” Yuan Tianxing dropped his hand and said.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and walked in, holding the door and saying ‘in’ in her head. In the next second, the building disappeared from their eyes, leaving an empty area behind.</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned and got into the car as she said, “Let’s go.”</p> <p>Having finished with that, the three of them returned to the Victoria Hotel, where the others were having dinner. Lin Qiaos split up with Yuan Tianxing and went directly up to the fifth floor.</p> <p>She walked into Qiu Lili’s room and saw the latter gazing out of the window. Sensing her come in, the latter turned around.</p> <p>“Things here are mainly stable,” said Lin Qiao, “This couple of days, I’ll search through the area around the zombie wall to see if I can find more human food.”</p> <p>The food that could be stored for a long time should still be found from some hotels, restaurants, and chain markets, especially stuff like rice, salt, and some canned food.</p> <p>“Why do you always help them collect food and supplies?” said Qiu Lili with discontentment, “Why don’t you just let them do it themselves? Besides, how long are you gonna protect them for?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed and said, “They don’t have enough people now. It’ll take ages for them to build only a fence wall. How can they possibly have time to collect food? Even if they tried to do it, they wouldn’t go too far.”</p> <p>“You should try and find military bases. Army provisions can be preserved for a longer time. You’ll get a greater harvest from a military base than from other places,” said Liu Jun, who was sitting on the couch.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and replied, “I know that an army force used to station nearby, and I think there is an air force station in Jia Xing. We can go over there and search when we have time.”</p> <p>Hearing about going out, Qiu Lili nodded and said happily, “Great! We can first search through the entire Upper City District and then start looking for military bases.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a moment and responded, “That might take a long time… about a month. Right now, no average level human being or zombie can enter this area. We are able to sense this area while we’re in the Upper City District. But once we leave, the defense of this place would decrease a lot.”</p> <p>“What are you worrying about?” said Qiu Lili with confusion, “Three level-six human beings are here. They won’t encounter any troubles, will they?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “Sea City Base is the nearest human base. Apart from Wu Chengyue and Zou Shihui, the robber who showed up in that base earlier was also at level-seven. And, he has run out.”</p> <p>“Are you worrying that the robber might come this way?” said Qiu Lili while thinking.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “I’ve met that robber once. Before we entered Sea City Base, he was already coming after Lin Feng, Yuan Tianxing, and the others. Even though his partner, Yang Chao has fallen, I think he’ll keep having his eyes on us.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Qiu Lili wore a worried look as she said, “Ugh, should we find him first? Otherwise, we won’t be able to go out to collect supplies, will we?”</p> <p>“You’re right!” said Lin Qiao, “So, before leaving Upper City District, we need to find out that robber’s whereabouts.”</p> <p>“In this case, your plan of going South will be postponed to winter, right?” said Liu Jun.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her as she nodded and said, “At least I need to wait for the situation here to stabilise. There is a hidden danger from that level-seven robber now, so I can’t just leave like this.”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded in agreement, “I think Lin Feng and the others are still too weak.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “In fact, they aren’t weak. After all, level-six superpowered human beings aren’t everywhere. The problem is that they might need to face a level-seven robber. That doesn’t happen a lot. They have no way of solving this problem, but I can sense the robber’s presence. Lili, did you discover something earlier?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili responded with surprise, “Eh? You knew?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “I saw you staring in that direction when I came in. In fact, I sensed it too.”</p> <p>Hearing her, Qiu Lili pouted and looked at Lin Qiao unhappily, “Your sensations are even sharper than mine. I’m at a higher level than you, but had already found it while I only started to notice it?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao laughed and said, “Why are you upset about that? You should know that we’re different.”</p>",
  "Chapter 401: They Have Had Suspicions Since Long Ago": "<p>“You were only at level three or four when I met you. It has been less than two months, but you’ve already broken into level-six, haven’t you?” Qiu Lili said, “If every zombie upgraded as quickly as you, all the human bases would have been destroyed by thousands of high-leveled zombies long ago.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao crossed her arms before her chest, then raised one hand to scratch her chin. While thinking, she said, “You’re right though! There are quite some intelligent zombies, but only a few of them managed to step into level-six and become zombie kings and queens. I’m a special case. Even my body wasn’t mine.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen glanced at her and asked abruptly, “Have Lin Wenwen… guessed out your true identity? The conversation you had today down in the lobby was a little weird.”</p> <p>Speaking of that, Lin Qiao laughed. “In fact, they have had suspicions about that since long ago. They just didn’t want to believe it,” she said, “When I woke up in this body, I didn’t believe it either. Back then, I thought that I was dreaming.”</p> <p>Liu Jun and Qiu Lili glanced at each other, understanding Lin Qiao. If they woke up in a strange place as a strange person, they would certainly be confused and unable to believe that it was real.</p> <p>However, as that didn’t really happen to them, they couldn’t feel exactly how Lin Qiao had felt.</p> <p>“But, why did they suspect you? You didn’t say it out loud, did you?” asked Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Lin Qiao responded, “My Mom isn’t young anymore. She only believes what she sees, but not what people say. However, as I have shown them quite some of my old habits on purpose, they’ll certainly have that kind of guesses. Perhaps, they only suspected that I was pretending to be Lin Qiao at first. But, Lin Wenwen is not like the others. If she had doubts, she would certainly try to find out the truth. So I guess she dug into Lu Tianyu’s life story back in Sea City Base.”</p> <p>She paused for a second, then continued, “She should have figured out that Lu Tianyu and I are different. After that, she’d start thinking about my purpose. As a stranger, I’ve helped them so many times. She’d think that I either have some special purpose, or am a family member.”</p> <p>“Back in Hades Base, Lin Wenwen was always protected. So, I guess she’s quite dependent on you. So, she’ll choose the idea which is good for her and her family to prove, and hope that it is true. I think she did that also because she just doesn’t want to believe that you’re already dead,” said Liu Jun.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded in agreement, “Yeah, you’re right. She always relied on me. After the base and I were destroyed, she must have suffered a hard strike.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili looked at her and said, “Should I call her silly or smart? Normally, people won’t believe something like that, yet she did! And it is truly real!”</p> <p>“She isn’t silly,” said Lin Qiao, “But, for something that she believes in, she could be very stubborn, and will try everything she can to find out the truth. Smart people can be silly sometimes too, and silly people… Well sometimes being silly is a kind of luck, and at other times, that is just a misfortune.”</p> <p>At that moment, there was a knock on the door.</p> <p>“Come in, please. The door isn’t locked,” Liu Jun answered the door.</p> <p>The door was gently pushed open, and standing behind it were Shen Yujen and Chen Yuting.</p> <p>Chen Yuting nodded at the three in the room, then said to Lin Qiao, “Miss. Lu, Jen says that she still wants to stay with you, so… please arrange a room for her on the fifth floor.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Shen Yujen and asked, “Why? Don’t you dare to live with him?”</p> <p>She thought that Shen Yujen would live with Chen Yuting, and Chen Yuting thought that too. Shen Yujen was the only one against that idea, and Chen Yuting just had to respect his wife’s wish.</p> <p>Shen Yujen nodded, then opened her mouth as she turned and pointed at Chen Yuting’s neck.</p> <p>She was worried that she might lose control of herself and bite Chen Yuting. If that happened, there would be trouble.</p> <p>Lin Qiao grinned at her and said, “You’re not a vampire. Why do you always stare at his veins?”</p> <p>After saying that, she continued to Chen Yuting, “Alright, I’ll get her a room. There’re plenty of rooms on the fifth floor anyway.”</p> <p>“Thank you! I’ll… get downstairs then,” said Chen Yuting to Lin Qiao gratefully, who nodded at him in response</p> <p>After Chen Yuting had left, Lin Qiao said to Liu Jun, “Junjun, you go and arrange a room for her. Ah, also, get a room for Xie Dong as well.”</p> <p>While speaking, Lin Qiao suddenly recalled that Xie Dong and the zombie dog were still in her space. Of course, she wouldn’t let the zombie dog out.</p> <p>Having finished talking, she stood up and flashed into her space.</p> <p>After entering her space, she looked at Xie Dong, who was sitting on a couch in a daze, and said, “Let’s go out… Let bygones be bygones! Some people aren’t worth for you to love. Maybe you can switch to a new relationship and forget about her.”</p> <p>Xie Dong raised his head as he looked at her with a dull, confused face. He spent a short while to process what Lin Qiao just said. He shook his head, then stood up and picked up his bag before walking up to Lin Qiao. The latter dragged his arm and flashed out.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao brought Xie Dong out of her space, Liu Jun put Tongtong down and stood up, turning and walking out to guide Xie Dong and Shen Yuzhen to their rooms.</p> <p>“You two follow me,” she said.</p> <p>Soon, Liu Jun came back and asked Lin Qiao with a strange expression, “Why do I feel that Xie Dong is down? What happened to him?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao responded, “Ah, him… something did happen to him. He found that the women that he had been loving doesn’t love him. And while he wasn’t home, she had been with other men. In fact, he just loved the wrong person. She doesn’t love him, and lied to him. Lying is a worse thing, so he needs some time to heal.”</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded with pity, “I see.”</p> <p>“Maybe I can send him to the construction site and find him some work to distract him with,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Liu Jun walked to the couch and sat down as she looked at Lin Qiao and said, “That’s a good idea. He seemed to be really lost just now. I’m afraid it’s gonna take a long while for him to find his way out.”</p> <p>Suddenly, Lin Qiao recalled something. She raised her head and asked Liu Jun, “Earlier, you mentioned the man who abandoned you. What’s his name?”</p> <p>Liu Jun was puzzled at first, then a dim light flashed across her eyes. “Huang Tianfei,” she responded.</p> <p>Lin Qiao clapped her hands and said with regret, “Ugh, no wonder I found his name familiar when Xie Dong’s woman called him. This didn’t come to my mind back then! So, he is the b*stard who abandoned you! If I knew it, I’d have done much more than just stripping that man and that woman!”</p>",
  "Chapter 402: Go And Find A Bucket": "<p>Liu Jun was a little stunned. “Are you saying that you… heard that name?” she looked at Lin Qiao and asked with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao crossed her arms before her chest, even squeezing her breasts slightly upward, as she said angrily, “I did not just hear his name… He’s one of those guys that Xie Dong’s woman hooked up with. When I got there, he was in that woman’s apartment. There was another guy, and they almost fought for that woman… Well, not exactly. The lower-leveled guy was kicked out by that woman.”</p> <p>After saying that, she put a finger on her chin and observed Liu Jun. “That man is… He looked younger than you. Is he younger than you?” she asked.</p> <p>Liu Jun first wore a surprised look, then became a little down. She glanced at Tongtong who was playing on the carpet, then had a better mood. “Yeah, he’s three years younger than me… I didn’t think that you’d actually see him. What a coincidence!”</p> <p>“He attacked Xie Dong,” said Lin Qiao, “Xie Dong bought that apartment for that woman. The furniture pieces there were quite new. I guess Xie Dong had dedicated all the zombie nuclei that he earned to trade for things which that woman wanted.”</p> <p>She spread her hands and continued helplessly, “Judging by that woman’s attitude toward him, I think she just loved to take while he was willing to give. However, it was indeed a sad thing for him to watch the woman he loved make out with another guy right in front of him, and talk about how to get rid of him.”</p> <p>“So, Qiaoqiao, did you witness Junjun’s unfaithful husband hook up with Xie Dong’s girlfriend, and hear them talk about how to get Xie Dong killed?” Qiu Lili came over and asked curiously.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised a hand as she pointed at her and nodded, “Yeah, that’s right, you’re right!” Then, she turned to Liu Jun and continued, “I didn’t realize that he was the b*stard you had mentioned. If I did, I’d do so much more than just strip him. I would cut off his d*ck and feed it to my dog… Ugh, forget it. I won’t do it, so disgusting!”</p> <p>The heavy atmosphere was instantly lightened by the last sentence that Lin Qiao said.</p> <p>“Do you have a dog?” asked Liu Jun. She was still a little angry though.</p> <p>Lin Qiao replied, “I do. I got a zombie dog when I was trying to find an energy nucleus for Viney on my way back to Sea City. It’s still tied in my space. In fact, Yang Yan was killed by that dog. I threw her into my space. It’s just that nobody knows about it yet.”</p> <p>While speaking, she put a finger in the middle of her lips.</p> <p>“You did that?” Liu Jun and Qiu Lili both looked at her in shock.</p> <p>“Yeah,” said Lin Qiao, “So today, I knocked that man and that woman out when I saw them in Xie Dong’s place. Then, I stripped them and threw them in the hallway.”</p> <p>Liu Jun and Qiu Lili felt a little speechless. That was such a nasty move! However, those two deserved that!</p> <p>“Junjun, I’ll get you some lake water later on. You need to soak yourself in it for a longer time. The energy in my lake is denser than before by many times. You can bathe in it for a whole night. You won’t be able to absorb all the energy contained in the water in just one night,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Liu Jun nodded.</p> <p>“I want to take a bath too! I want it too!” Hearing about the lake water bath, Qiu Lili immediately burst in yells. For zombies like Qiu Lili and Liu Jun, Lin Qiao’s lake water was like a hot spring for human beings. Bathing in it was comfortable and enjoyable, as well as good for the growth of their powers.</p> <p>“Don’t worry, you’ll get some too,” Lin Qiao nodded.</p> <p>So that night, Lin Qiao got Liu Jun, Qiu Lili, Xie Dong, Shen Yujen, and Mengmeng—who was on the roof—each a tubful of lake water for them to bathe in it for a whole night. After that, she went up to the roof and roared at the sky.</p> <p>“Roar!” She hadn’t roared like that for long. After uttering the roar, she touched her throat and felt a little weird.</p> <p>Following her voice, a few figures darted swiftly toward her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s roar had, of course, caught the attention of the people who lived on the lower floors. However, according to the rule, they shouldn’t mind the things happening on the fifth floor and the roof.</p> <p>The few figures from other roofs soon landed on Lin Qiao’s roof.</p> <p>Those were the five zombie leaders and the two level-four zombies, all standing in front of Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them and said, “I know that I had disappeared for a while and wasted you quite some days. So today, I’ll let you bath for an extra hour to thank you for guarding this area.”</p> <p>The seven zombies quietly looked at her. Even though they didn’t make any sound, Lin Qiao had already felt how happy they were.</p> <p>As she waved a hand, a one-meter-tall, large bucket appeared before those zombies.</p> <p>She pointed at the bucket and said, “Now, you each go and find a bucket this tall, or anything like this that can contain water and yourselves. You’ll be bathing in it. Go, now!”</p> <p>As she finished talking, the seven zombies all spent a short while staring at her with confusion. The crack-mouthed zombie boy, the zombie old man, and the two level-four zombies reacted relatively quickly, soon turning and leaving to find buckets for themselves.</p> <p>The middle-aged male zombie and the other two seemed to not understand why they needed to find buckets.</p> <p>“Go and find it,” said Lin Qiao to the three of them, “Don’t you want a bath? Or, do you only need to drink water?”</p> <p>The three zombies understood that the water which Lin Qiao talked about was what they had been expecting for days. However, they only knew that that water was for drinking, but not that they could also bathe in it. So, when Lin Qiao mentioned earlier about taking a bath, they didn’t understand her. And now, as Lin Qiao asked them to find a bucket, they just didn’t know what it would be for.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed and said to them, “Ugh! Just go and find a bucket each. How will you take a bath if you don’t have a bucket? Go!”</p> <p>The three zombie leaders had no other choice but to leave with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao knew that they wouldn’t be back so soon. So, after the seven zombies had left, she glanced at the area that Qiu Lili was gazing at earlier. Then, she abruptly turned invisible and leaped off the building.</p> <p>When she left, Qiu Lili and Mengmeng both glanced at the area where she was headed to, but didn’t make any move.</p> <p>Downstairs, Yuan Tianxing and the other few who were at level six and five all sensed that Lin Qiao’s vibe was gone. They didn’t know where she had gone.</p> <p>They thought that she went back into her space.</p> <p>The invisible Lin Qiao swiftly leaped across the roofs, utility poles, and treetops, soon crossing the zombie wall and arriving miles away from it. However, she didn’t stop, but kept going outward.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later, she landed on top of a tall building which was located ten miles away from the new base site, in Wangjiang Street. This area was close to Qian River. The vibe from the river covered most of the vibes around it, and the wind was strong.</p> <p>If Lin Qiao’s sensations weren’t much sharper than Qiu Lili’s, she wouldn’t be able to sense that a level-seven superpowered man was hiding near the river.</p>",
  "Chapter 403: Tang He Is Scared Away": "<p>Lin Qiao stood on top of that building. There was another person on the roof, facing where Lin Qiao came from with his eyes closed, seeming to have been sensing something. He didn’t sense that Lin Qiao was right behind him as he kept his posture while standing there.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t expect to really find out his location. What she had sensed from him was faint and unclear. She knew that what Qiu Lili had felt was the same, as the latter’s sensations were weaker than hers.</p> <p>Qiu Lili didn’t take it seriously, but Lin Qiao was on the alert.</p> <p>She began wondering how she should deal with this level-seven post-apocalyptic robber. Should she directly attack him? She wasn’t sure if she would be able to drive him away by fighting him.</p> <p>After all, she was only at level-six. If she put her superpower and physical strength together, she might be able to make the fight end in a tie, but Viney had told her to not fight too hard!</p> <p>So now, she was only able to make long-range attacks, but no close combat!</p> <p>However, the advantages she had would be cut in half if she weren’t going to start any close combat.</p> <p>She pondered for a while, then decided to launch a sneak attack first. The smart and cunning Viney should have a special skill to protect herself anyway.</p> <p>After making up her mind, Lin Qiao raised her hands and popped her claws. Her claws looked black and translucent in her invisible state, as strong as ever.</p> <p>She quietly walked up behind that robber and straightened her right hand to make her four sharp claws look like the tips of blades. After that, she suddenly lunged that hand toward the back of the robber’s head.</p> <p>Ting!</p> <p>A shrill noise was heard as Lin Qiao’s claws brushed across the back of his head and went to one side of his face.</p> <p>Tang He immediately turned around and made a step backward. He looked behind him in shock, but saw no one.</p> <p>“Who is it? Get out!”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao watched his reaction with surprise.</p> <p>Did he sense her attack coming? He actually shielded the back of his head with his metal power.</p> <p>“Get out! Are you too afraid to show your face? But, you’re daring enough to attack me sneakily!” Tang He shouted at the cold air as he looked around, still seeing no one.</p> <p>At the same time, Lin Qiao was standing right beside him, looking at him confusedly.</p> <p>He clearly wasn’t able to sense her presence, but how did he manage to protect himself against her attack?</p> <p>Tang He was a little panicked at the moment, but he didn’t show that on his face.</p> <p>He didn’t know what hit him on the back of his head just now. If he hadn’t had his back and his skull covered in metal the whole time, his head would have been punctured.</p> <p>Just now, he didn’t sense any attempts of attacking or murderous intention.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t show her face as he asked, and just stood near him to carefully observe his expressions. She wasn’t able to read his mind, but did sense some of his watchful vibe.</p> <p>Tang He shouted a few times but saw no one show up. After that, he started feeling endangered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a while staring at his neck side and found that his skin was covered in a thin layer of metal. After the first attack, he was already on full alert. Therefore, further sneak attacks would be meaningless.</p> <p>Right at that moment, Tang He suddenly leaped upward, stepped on the edge of the roof, and jumped off the building at lightning speed. Within a blink, he disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hopped onto the stage by the edge of the roof and saw him fleeing speedily toward West Lake District, but didn’t chase him. Watching him leave quickly, Lin Qiao guessed that he wouldn’t come back anytime soon. So, she turned and headed back to the new base.</p> <p>Back on the roof of Victoria Hotel, Lin Qiao found no zombies come back with buckets. With nothing else to do, she flashed back into her space to play with the dog.</p> <p>The zombie dog was startled when she suddenly showed up. It was lying on the ground and sleeping; as Lin Qiao popped up before its eyes, it sprung up from the earth.</p> <p>“Roar…”</p> <p><em>‘Damn! You scared the hell out of me!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao heard its roar and silently translated it into human language.</p> <p>“Whoooo…”</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao, the zombie dog bent its limbs and lowered its head vigilantly, staring at her with sharp eyes while roaring with a deep voice.</p> <p>“What are you doing? Roaring at me? I might kick you’re a*s! I was going to offer you some water. Do you want water?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted in front of the dog, picked up a branch, and pointed it at the dog while speaking.</p> <p>“Bow-wow…” The zombie dog didn’t like being threatened, so it barked at Lin Qiao and bared its teeth. There was only a short distance between them, yet the dog didn’t dare to pounce on her and bite.</p> <p>Lin Qiao curiously stared at the vine around the dog’s neck. Viney had disappeared, but this vine didn’t. Even its color didn’t change.</p> <p>She stood up and walked toward the lake. Passing by the strawberry field, she found that the strawberries hadn’t been picked for a long time. There were many ripe and large strawberries there now.</p> <p>She couldn’t help but pick two strawberries, wipe them with her sleeve, then put one in her mouth.</p> <p>As she made a bite, a sour flavor spread in her mouth and sent shivers to her whole body. But after that sourness, a strange and slight pleasure stimulated her brain.</p> <p><em>‘Eh?’</em></p> <p>She was puzzled for a second, then made another bite. As she expected, she again shivered because of the sourness, after which, that pleasure gushed into her brain and soon disappeared.</p> <p>While eating, she found a soup bowl and fetched some water from the lake with it, then carried it to the woods and squatted to put it before the zombie dog.</p> <p>“Here, have some water!”</p> <p>In fact, she didn’t know if the zombie dog needed water or not, even though the other zombies all desperately wanted the water.</p> <p>The zombie dog glanced at the bowl of water, then at Lin Qiao, then turned back to the water, but didn’t touch it. At that moment, Lin Qiao sensed that some zombie leaders were back. So, she stood up and said to the zombie dog, “I’ll leave it here. You can choose to drink it or not.”</p> <p>After saying that, she flashed out.</p> <p>Once she was back on the roof, she saw the two level-four zombies standing there, each holding a large plastic bucket. As Lin Qiao showed up, they all looked at her with anticipation.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to them and checked their buckets. Those buckets were similar to the ones in her space, and weren’t broken.</p> <p>She nodded and said, “These will do. Later on, you should bring them back into your own places after the bath. Next time, you can still use them.”</p> <p>Having finished talking, she took over the two buckets and flashed back to the lakeside.</p> <p>She took off her shoes and walked into the lake with bare feet. After filling the two buckets, she exited her space.</p> <p>Boom! Boom!</p> <p>She put the two buckets of water on the ground, then said to the two level-four zombies, “Take off your clothes and get in.”</p> <p>Those two had already learned how to take off their clothes and put them back on, as Lin Qiao had taught them in her space. Once Lin Qiao finished talking, they quickly stripped themselves and stepped into the buckets, despite their different genders.</p>",
  "Chapter 404: Bathe The Zombies": "<p>As the two started bathing themselves, Lin Qiao stood aside and kept waiting. Soon, the zombie boy came back with an iron bucket, which was even taller than himself, carried on his head.</p> <p>Clang!</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched him put that empty gasoline can loudly before her face.</p> <p>Smelling the strong scent of gasoline, Lin Qiao had a bad feeling. “You didn’t pour all the gas in it away, did you…”</p> <p>The crack-mouthed zombie boy looked at her confusedly, as if he was saying to her with his eyes— <em>‘You didn’t tell me to keep the ‘water’ in it… That ‘water’ was stinky and greasy… Why would I keep it…?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t know what to say. Looking at the zombie boy’s innocent eyes, she covered her forehead with a hand.</p> <p>“Alright, alright, it’s okay… Next time, don’t pour away that kind of stinky water, alright? Bring it to me. I need it,” Lin Qiao sighed and said to him.</p> <p>The zombie boy had even washed that bucket, as there was still some water in it.</p> <p>“Roar…” The zombie boy replied. <em>‘Understood.’</em></p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao reached out a hand to take over the iron bucket, then flashed into her space. After filling the bucket, she came back out.</p> <p>The zombie boy gazed at the large bucket of water, his dark eyes glowing brightly.</p> <p>“You need to take off your clothes before getting in. Do you understand?” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘Take off your clothes’ </em>? What did that mean?</p> <p>The zombie boy looked at her confusedly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sighed again and took off his clothes for him. She gave him those clothes last time before she left, and they were already dirty. She now felt that she had to teach her zombies how to wash clothes!</p> <p>After stripping the zombie boy, Lin Qiao pointed at the iron bucket and said, “Alright, get in.”</p> <p>Plop!</p> <p>With that, the zombie boy immediately jumped in.</p> <p>“Thank God I dodged fast enough, or you’d get me wet,” Lin Qiao, who had nimbly made a step aside, said to the zombie boy who was entirely soaked in the bucket now.</p> <p>The zombie boy was too short. He was able to stick his head out of the water by standing, but once he sat down, he was entirely soaked in the water.</p> <p>However, he didn’t care, as zombies didn’t need to breathe anyway.</p> <p>Lin Qiao waited for one hour and a half for all the zombie leaders to come back.</p> <p>Those zombie leaders brought back all sorts of buckets, but thankfully, none of them was made of iron, but only plastic and wooden. Some of the buckets were even nearly sealed, with only small openings in them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao cut them open with her claws for those zombies to sit in.</p> <p>While watching the zombie old man put a large wooden bucket in front of her, Lin Qiao asked with surprise, “Where did you find such a huge wooden bucket?</p> <p>Did people still use wooden buckets before the apocalypse?</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked closer at the bucket, then continued in shock, “I think it’s antique… It looks very old.”</p> <p><em>‘But even antiques are worthless now, </em>‘ she thought.</p> <p>She filled all the buckets, then told the zombies to take off their clothes and sit inside the buckets.</p> <p>The zombie old man started doing strange things again when it was his turn to get into the water. Lin Qiao looked at him confusedly, “Why are you looking at me? Take off your clothes!”</p> <p>The zombie old man spent a while staring at her, then looked around, as if he was trying to find something. After failing to find what he wanted, he turned and darted away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao confusedly watched him run away, then come back with a chair. She just didn’t know what to say at this moment.</p> <p>“Just tell me next time when you need a chair…” Lin Qiao looked at him helplessly.</p> <p>The zombie old man ignored her. As she filled up his bucket, he carried the chair to the other side of the stair room, then came back with empty hands and dragged the wooden bucket over there.</p> <p>Lin Qiao saw that he dragged the bucket behind a wall, then slowly took off his clothes, exposing his scrawny body. After that, he folded his clothes neatly and put them on the chair.</p> <p>He might have sensed that Lin Qiao was watching him. He gave her a glance, then turned around and showed her his wrinkled butt. Then, he stepped into the wooden bucket and sat down.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him, feeling really speechless.</p> <p><em>‘You’re only taking a bath! Why did you make it so complicated? Have you forgotten that you’re a zombie? Zombie grandpa! </em>‘ she thought.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Back in her space, the zombie dog spent a short while looking around after Lin Qiao left a bowl of water here, then confirmed that nobody was there. Only after that did it slowly get up from the ground and approach the water bowl.</p> <p>The scent of the water had been attracting it.</p> <p>It stuck out of its tongue and licked the water, then froze for a second. Afterward, the dog’s eyes glowed.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? Energy!’</em></p> <p>It licked again and found that the energy was real. After that, it buried its head in the bowl and started gulping.</p> <p>On the outside, Lin Qiao watched all the zombies sit into their buckets, then turned and went downstairs. There, she saw Lin Wenwen and Mrs. Lin standing in the hallway, seemingly waiting for her.</p> <p>Seeing the look in their eyes, Lin Qiao figured out what they came for. She walked up to them, then headed toward another room.</p> <p>Liu Jun had tidied all the rooms on the fifth floor while she had nothing else to do. So by now, all the rooms on this floor was clean.</p> <p>“Only two of you? I thought Lin Feng and the others will come too. Follow me…” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Mrs. Lin glanced at each other, then followed her into that room. As they all walked in, Lin Wenwen closed the door.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pointed at the two couches in the room, then dragged over a wooden chair for herself to sit down. Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen sat on the couches. Both of them had their bodies tightened, looking quite nervous and restless.</p> <p>Lin Qiao only casually sat on the chair while looking at the two of them.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Mrs. Lin had been staring at her without knowing what to say since they sat down. As they didn’t start a conversation, Lin Qiao had no choice but to do that herself.</p> <p>“Don’t you have questions to ask me?” she said.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin only looked at Lin Qiao with hesitation, as she wasn’t so sure yet. As she stayed silent, Lin Wenwen said, “… You should know what we want to ask you.”</p> <p>“I do, but I’m not sure if you’ll believe me,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen popped her eyes as she gazed at Lin Qiao eagerly and asked, <em>‘So… is it real? Are you really back?’</em></p> <p>She didn’t say those words out loud, but inside. She knew that Lin Qiao could hear her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her but didn’t answer those questions immediately. Instead, she turned to Mrs. Lin and asked with a gentle voice, “Do you believe it too?”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin looked at her and suddenly found that Lin Qiao’s eyes were showing some anticipation as well. She couldn’t help but feel a slight heartache as she nodded.</p> <p>How could she forget about that? If this person standing right in front of her was really her eldest daughter, how would she be feeling? She would be in pain if her family didn’t believe her.</p> <p>Thinking about how Lin Qiao might have been feeling recently. Mrs. Lin felt sad, and her eyes turned red.</p>",
  "Chapter 405: Tell Her Families The Truth": "<p>“So how… how did you become like this, sister?” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her, then at Mrs. Lin, sighing, “You can ask me that, but I don’t know how to answer. I woke up to find that I’ve become this woman. You didn’t see how I looked at first. Even my face was broken back then, and so was my stomach.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin glanced at Lin Wenwen with red eyes. She didn’t expect Lin Wenwen to directly call ‘sister’ out loud, and Lin Qiao to just accept that.</p> <p>She was truly her Qiao!</p> <p>As she finally confirmed Lin Qiao’s identity, Mrs. Lin couldn’t stop her tears from streaming down her cheeks.</p> <p>“Don’t cry. Am I not back?” Lin Qiao took a piece of tissue from the table and handed it to Mrs. Lin as she said gently. Mrs. Lin only sobbed in response, but didn’t say anything.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen held Mrs. Lin’s hands and said, “Mom, shouldn’t you be laughing right now? Why are you crying!” She said that with a smile, but her eyes had turned red too.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood in front of them and said to them, “I was in Sea City when I woke up. The previous owner of my body was from Sea City Base. She died, killed by zombies. So, when I woke up, I woke up as a zombie… very ugly, and with inflexible limbs.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Mrs. Lin were slightly distracted by her words. “When did you wake up?” Both of them asked with curiosity.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat back into the chair and said, “About three months ago. I heard that was the exact time when Hades Base was destroyed. I knew nothing about you when I woke up, so I decided to take a shot by going to the South to find you guys. And I really found you.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin found Lin Qiao’s words a little weird. She wiped her tears, then couldn’t help but ask, “What do you mean by ‘you heard’? Don’t you remember that?”</p> <p>“My memory stopped at the point before the apocalypse,” said Lin Qiao, “I don’t remember anything that happened in the recent few years. At first, I thought Lin Qiao from Hades Base was another person.”</p> <p>Both Lin Wenwen and Mrs. Lin were stunned and gave each other a glance filled with confusion, What did Lin Qiao mean by her memory stopping before the apocalypse?</p> <p>Mrs. Lin popped her eyes to look at Lin Qiao with surprise, then said after a short hesitation, “Are you saying that you don’t remember the things that happened in the recent few years?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen too had been staring at Lin Qiao with shock. Both she and her mother were waiting for Lin Qiao’s answer.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “No, I don’t remember. When I woke up, all I could remember was that I had a bad fever, so I stayed in my dorm, took some medicine, and got to bed to rest. Unexpectedly, I woke up to find my soul in someone else’s body after that. As for when the apocalypse happened, and what I did in the recent five years, I don’t remember any of it.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen and Mrs. Lin gazed at Lin Qiao without knowing how to react.</p> <p>Lin Qiao continued, “Fortunately, I still remembered who I was. If I had forgotten that, there would be no one to save your lives.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Wenwen finally recovered from the shock. “So… so… so… Sister, you don’t remember how you died, do you? And, or… Did you do something to bring yourself into Lu Tianyu’s body?” she asked, still sounding a little confused.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “I’ve told you that I don’t remember.”</p> <p>“Why didn’t you tell us earlier?” Mrs. Lin complained at that moment. After saying that, she almost started crying again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hurriedly comforted her, “Mom… don’t cry. I didn’t tell you because I hadn’t figured out the situation yet. Even I was confused, so how was I supposed to tell you about what happened? Besides, even if I said the truth directly to you once I saw you, would you believe me? No normal people would believe that, right? We don’t live in a fiction where people can reincarnate.”</p> <p>“Didn’t you reincarnate?” said Lin Wenwen, “You reincarnated into someone else’s body and came back to life! This is really like something that happens in a fiction!”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin thought for a moment over her words, then nodded in agreement, “You’re right. If you told us at first, we wouldn’t believe you. How could such a thing possibly happen? But, now you… Has your soul come back, or did something else happen there?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and responded, “I have no idea.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen suddenly thought of something, so she spoke, “Ah, thankfully that Lu Tianyu was already dead when you reincarnated into her body. You only borrowed her body which she couldn’t use anymore. If you reincarnated into a living person’s body, would you have to share the body with that person? Or, would you fight over it?”</p> <p>While speaking, she fixed her glowing eyes on Lin Qiao with excitement.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at her and said, “If that was the case, what you said might happen.”</p> <p>At that moment, the look in Mrs. Lin’s eyes changed as she spoke abruptly, “Perhaps, it’s a good thing for you to forget about what happened in these years.”</p> <p>“It might be better if you never remember certain things.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her mother, knowing what she was thinking of. However, even if she could never remember those things, she would figure them out in some other way.</p> <p>“Mom, even if I can’t remember, I’m still gonna find out exactly how the Hades Base was broken. Did I really put too much trust in that guy named Yang Jianhua? But, I had no feelings when I saw him. Why?” she asked with great confusion.</p> <p>Hearing her mention Yang Jianhua, both Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen had their expression changed as Mrs. Lin said wrathfully, “Yang Jianhua is not a good person! He is treacherous and sly! If you see him again, you better kick his a*s hard! He’s the reason why you became like this, and why we escaped here!”</p> <p>“He is a pervert! Nasty man! Scum!” Lin Wenwen added through clenched teeth.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them bewilderedly, and couldn’t help but ask, “Is he really that bad? What exactly did he do? I didn’t get the full details from Du Yuanxing and Qingying. Tell me what happened.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen glanced at each other. After that, the latter turned to Lin Qiao and said, “Sister, do you really not remember him at all? He lied to you, and all of us!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao frowned as she said confusedly, “This time… I think I have remembered one thing. However, my memories aren’t clear. I seem to remember that I was forced to a cliff, facing five men, all at level-seven. The one in the middle was… pretty? I remember that I blew myself up in that place… My power was a black fire… A huge black fire exploded… Ouch!”</p> <p>While speaking, that picture emerged in her mind again, following which came waves of sharp pain that made her give out a muffled moan.</p>",
  "Chapter 406: The Hidden Problem In Earth Dragon Base": "<p>Lin Qiao gave a muffled moan and quickly covered her forehead.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?” Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen were both startled, and they hurriedly got close to her.</p> <p>“I’m… fine… It’s just… these memories… are probably giving me a headache…” Lin Qiao said while enduring the sharp pain from her brain. She took a few deep breaths in a row, then forced those pictures out of her mind. Only after that did she feel better.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen looked at her with surprise while Mrs. Lin asked confusedly, “Does your memory give you a headache? Don’t try to remember then.”</p> <p>“Sister, do you still want to know what happened before?” said Lin Wenwen with hesitation.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Wenwen and said, “Don’t tell her just yet. Look at her. Hearing about those things will also give her a headache, won’t it?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao waved a hand toward Mrs. Lin and said, “No, I… I want to hear it… Even if I don’t hear it from you, I’ll make another trip to the South later to find that place where I blew myself up. I think I’ll be able to find something there… I’ve been having this feeling…”</p> <p>“But…” Mrs. Lin looked at her with concern.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gently made Mrs. Lin sat back into the couch and said, “If I can’t get through this, I might never restore my memory.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin didn’t say anything else, so Lin Wenwen carried on, “When the apocalypse happened, you and our big brother both came back from the army. The rest of us stayed at home fighting to survive for half a month before you and our big brother finally showed up with your squad. The next year after the apocalypse, you were entrapped during one mission. You were drawn to the zombie city and trapped in there. The one who entrapped you was Yang Jianhua. He made you get stuck there for a long time before he rescued you.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao thought for a second and asked, “Why did he entrap me? Did I know him already back then?”</p> <p>If he were a stranger, she would definitely stay vigilant against him. Therefore, the one who was able to trick her into a zombie city had to be a familiar person.</p> <p>“He bribed one of your squad members. I think he asked that guy to give you false information. We don’t know exactly what happened, but we did know that you almost died there at that time,” said Mrs. Lin.</p> <p>“Since that place was so dangerous, how did he rescue me?” asked Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“We don’t know,” Mrs. Lin shook her head.</p> <p>Lin Wenwen thought for a short while with a frown, then said abruptly, “I think he went there with other people, but only showed up alone when they found you. You treated him very well because you wanted to thank him for saving your life. However, it turned out that he was undercover!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “He was undercover for years. That’s impressive!”</p> <p>…</p> <p>When Lin Wenwen and Mrs. Lin were telling Lin Qiao about the things that happened in the recent years, Yang Jianhua was trying to figure out a way to get the level-six zombie nucleus from Yang Jianhua back in the Hades Base, so that he could break into a higher level.</p> <p>For that purpose, he tried everything he could to tantalize Long Yubai when they were doing that thing on the bed that night. Only when the latter started falling unconscious did he start asking for the zombie nucleus, half threateningly and half temptingly.</p> <p>“Bai, that zombie nucleus is meant for me, isn’t it? Just give it to me. I can only manage Earth Dragon Base well for you after I step into a higher level, isn’t that true? You don’t want to always rely on those vice-leaders, do you?” He laid upon Long Yubai and said eagerly while looking at him in the eyes. He seemed to have been controlled by his sensations, but a cold gleam of light flashed across deep in his eyes.</p> <p>At that moment, Long Yubai’s eyes were misty, his pretty and clean face gorgeously red. Those eyes of his were sparkling with a watery light, and his red, moist lips were half-open.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua was strongly tempted by his charming look, but he still stayed calm.</p> <p>“Promise me that you’ll give me the zombie nucleus later when you’re done,” he lowered his chest and put his lips near Long Yubai’s as he said.</p> <p>His warm and moist breath spread on Long Yubai’s face, making the latter raise his chin to kiss his lips.</p> <p>But, Yang Jianhua slightly raised his face to dodge that kiss. “If you don’t agree, this will end now.”</p> <p>Long Yubai was unable to remain calm at the moment or think as he usually would. In this very moment, he had no choice but to accept any request that Yang Jianhua made.</p> <p>“I get it! I will give it to you!”</p> <p>After hearing that, Yang Jianhua began making intense movements, and both Long Yubai’s body and heart were satisfied immediately.</p> <p>After finishing, Yang Jianhua lied on the bed with his arms around Long Yubai. Meanwhile, Long Yubai, who seemed to be so enamored with him just now, had calmed down already.</p> <p>He leaned against Yang Jianhua’s strong chest and said with a cold and bland look, “Since you want that zombie nucleus so much, I’ll just give it to you. But, there is one condition. You have to destroy this base entirely. You have to tear down the fence wall and burn all the houses in this place, then kill all men, children, and old people in this base. I’ll bring all the women in this base back to Earth Dragon to fulfill the needs of my soldiers. My soldiers are all strong men with needs. They might be driven crazy if we don’t allow them to let it out once in a while.”</p> <p>Hearing Long Yubai’s tone of command, Yang Jianhua didn’t say anything but lowered his head to put his mouth near Long Yubai’s ear and said, “Alright, allow me some time. I’ll sort all the useful things, then destroy the rest.”</p> <p>“How much time do you need? Three days should be enough,” said Long Yubai.</p> <p>Yang Jianhua laughed, “This base is so huge. How can three days be enough?”</p> <p>“I’ll give you seven days then,” said Long Yubai blandly, “Only seven days. You know what to do.”</p> <p>“Alright!” Yang Jianhua blinked and responded.</p> <p>Long Yubai suddenly thought of something else. “Since you’ve failed to kill Lin Qiao’s family,” he said, “I’ll do it myself. Even if they’re under the protection of Sea City Base, nothing can stop me from killing them.”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua paused and then asked, “Why? Do you have to make them die? They’re like homeless dogs now. They are no threat to us anymore, are they?”</p> <p>Long Yubai glanced at him and said, “I just want to prevent all future problems. Since you couldn’t do it, I’ll certainly do it myself.”</p> <p>The look in Yang Jianhua’s eyes changed. He hesitated for a while, then asked, “Are you going to Sea City Base with your people?”</p> <p>Long Yubai turned around with the back of his head to Yang Jianhua and said, “Yes. I hope that you’ll be done with the work here before I return. After that, we’ll go back to the Earth Dragon Base.”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua didn’t notice the murderous intention which had flashed across Long Yubai’s eyes. In fact, Long Yubai only wanted to kill Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>If that woman didn’t exist, Yang Jianhua would have listened to every single word he said.</p>",
  "Chapter 407: Zombies Come Out Of The Bath": "<p>Long Yubai believed that Lin Wenwen was the reason why Yang Jianhua said so much useless words to him. If Yang Jianhua weren’t a good-looking ice-power possessor who had a great body shape and was good at sex, he would never spend so much time on him.</p> <p>So now, he had to gain better control of him. He needed Yang Jianhua to be attracted to him so strongly that he’d actually forget about Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>With that thought, he turned around and put his arms around Yang Jianhua’s neck while speaking, “Is that what you got for today? Are you losing it?”</p> <p>Yang Jianhua started to have other thoughts on hearing Long Yubai say that he would kill Lin Family people himself. So, as the latter tried to seduce him again, he didn’t want to give any response. However, the moment he saw Long Yubai’s charming eyes, his body reacted faster than his brain.</p> <p>…</p> <p>After telling Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen the truth, Lin Qiao spent an hour talking to them. Her mother and sister had roughly told her about all that happened in the recent years.</p> <p>“Mom, about me… don’t tell Lin Feng just yet. He’s busy now. We should let the situation stay natural. We’ll tell him later on when this place starts running stably. ” Lin Qiao looked at Mrs. Lin and said.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin nodded, but then thought for a second and said, “In fact, I think Lin Feng should have guessed it just like we did. He knows you even better than we do, so how could he possibly not discover all these strange things about you?”</p> <p>“Perhaps,” said Lin Qiao, “If he asks, you can tell him.”</p> <p>Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwen nodded.</p> <p>Abruptly, Lin Qiao looked at Lin Wenwen’s hair and said, “Wenwen, why did you cut your hair and start exercising?”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen paused briefly, then glanced at Mrs. Lin. After that, she turned back to Lin Qiao and said, “I just felt that… I relied too much on you and our big brother. You were right last time. I’ve been very dependent on you guys all the time. Someday, you might also be facing dangerous situations as well. I think that even if I wouldn’t be able to help you, I should at least keep myself safe.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her and said with surprise, “How exactly did I spoil you during these years? You didn’t think about that until recently? This is the post-apocalyptic era, and everyone needs to learn to protect themselves. Didn’t you know that before? The person that you’re relying on might fall someday. Relying on yourself is the correct thing to do.”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen lowered her head and responded with a low voice, “Knowing it is one thing, doing it is another. You know that I’ve always been poor at sports.”</p> <p>“You were born with back luck,” Lin Qiao complained, “Ever since you were little, bad things never stopped happening to you. It’s already a miracle for you to survive till now, yet you actually didn’t change at all.”</p> <p>“That’s because you’ve been having Tianxing stay around and protect me,” said Lin Wenwen.</p> <p>“So, it’s my fault?” Lin Qiao popped her eyes.</p> <p>As the two of them seemed to start fighting, Mrs. Lin hurriedly joined the conversation, “Alright, alright, I think she has realized this time how important it is to be able to protect herself. After all, she was kicked out of the base and had to run like a stray dog without your protection.”</p> <p>As her mother helped Wenwen, Lin Qiao gave the latter a glance and gave up on educating her. “Alright, it’s getting late. Mom, Wenwen, you two go downstairs and get some rest.”</p> <p>The two nodded, then stood up and left.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lin Qiao turned and went upstairs to the roof. The group of zombies was still bathing there. She only planned to let them bathe for an hour, but by now, it had been nearly two hours.</p> <p>“Alright, get out, all get out! Your bathing time is up!” Arriving at the roof, Lin Qiao clapped her hands and shouted at those zombies. But, those zombies only looked at her; none of them got up.</p> <p>They didn’t want to!</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over and stood in the middle of their buckets as she shouted again, “Get up! Don’t make me use violence!”</p> <p>This time, her words were threatening, hearing which, those zombies finally reacted. The two level-four zombies quickly stood up, then slowly stepped out of the buckets.</p> <p>As they got out of the water, the other zombies all stood up.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the gasoline bucket and knocked it loudly.</p> <p>Then, she leaned her head forward to look inside the bucket, and saw the crack-mouthed zombie boy staring at her with his head raised. His dark eyes and cracked mouth were all soaked in the water.</p> <p>Lin Qiao flinched as she was startled by the look on his face.</p> <p>After that, she slapped the iron bucket and said, “Get out, get out! You look so scary! Get out and I’ll wrap your face up!”</p> <p>The zombie boy stood up and stuck his head out of the water to look at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took two steps backward, then saw the zombie boy come out of the bucket. She looked around and found his clothes thrown on the ground.</p> <p>She picked up the bandage, then shouted at the female level-four zombie who had already gotten dressed, “Zombie number two, get over here!”</p> <p>The female zombie walked to Lin Qiao and stood beside her, looking at her.</p> <p>“From now on, you’ll be responsible for tying his bandage. Watch me do it, and then you’ll know how,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Roar…” Hearing Lin Qiao say that the level-four zombie would be tying his bandage, the zombie boy opened his mouth wide to give the female zombie a roar with discontentment.</p> <p>The female zombie was frightened by his roar and hurriedly made a few steps backward.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slapped on the back of the zombie boy’s head and said to him, “What are you doing? I told her to do so! Why did you roar at her?”</p> <p>The zombie boy turned around and raised his head to look at Lin Qiao with confusion.</p> <p>While wrapping the bandage on his face, Lin Qiao said, “Do you want me to do this for you every time? Do you know how to do this? You’ll look even worse than a ghost if I let you do it yourself!”</p> <p>“Roar…” The zombie boy protested again.</p> <p>Clap!</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave him another slap and said, “No rejection, or you won’t be able to take a bath again. Do you understand?”</p> <p>Hearing that, the zombie boy immediately quieted down. Only after that did the female zombie slowly came close to him.</p> <p>After wrapping the zombie boy’s face up with the bandage, Lin Qiao turned to check the other zombies’ clothes. They had all put their clothes on, but some of them got their buttons wrong.</p> <p>She walked to them one by one to redo their buttons, then said to them, “Alright, all go back to your territories and guard your places well. You don’t need to come back here until I call you again.”</p> <p>“Go,” She waved a hand at them.</p> <p>The group of zombies immediately turned around, leaped onto the edge of the roof, and darted out.</p> <p>Upon turning back, Lin Qiao speechlessly found the zombie boy who was holding his bucket and wasn’t willing to leave.</p> <p>“Go! Why are you holding the bucket? If you don’t guard your territory well, I won’t even let you drink the water again,” She threatened him.</p> <p>“Roar…” The zombie boy looked at her as he reluctantly let go of the bucket, then turned and hopped onto the stage by the edge of the roof before leaping off the building and disappearing.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked around, feeling that one of those zombies was missing.</p>",
  "Chapter 408: The Asleep Old Man": "<p>She scanned the roof with her eyes, then finally remembered the zombie old man who had dragged his bucket to behind a wall. She walked over, wondering why the zombie old man hadn’t made any response to her shouts yet.</p> <p>She found the answer when she walked up to the bucket and saw the zombie old man. He was still sitting in the bucket, leaning against the bucket edge. Also, he was sleeping!</p> <p>Yes, he was asleep.</p> <p>Lin Qiao got close in shock and found that the zombie old man had closed his eyes and slightly opened his mouth. He was even snoring! His saliva almost streamed down the corners of his mouth.</p> <p><em>‘Are you still a zombie! You’re actually sleeping! Zombies don’t need to rest, do they? Old man, why are you sleeping during the bath? Is this lake water so powerful? </em>‘ Lin Qiao had so many questions.</p> <p>She raised a hand to remove her cosmetic contacts, then carefully observed the changes which were happening inside the zombie old man’s body.</p> <p>She found that the zombie old man’s body had been absorbing the energy in the water very quickly! She saw the dark-green energy endlessly flowing into his body, mixing together with his own energy.</p> <p>She then glanced at the other buckets. The energy contained in the water in the other buckets was only absorbed by less than five percent, but the zombie old man had already absorbed ten percent of the energy in the water in his bucket. He absorbed the energy twice as fast as the other zombies.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found the zombie old man sleeping quite tight. She looked around, picked up a small piece of iron wire from a corner nearby, and then came back to the zombie old man.</p> <p>She then poked the iron wire into one of the zombie old man’s nostrils.</p> <p>“Puff… Ahhhh…” The zombie old man’s entire body suddenly shivered and his nose wrinkled. Next, he let out a series of weird noises.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at him, wanting to laugh. What happened just now? He actually sneezed!</p> <p>“Roar!” Seeing Lin Qiao abruptly, the zombie old man who had woken up gave her a roar unhappily.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood up and said, “Get up, the bath time was over, yet you were still sleeping! Are you sure that you’re a zombie?”</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie old man roared at her again with a frown.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at him with a weird look, then nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll go, I won’t look, alright?”</p> <p>While speaking, she walked to the other side and put the cosmetic contacts back into her eyes. After that, she heard the clattering noise of the water, followed by a short quietness. And then, she heard the noises of the zombie old man dressing himself.</p> <p>Lin Qiao waited for quite a while before the area behind the wall finally quieted down.</p> <p>As she turned back, she saw the zombie old man in a clean suit which was designed in Tang Dynasty’s style. He even brushed his white hair with a hand before he slowly walked to Lin Qiao and stood beside her, seemingly waiting for her to talk.</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly glanced at the zombie old man’s hair which were brushed neatly with water, then said to him, “Alright, this is your bath for today. You go back to your territory and stay there. I’ll call you guys back here for the next bath. Wait for my order.”</p> <p>The zombie old man silently listened to her, then turned around and left swiftly without making even the slightest sound.</p> <p>After watching him leave, Lin Qiao thought for a moment while scratching her chin. She felt that the zombie old man’s vibe was going to make a breakthrough. Was he upgrading soon?</p> <p>Would he be the first zombie to restore his memory? He had lots of human habits, and understood almost everything she said. Or, was all that because he was an old man?</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t spend too much time thinking, but turned and went downstairs. She came to her own room, then entered her space.</p> <p>Right now, she felt that this space was almost exclusive for her. Maybe because Viney was here before, she always felt that the space didn’t really belong to her. After Viney went into her belly, she started to sense a strong connection between herself and the space.</p> <p>At present, she was not only able to sense that the space was run by her own energy, but had also been feeling that every single grass in the space contained the energies from her and the lake.</p> <p>The air in the space was actually from the woods. Those strange trees in the woods had been absorbing the energy from the lake and turning it into a type of air which contained a slight amount of energy.</p> <p><em>‘So that’s how the air in this space is produced.’</em></p> <p>She didn’t know that until now. No wonder every plant in that space contained energy.</p> <p>She walked to the small building which was put into the space by her earlier. She put the building next to the few small spaces, on a clearing which had no furniture pieces.</p> <p>She opened the front door of the building. The door on the first floor was huge, about two-meters and thirty centimeters tall, divided into four parts.</p> <p>She was able to drag the couches and some other things into the building by herself, but the beds and wooden closets might be a little tricky. She was strong enough to move those furniture pieces, but they might end up bumping into the walls or something else.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then decided to ask Xie Dong for help.</p> <p>With that thought, she exited her space and jumped directly into action. First, she walked to Xie Dong’s door and knocked on it. She waited for two minutes, and then Xie Dong opened the door. He was wearing a loose-fitting bathrobe.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood at the door and spent a moment observing his bathrobe, then said, “Put your pants on. I need you to help me move some furniture.”</p> <p>Xie Dong paused for a second. Maybe because he had bathed in the lake water for two hours, he was feeling better now, and his vibe was not as down as before.</p> <p>He nodded, then turned and walked back into his room. In a few minutes, he showed up again with a pair of jeans, his upper body bared.</p> <p>Lin Qiao held his arm and brought him into the space.</p> <p>Once in, Xie Dong gave a glance at the small building with surprise, as it was new in this place.</p> <p>“I asked Yuan Tianxing to get this out for me today. I put it in here, and I’m gonna put some furniture pieces inside. From now on, this is kinda my home,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>While speaking, she walked to a bed, then waved at Xie Dong and said, “Let’s carry this bed up first.”</p> <p>After that, the two of them spent the whole night lifting furniture. Thankfully, they were both zombies who wouldn’t get tired.</p> <p>The next afternoon, Lin Qiao went to the lobby of the hotel, only finding Lin Wenwen and some other girls sitting on the couches. Lin Feng and the others who should be having a meeting there were absent.</p> <p>She quickly used her sensations and found that those people were in a room on the second floor.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao coming downstairs, Lin Wenwen said to her, “Miss. Lu, my brother and the others are expecting you in the meeting room on the second floor.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded knowingly, then turned and went to the second floor, following those people’s scents to the meeting room. The soldier who was guarding the meeting room opened the door for her before she had even arrived.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked in and saw Lin Feng, Yuan Tianxing and Chen Yuting.</p> <p>She somehow felt that she was falling into disadvantages, as there were three human beings, but only one zombie in this room. Should she bring Qiu Lili next time? Qiu Lili wouldn’t want to be here, as she would not understand what they were about to say.</p> <p>Should she bring Liu Jun? Liu Jun would understand the contents of the meeting, but she was too weak to boost the vibe of zombies.</p> <p>There was a two-meters-long, large conference table in the meeting room. Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing were sitting in front of each other, Chen Yuting was sitting on the other side of the table alone, and the empty seat was clearly saved for Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Please have a seat!” Yuan Tianxing pointed at the empty seat and said.</p>",
  "Chapter 409: The Land for Farming": "<p>Lin Qiao walked to the empty seat and sat down. Some files were already placed on the table before her. She conveniently opened the files and browsed, finding that those were some maps and constructional drawings.</p> <p>While reading the files, she waited for the three guys to start talking.</p> <p>Yuan Tianxing stood up and took over the map which was held in the hands of Lin Yu who stood by his side, then spread it on the table. He pointed at the construction site on the map and brought up some problems, then they started a discussion.</p> <p>The building materials used in the construction site were from the old buildings nearby. Those buildings were torn down, and the bricks were sorted for reuse. People had searched through all cement factories in the Upper City District and found some cement, but it was still not enough.</p> <p>“I’ll collect the materials,” said Lin Qiao, “You only need to build up the fence wall. I’m just thinking about sweeping across the entire Upper City District for supplies. Constructional materials will be my number one target. I’ll also look for food and other daily supplies.”</p> <p>“Thank you!” said Yuan Tianxing.</p> <p>Lin Qiao then asked a question, “Did any of our people major in agriculture? The food that we have now can last us for long, and we’re able to collect more. But, we can also develop our own land for farming.”</p> <p>“But the soil is not good enough to grow crops,” said Lin Feng, “Most of the lands in the world have been infected by the virus. How are we supposed to grow food?”</p> <p>“If we water the crops with the water from my space, the virus will be suppressed,” said Lin Qiao, “It can’t purify the soil, but will purify the plants.”</p> <p>“Really?” Both Lin Feng and Yuan Tianxing had their eyes glowed, “In that case, we can find some people to cultivate crops. But… we don’t have seeds, do we?”</p> <p>“I have some seeds,” said Lin Qiao, “I have the seeds of many vegetables, but not grains. I hope I’ll be lucky enough to collect some other seeds.”</p> <p>“If you’re able to solve the soil problem, we’ll learn to grow our own food,” said Yuan Tianxing, “People don’t have to major in agriculture to do that. They’ll know how to do it as long as they can understand some relevant books.”</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>The meeting lasted for two or three hours; they talked while pointing at the map the whole time.</p> <p>In Sea City Base, Wu Chengyue called a large meeting to tell the commoners who were able to work to go to the new base site in Hangzhou City to find jobs if they wanted to earn some food to get through the coming winter.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing’s stand was soon crowded. Every single day, there was a line of people waiting there to put their names on the list of workers. However, Wu Chengyue made a rule that the superpowered people at level-two and above weren’t allowed to apply for the jobs in the new base.</p> <p>After all, the superpowered people at level-two and above were already capable enough to kill zombies and harvest nuclei.</p> <p>However, some people would rather carry bricks than kill zombies.</p> <p>Killing zombies was so dangerous! Why wouldn’t they take the brick-carrying job while there was a chance?</p> <p>Before long, Wu Chengyue had sent a truck-full of people to Upper City District. Meanwhile, he left for Jiaxing City with hundreds of people. This time, he didn’t bring Meng Yue or Xiao Yunlong.</p> <p>He brought Wu Yueling, Xiao Licheng, and the other five superpowered squad leaders, who were all at level-five.</p> <p>Ever since he honestly told Meng Yue about his true feelings that day, the latter had been avoiding him even during the working time. She always asked Xiao Yunlong to deliver files or messages to him.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue understood how she felt, so he let her do what she wanted.</p> <p>It was nearly the end of October. The farming work had stopped temporarily, so Lu Tianyi, who was working in the Agriculture Department, had some free time. He heard that Wu Chengyue was going to send another batch of people to the new base in Upper City District, and decided to follow them there.</p> <p>This time, his best friend, Kong Qingming, didn’t go with him; his intelligence work had been keeping him pretty busy.</p> <p>Lu Tianyi, Huang Shou, Zheng Xiaonian, and the other few didn’t officially join those workers, but made their trip a mission. They directly exited the base, then headed toward the Upper City District.</p> <p>Chief Wu only forbade high-leveled superpowered people from working in the new base, but didn’t say that they couldn’t pay a visit to that place!</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was sitting in the car; this time, another soldier was driving. Xiao Licheng looked back at him from the front seat and said, “Miss. Lu has returned to Upper City District. Chief, aren’t you going there?”</p> <p>Wu Chengyue’s people spotted Lin Qiao not long after she left Sea City Base. The car she was driving was very eye-catching, so it was pretty hard for her to avoid being found.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue shook his head and said, “No rush! I’ll find the air base in Jiaxing first. After achieving our goal, I’ll visit her and see how the construction work of her new base is going. We’re not going there for now.”</p> <p>“Is the air base really in Jiaxing?” asked Xiao Licheng.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue responded with a smile, “There is an air base. I’ve checked long ago. I just didn’t tell anyone about it before, as Yang Chao was with us.”</p> <p>Xiao Licheng turned his head back.</p> <p>Earlier on, Wu Chengyue asked him to figure out Miss. Lu’s whereabouts. Now, they knew where she was, but weren’t going to find her. He just didn’t understand what his Chief had been thinking.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue was feeling strange as well. The person that he wanted to marry turned out to be the one who had kidnapped Ling Ling and raped him. He thought about that over and over again, and couldn’t stop feeling unhappy about it.</p> <p>However, he had given his word and made his decision, so he would not regret. Since he had promised to marry her, he would do it.</p> <p>Suddenly, he wanted to know what expression she would wear when she learned that he had decided to marry her. Also, he was still very confused by how drastically that female zombie’s personality had changed.</p> <p>Without makeup, he actually failed to recognize her. How thick was her makeup before?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue tried to remember, but found that the old Lu Tianyu’s face had already faded in his mind. What had been flashing across his mind was either a scarred face with disheveled hair, or a woman wearing a hat and sunglasses.</p> <p>What he could remember the most clearly was the delicate face which was held in his arms.</p> <p>Wu Chengyue didn’t hate Lu Tianyu the zombie for her personality. Even though he didn’t love it, he was interested in it.</p> <p>At that moment, Wu Yueling who sat beside him pulled his sleeve. Wu Chengyue turned and found her holding the grass dragonfly high, looking at him with her large eyes.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?”</p> <p>Wu Yueling raised the grass dragonfly to before his eyes. Right then, Wu Chengyue noticed that the grass dragonfly had started getting loose. Some grass leaves had fallen out, looking like some extra feet of the dragonfly.</p> <p>He took it over and tried to put those grass leaves back in. After spending a while trying, he found that he wasn’t able to make the grass dragonfly look exactly the same as before. Even though he did put those leaves back in, the dragonfly still looked weird.</p> <p>Wu Yueling looked at the grass dragonfly in her father’s hands, her face filled with confusion. Wu Chengyue spent some efforts on the grass dragonfly, then handed it back to Wu her</p> <p>As a result, Wu Yueling glanced at it with dislike, then pushed it back into his hands.</p> <p>“Daddy doesn’t know how to fix this. It can only stay this way. Maybe, when you see her next time, you can ask her to make you another one. What do you think? Shall we ask her to make you a larger and prettier one?” Wu Chengyue smiled to comfort the little girl.</p> <p>Wu Yueling gave him a glance, then looked at the grass dragonfly in his hand. After a short hesitation, she finally raised a little hand to take it over.</p>",
  "Chapter 410: The Second Batch Of Workers": "<p>The second batch of workers from Sea City Base were all frightened when they saw the zombie crowd around the new base site on their way driving there.</p> <p>Countless zombies crowded on the road, jamming the entire area.</p> <p>“Why… Why are there so many zombies?”</p> <p>“Oh my! What if they found us? What should we do? If they all charge at us, we’d be eaten!”</p> <p>The workers stopped their vehicle about thirty meters from the zombie crowd and all panicked.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei, who was hiding among the workers, also fixed his eyes on the zombie crowd in shock.</p> <p>The zombies had turned their heads to the vehicle when they heard the noises from it. Sensing the strong human scent, the zombies all became agitated.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>The zombies roared at the humans as they reached their arms and bared their teeth toward them. But strangely, they didn’t make even a step to approach those humans.</p> <p>“Drive back! We’re not going! Are you feeding us to zombies!” Huang Tianfe burst in yells.</p> <p>He pulled some strings to conceal his identity as a level-five superpowered man and made his way into the worker group.</p> <p>After confirming that those Hades Base people were really building a new base in this area, Wu Chengyu felt that this was a really good opportunity for the commoners who didn’t dare to venture to leave the base to kill zombies.</p> <p>He set a power level limit for the applicants, because he didn’t want the higher-leveled people, who were capable enough to go out of the base to hunt zombies and trade for food with zombie nuclei, to take the opportunities of survival which should belong to the commoners.</p> <p>The new base made great offers. The people who worked there would be provided with food and good payments, but only needed to do some construction work. Anyone would want a job like that.</p> <p>However, the power-level limit that Wu Chengyue set disappointed the higher-leveled people. Without a doubt, many people would follow this rule, but there were some who decided not to. For example, the ones who liked to reap what they hadn’t sown.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei was one of them. He secretly pulled strings to conceal his true power level. So now, he was one of those workers, as a level-two superpowered man.</p> <p>At this time, the hundreds of zombies which were crowding before his eyes scared him and made him want to run. He regretted, feeling that he should never have come here. He now believed that the others were all deceived.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei pointed at those soldiers who were there to protect the workers and yelled, “They lied to us! There must be some kind of experimental base in this place! This is not a survivors base! They brought us here to do experiments on us, like what Yang Chao did before!”</p> <p>Those soldiers who guarded behind and around the vehicle made no reaction to Huang Tianfei’s accusation, as if they didn’t hear him at all.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing got out of the driver’s seat and stood before the vehicle as he said to the people in it, “Everyone calm down. We are heading to a survivors base. These zombies, look at them, they won’t hurt people. Look at them closely. They are not moving.”</p> <p>While speaking, he raised a hand to point at the zombie crowd.</p> <p>“How can they possibly not hurt people? All zombies eat human beings! Do you think we have never seen zombies? Do you think that we’re stupid?” Huang Tianfei shouted at Du Yuanxing as he refused to accept the latter’s explanation.</p> <p>“Yeah, how can any zombie not eat human being! Look at them! They’re brandishing their teeth and claws! They’re coming at us! Just drive away! Why are you still talking here?” Someone agreed with Huang Tianfei.</p> <p>Most of those people were commoners who had no fighting capacity. They all panicked upon seeing the zombies. They found Huang Tianfei’s words making sense, so they all decided to take his side.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing looked at those people, then abruptly crossed his arms and smiled, “Alright, I’ll let you go back. However, are you sure that you’d be able to survive the coming winter if I sent you back? If you’re willing to follow me in, get off the car right now and I’ll guide you in. I assure you that these zombies won’t even approach you. But, if you decide to stay in the truck, you will not be allowed in later.”</p> <p>Many people from the slums would die every winter after the apocalypse. It was hard for the old, sick, and disabled people to survive a winter with all the starvation and coldness.</p> <p>Therefore, every spring when the weather started to get warm, each base would ship out a batch of corpses.</p> <p>Winter served as a cleaner to clean the people with low survivability out of the bases.</p> <p>As Du Yuanxing mentioned winter, some of the people in the truck quieted down. As commoners, they deeply understood how cruel and terrifying winter could be.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing continued, “Don’t you believe in your Chief? How could he ever try to harm you? Even if he wanted to get rid of you, he wouldn’t need to make this so complicated, would he? Also, only a pervert like Yang Chao can come up with the idea of that kind of an experiment. Do you think your Chief Wu and Chief Zou are men like that?”</p> <p><em>‘No,’ </em>those people answered that question silently. They didn’t say any word out, but the looks on their faces spoke for them.</p> <p>“Eh… You may know a person’s face but not his mind! Yang Chao seemed to be fine before we found out about what he did, isn’t that true?” As the others were swayed, Huang Tianfei couldn’t help but start talking again. In fact, he was already much less confident than before.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing glanced at him and found that he was hiding behind the others.</p> <p>He blinked, then turned and made two steps forward. After that, he turned around and stood before the car as he looked at those people.</p> <p>“I’m gonna say this one more time. All who want food and quilts get out and follow me in. For the ones who decide not to come, I won’t force you. I’ll let the soldiers send you back.”</p> <p>The people started glancing at each other. Soon, some of them got off the truck.</p> <p>Those people didn’t take part in the conversation. They had all noticed that those zombies were really not moving. Even though they had all been baring their teeth and showing their claws, none of them made one single step toward this area.</p> <p>When Du Yuanxing was talking, those zombies stayed where they were.</p> <p>As some people got off the vehicle, the rest of the people who had hesitations were flustered. They didn’t want to risk their lives, but did fear the cold winter.</p> <p>“We… We trust Chief Wu!” At last, these people gritted their teeth and jumped off the truck.</p> <p>Before long, they all stood by Du Yuanxing’s side, staring at the zombie crowd with fear, not even daring to talk.</p> <p>Soon, only about eight workers were left on the truck; Huang Tianfei was one of them.</p> <p>He looked around, then spent a while observing the zombie crowd and found that those zombies did really not come close to the truck.</p> <p>And then, he slowly followed the others out of the vehicle.</p>",
  "Chapter 411: A Group Of Fake Zombies": "<p>Du Yuanxing was talking pretty calmly, but in fact, he wasn’t so confident.</p> <p><em>‘Damn! Bosses! Please show up! I’m gonna lose it!’</em></p> <p>Looking at those crowded zombies which had barred the road, Du Yuanxing did not know what to do. However, he couldn’t show those workers how panicked he was, or they wouldn’t believe him.</p> <p>As all the workers got off the truck, Du Yuanxing glanced at them, then made a step toward those zombies. Seeing him heading toward the most dangerous area, those workers who had the courage to get off the truck now didn’t dare to follow him forward.</p> <p>While walking, Du Yuanxing murmured silently, “Someone please come here to control these zombies. Didn’t you say that someone will walk us in once we arrive? Where is that person? No, I mean, where is that zombie?’</p> <p>The closer he got to those zombies, the more unsure he was.</p> <p>The group of workers stood before the truck, quietly watching him while waiting for the zombie crowd to respond.</p> <p>Right at that moment, a zombie roar was heard from a distance away. The owner of that voice must have used its superpower to send its voice to this far.</p> <p>Hearing that roar, Du Yuanxing finally sighed with relief. He stopped walking and stood on the middle of the road, looking at the zombie crowd with anticipation.</p> <p>Then, a little body whose face was entirely covered in bandage slowly walked out of the crowd. People couldn’t see his face, only a purely dark pair of eyes which were glowing with a weird red light. Judging by the height, he was about ten years old.</p> <p>His eyes clearly told everybody that he was not a human being.</p> <p>The zombie boy calmly walked up to the front and stared at Du Yuanxing and the others.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing hadn’t met Lin Qiao’s zombie leader squad, so he didn’t know the zombie boy. However, judging by the way he was standing before the zombie crowd, those zombies seemed to be under his control.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei was on alert when he saw that zombie boy. He recognized the zombie boy as a zombie leader, which was powerful enough to tear everyone on the scene into pieces.</p> <p>Facing a zombie leader, he had no other choice but to run. The people who were around him shared the same feeling with him.</p> <p>The people who were persuaded by Du Yuanxing earlier were all commoners. They were almost failing to survive back in the base. They had no skills, and no one wanted their labor. So, they came here and didn’t want to go back with empty hands. The desire of living made them believe that what Du Yuanxing said was true.</p> <p>The zombie boy spent about ten seconds watching them quietly, then turned to give the zombie crowd a roar.</p> <p>“Roar!”</p> <p>After that, Du Yuanxing and the others saw those zombies which hadn’t moved at all start to step aside and make a path.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei and the others watched all of that in shock; some of them couldn’t even react.</p> <p>What was happening? Why on earth were those zombies making a path for them? They had the road jammed just a minute ago; but now, they moved away as that zombie boy had given a roar. What did that mean?</p> <p>At that point, the boy zombie sprung up and hopped onto the roof of the truck which was behind those people.</p> <p>Bang! He landed heavily on the truck roof.</p> <p>The driver and the soldiers who were still on the truck all jumped out with fear, stepping as far away from the truck as possible.</p> <p>The zombie boy stood on the truck roof and sniffed around, then leaned his head toward the group of workers and made a few deep gasps. After that, he stayed on the truck roof, eying them greedily.</p> <p>Those workers raised their heads to look at the boy zombie with fright, worrying that it might suddenly pounce on them. The ones who managed to stand still all had strong minds.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing glanced at the zombie boy, then at the path, and then at the truck under the zombie boy’s feet. After that, he gave up on the idea of getting back into the vehicle.</p> <p>“Um… Now there is a way. Let’s just get in, in case these zombies regret,” he said while moving forward.</p> <p>The others followed behind him with hesitation. They were all reluctant, but still followed Du Yuanxing closely. He was a level-five superpowered man after all. Staying close to him made those commoners feel safe.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei and the other few silently followed behind those people. They were actually at high levels, but the others had no idea about that.</p> <p>Among all these people, Huang Tianfei’s level was the highest. The other relatively higher-leveled ones had sensed that, so they quietly followed him.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie boy suddenly gave them a roar from the truck roof, probably because he wasn’t happy about how slow those people were. Those people trembled with fear, then turned around to find that the zombie boy had leaped off the truck, slowly following behind them step by step.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei and the others quickly ran forward, pushed aside some commoners, and squeezed into the worker group. While following Du Yuanxing forward, they fixed their eyes on the zombie boy.</p> <p>Those commoners who were pushed to the end of the group were so afraid. However, Huang Tianfei’s clean clothes told them that they shouldn’t offend him.</p> <p>Therefore, they brought up the rear, or more specifically, served as human shields with a very strong fear.</p> <p>“Move faster! He thinks that you’re too slow,” Du Yuanxing glanced back at the zombie boy while walking forward in big steps. Then, he thought for a second and said to the others.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie boy gave another roar, seemingly to respond to him.</p> <p>Soon, they easily passed through the area which was jammed by zombies.</p> <p>As they got through, the zombie boy again roared out loud. Following his voice, the zombie crowd gathered again in the middle of the road.</p> <p>Still, their eyes were fixed on that group of workers who had just passed through.</p> <p>As those workers entered the new base site, the zombie boy turned and hopped back onto the truck roof, then leaped on top of the building nearby and disappeared.</p> <p>After coming in, Du Yuanxing gave a sigh with relief.</p> <p>“How far do we have to walk? Will there be more zombies on our way?” Huang Tianfei moved to the front of the group and followed behind Du Yuanxing as he asked. His tone of speaking was unfriendly, as if Du Yuanxing owed him something.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing glanced at him, then responded blandly while moving, “Just a couple of more miles.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing’s cold attitude made Huang Tianfei feel annoyed. However, he didn’t say anything, but gave the former a cold glance while silently moving forward with the others.</p> <p>“Those zombies you just saw were driven out of the city by us, so this city is now zombie-free, very safe,” said Du Yuanxing.</p> <p>At that point, the people who had just safely passed through a zombie crowd were doubting the entire world.</p> <p>What did they see? Those zombies didn’t eat them, but made a path for them! They made a path! Had they just encountered a group of fake zombies?</p>",
  "Chapter 412: The Scum Shows Up": "<p>On the other side, Lin Qiao, Qiu Lili, Xie Dong and Shen Yujen were sweeping across the Upper City District. From a roof, she suddenly sensed Du Yuanxing’s vibe from Sea City Base, along with a series of weak and disordered vibes. So, she guessed that the second batch of workers had arrived.</p> <p>Therefore, she gave the zombie boy a roar and told her to let them in.</p> <p>“Who’s here?” Qiu Lili stood by her side and looked in that direction with curiosity as she asked.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her and replied, “Can’t you sense that vibe from there? It’s Du Yuanxing. He brought quite some people here. There should be a truck-full of them.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili made a deep breath toward that direction, then said, “I can’t grasp the scents from that far away. The vibes that I sensed are all mixed together.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “It’s them. I think the second batch of workers have arrived. This is strange though. Why did they come so soon?”</p> <p>Before, they could only hire two or three people a day. Someone applied for the job, but eventually decided not to come.</p> <p>Qiu Lili didn’t know about that, so she looked at Lin Qiao and asked, “It’s been about ten days since the first batch of workers arrived. Is this too soon?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded, then turned and jumped off the building. She had sensed the scent of food.</p> <p>She was able to sense the scent of rice from a very long distance away, so by relying on her sense of smell, she found quite a few supermarkets and large hotels, including some grocery shops in the markets.</p> <p>Lin Hao and his people had searched through the area around the hotel, so she went further away to look for more supplies.</p> <p>Her extra sharp sense of smell helped her to locate many supplies. By the time she and her zombie friends searched across half of the Upper City District, rice in bags or buckets had piled into hills inside her space.</p> <p>She was way faster than human beings. In a few days, half of all the stored food in Upper City District were found by her.</p> <p>A couple of hours later, Lin Qiao, Qiu Lili, Xie Dong, and Shen Yujen returned to the hotel. Lin Qiao and Qiu Lili directly leaped into the hotel from a building nearby while Xie Dong and Shen Yujen took the stairs.</p> <p>Both looked exactly like healthy human beings, so no one in the lobby noticed them when they came in. However, Xie Dong spotted Huang Tianfei from the group of workers. He paused briefly, his eyes showing a fierce look. After that, he kept moving toward the stairs.</p> <p>Shen Yujen who followed behind Xie Dong gave him a glance with surprise, as she had sensed that his vibe somehow changed for a moment.</p> <p>“From now on, this is your dormitory. Later on, our people will arrange rooms for you. The canteen is over there. You’ll get three meals a day,” Lin Feng stood by the front desk. The people who were brought here by Du Yuanxing were now standing in the lobby, facing him.</p> <p>They looked around with surprise. None of them expected that they would be able to live in a hotel!</p> <p>“Is it real that we only need to build a fence wall? Like, carry bricks and do the other constructional work?” some people asked with doubts.</p> <p>“Yes,” said Lin Feng, “Tomorrow morning, eight o’clock, I’ll take you to the construction site. It’s not far away from here.</p> <p>At that moment, Lin Wenwen, Cheng Wangxue, and the two kids came in from the outside. They were all surprised when they saw all those people in the lobby.</p> <p>Liu Jun came in along with them. Once in, she had her eyes fixed on Huang Tianfei, who was staring at her in shock.</p> <p>Liu Jun frowned as she held Tongtong’s hand and quickly walked toward the stairs.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei was stunned. His eyes followed Liu Jun, showing disbelief. Automatically, he came out of the crowd and followed behind her.</p> <p>“Liu Jun! It’s really you! And Tongtong!”</p> <p>Liu Jun kept walking straight forward, as if she didn’t hear his words. Only Tongtong turned back to look at Huang Tianfei with curiosity.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei caught up with them and dragged Tongtong’s arm.</p> <p>“Liu Jun, where are you going!” He yelled at her with discontentment.</p> <p>His voice attracted the attention of Lin Wenwen and the others in the lobby. They all turned to Liu Jun and him with curiosity.</p> <p>“Whaaaaa…” Tongtong took fright when Huang Tianfei dragged him violently and yelled, so the boy burst in tears.</p> <p>Liu Jun stopped walking as he caught Tongtong.</p> <p>She hurriedly turned around, then squatted to scoop up her son. However, Huang Tianfei suddenly pulled the boy and violently dragged him behind.</p> <p>“Huang Tianfei, give Tongtong back to me!” Liu Jun stood up, staring at Huang Tianfei with a pair of purely black eyes.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei finally noticed that she had no white parts in her eyes, nor pupils. Those eyes of hers were completely black.</p> <p>He pointed at her eyes in shock and asked, “What… what happened to your eyes!”</p> <p>“Whaaa…” Tongtong cried out loud behind him, but Huang Tianfei ignored the boy.</p> <p>“Huang Tianfei, let go of Tongtong and then get out of here! Otherwise, don’t blame me for showing no mercy!”</p> <p>An icy-cold murderous intent sparkled in her eyes.</p> <p>The others had figured that something was wrong. They acted like a couple who were having a fight, so the others didn’t rashly step up to try and make peace between them.</p> <p>“Tongtong is crying… Grandma, he’s scared,” Lin Xiaolu abruptly held Mrs. Lin’s hand and said to her.</p> <p>Tongtong was crying indeed. At that moment, all the others were looking at Liu Jun and Huang Tianfei silently.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin wasn’t happy about what Huang Tianfei just did. So, she said to him, “Whatever happened between you two, it has nothing to do with the boy. Let go of Tongtong. You scared him. Are you his father?”</p> <p>Huang Tianfei turned to find that it was a middle-aged woman who accused him. Instantly, he got angry.</p> <p>“Old lady, mind your own business…”</p> <p>Before he finished, Liu Jun slapped him heavily on the face.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei paused for a few seconds with his head slightly tilted, then realized what just happened. With disbelief, he glared at Liu Jun and said, “You b*tch! How dare you slap me!”</p> <p>“Huang Tianfei,” said Liu Jun, “Since you abandoned Tongtong and me a couple of months ago, we have nothing to do with you anymore. Why did you come to me? Tongtong is mine. He has nothing to do with you now. Let go of my Tongtong.”</p> <p>In fact, Huang Tianfei was really surprised when he saw Tongtong, because in Sea City Base, every family with kids would be given with living allowance.</p> <p>For that reason, he wanted to bring Tongtong back to Sea City Base the moment he saw him.</p> <p>However, seeing Liu Jun’s eyes stunned him a little.</p> <p>He pointed at Liu Jun and yelled, “Look at what you are. Can you raise Tongtong safely? I am Tongtong’s father. I have the guardianship!”</p> <p>“Guardianship my a*s. This is the post-apocalyptic era. Do you think that you’re still living in the peaceful world before the apocalypse?” said Lin Wenwen with a cold voice.</p>",
  "Chapter 413: Do You Want Him Dead?": "<p>Liu Jun stared at him coldly and said, “No matter what I have become, Tongtong is safe and healthy, and will stay safe and healthy! He is no longer your son. You abandoned him for your own safety, so how dare you demand his guardianship! Get away from us!”</p> <p>Hearing her words, all the others understood what happened. It turned out that the man had abandoned the mother and the son in a dangerous time, and ran for his own life.</p> <p>As a man who abandoned his wife and son in a dangerous situation, he was already disgusting. Now, he treated them with such a bad attitude as he saw them again.</p> <p>He didn’t seem to love his son at all. He was a total scum!</p> <p>Huang Tianfei popped his eyes with anger and cursed Liu Jun, “B*tch, you want to have our son for your own, don’t you? As long as I’m still alive, he is my son! He has my blood! How dare you hit me! We haven’t seen each other for a couple of months. Have you become so bold already?”</p> <p>While speaking, he abruptly raised an arm to slap Liu Jun on the face. But, someone swiftly gripped his wrist.</p> <p>Lin Feng stood behind him and said expressionlessly, “I don’t mind that you were rude to my mother, but I cannot allow you to bully a woman and a child in this place.”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing who was standing by Lin Feng’s side added with a loud voice, “You need Miss. Lu’s permission to take Tongtong away. However, I don’t think she’ll let someone like you take that boy away.”</p> <p>“Ah, you… Why didn’t you stay in your base with that married woman who you’ve hooked up with? Did you come here to die? I regretted last time as I only stripped you and threw you on the hallway. It’s such a surprise that you brought yourself here, hehe…” Lin Qiao’s voice was heard from the stairs.</p> <p>Following a series of footsteps, Lin Qiao, Qiu Lili, Xie Dong and Shen Yujen came downstairs.</p> <p>“Whooo… it hurts… Mom…” Huang Tianfei gripped Tongtong so hard that the boy felt hurt and cried even louder.</p> <p>“Who are you! It’s none of your business! And you! Be quiet!” Huang Tianfei shouted at Lin Qiao, then suddenly turned to hit Tongtong.</p> <p>However, a white figure swiftly showed up behind Tongtong and slapped away Huang Tianfei’s arm. Meanwhile, Qiu Lili gripped his other hand which was holding Tongtong, and then a beam of red light flashed across.</p> <p>“Ou…” Huang Tianfei suddenly burst in howls. He held his right hand with his left hand and made a few quick steps backward with a bitter face.</p> <p>Qiu Lili gave Tongtong back to Liu Jun, then shielded both of them behind her. She pointed at Huang Tianfei and said, “Tongtong is no longer your son since you abandoned him out there. Don’t be shameless. Stay away from them, or I’ll break your legs.”</p> <p>Liu Jun quickly scooped Tongtong up and avoided Huang Tianfei as she ran up behind Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei glanced at his wrist which now had a circle of burn mark on it, then glared at Qiu Lili and yelled, “What did you just do to me? I’m telling you that I can f**k a girl like you to death very easily!”</p> <p>Qiu Lili’s red eyes instantly turned even redder. She abruptly swung an arm and sent a small and sharp gust of wind toward Huang Tianfei’s mouth.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>“Ou-ch…”Huang Tianfei immediately covered his mouth with his hand. Blood dripped down from between his fingers as he widened his eyes, staring at Qiu Lili with disbelief.</p> <p>Qiu Lili didn’t look at him, but said to Liu Jun, “I don’t want to hear him talk, so I cut his mouth. Junjun, are you fine with it?”</p> <p>Liu Jun looked at Huang Tianfei with a frosty gaze as she responded, “I’m fine with it. Lili, if you kill him, it would be even better.”</p> <p>“I don’t kill people. Go and ask Qiaoqiao to do it,” said Qiu Lili. Then, she pouted and turned to stand behind Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Liu Jun and asked her, “Do you want him dead? Do you need my help?”</p> <p>Liu Jun shook her head at Lin Qiao, then turned to say to Huang Tianfei, “You better get out of here now, as I don’t want to kill now. Don’t ever let me see you again.”</p> <p>“He’ll take revenge upon you if you let him leave,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“This time, I’ll let him go to thank him for taking care of me back in Hades Base. From this day on, I owe him nothing,” said Liu Jun. After saying that, she carried Tongtong, turned and walked upstairs.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at Huang Tianfei and said to him, “Go. Tongtong has nothing to do with you anymore. Go find your woman and have another child. Ugh, didn’t you steal Xie Dong’s woman? You also usurped his apartment and tried to put him in jail, right? Let me tell you something. Today, I won’t hurt you, but you should never let me see you again.”</p> <p>Then, she glanced at Du Yuanxing and continued, “We can’t afford to hire this worker. Send him back to Sea City Base.”</p> <p>“Yes,” Du Yuanxing nodded and replied. After that, he immediately walked toward Huang Tianfei, held his arm, and dragged him toward the outside.</p> <p>Huang Tianfei’s eyes were now showing anger and hatred. He stared at Liu Jun who was leaving; his wounded lips were giving him real pain.</p> <p>At this point, as Du Yuanxing dragged him, he exploded with rage.</p> <p>“Ah!” He suddenly pushed Du Yuanxing away, then released a strong gust of wind. Soon, the wind turned as sharp as a blade and spread in the lobby.</p> <p>The blustery wind swept across the entire lobby within a blink of an eye. The others all stepped backward, but still, many commoners were injured by the wind blades.</p> <p>Du Yuanxing quickly squatted and pressed a hand on the ground. Following his moves, a wave of electric currents sizzled into Huang Tianfei’s body from the floor.</p> <p>Being struck by electricity, Huang Tianfei’s entire body twitched, and then fell to the floor stiffly.</p> <p>“Mom, are you hurt?”</p> <p>Huang Tianfei’s attack was unexpectedly sudden and fierce. When the wind started to blow, Lin Wenwen embraced Mrs. Lin and squatted, shielding her mother in her arms.</p> <p>However, a deep wound was left on her own face.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin raised her head to look at Lin Wenwen’s face, saying in shock, “I’m fine… Wenwen, your face!”</p> <p>Lin Wenwen raised a hand to touch her face, then immediately bared her teeth and gasped in pain, “Ouch… It hurts so much!”</p> <p>After that, she put down her hand and saw the blood on it. Nevertheless, she didn’t care much about that, but hurriedly checked on Mrs. Lin.</p> <p>Mrs. Lin shook her head and said, “I’m okay. Go and treat the wound on your face now, or it might leave a scar.”</p> <p>She looked around and found that many of the others had fallen to the floor because of the wind. Some of them had blood on their shirts, as both their clothes and skins were cut broken.</p> <p>After that, Mrs. Lin helped Lin Wenwen up.</p>",
  "Chapter 414: Hunt In Mount Wu": "<p>Lin Wenwen gave a few more glances at Mrs. Lin and Lin Wenwe. After making sure that both of them were fine, she turned to say to Du Yuanxing, “Get him out, or I might accidentally destroy him!”</p> <p>Du Yuanxing walked to Huang Tianfei, who was still lying on the ground and twisting, and said, “He’s at level-five at least. He actually got in.”</p> <p>“What do you mean?” asked Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Well, Chief Wu gathered this batch of people. To ensure an opportunity of survival for these commoners, he forbade the superpowered people at level-two or above to apply for the jobs here. I’m surprised that this man actually got in. Maybe there’re others like him.”</p> <p>While speaking, he gave Huang Tianfei a kick. The latter was twitching stiffly, yet his eyes were rolling quickly.</p> <p>“As a human being, you should have a conscience. Otherwise, you’ll die miserably,” Du Yuanxing said to him. After that, he bent over, grabbed Huang Tianfei’s jacket, and dragged him outside.</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at Lin Wenwen again. Her face was hurt, yet she didn’t seem to care about that. Unlike her, Mrs. Lin seemed to care a lot.</p> <p><em>‘That scum actually came here. What a coincidence! </em>‘ thought Lin Qiao. But soon, she started thinking about what Du Yuanxing just said.</p> <p>Chief Wu gathered this batch of people? What did that mean? What did Wu Chengyue do? And, why did he do that?</p> <p>He sent the first batch of workers as a payback to Lin Qiao for saving Ling Ling’s life. But, what about the second batch? What reason did he have to help Lin Qiao further?</p> <p>Lin Qiao couldn’t figure it out, so she turned and went back upstairs.</p> <p>Earlier on, she grasped a familiar scent from upstairs, so she came down with curiosity to see what happened. To her surprise, she saw that scum trying to take Tongtong away in front of so many people.</p> <p>Upstairs, she went to Liu Jun’s room and found that the latter was checking Tongtong’s arm. Tongtong’s wrist which was finally not scrawny anymore was now very red, even a little bruised.</p> <p>The little boy was sitting on the bed and crying.</p> <p>Lin Qiao frowned slightly and said, “That b*stard really doesn’t care about the kid’s feelings. How did you end up with a guy like that?”</p> <p>Liu Jun dropped her eyelids and sighed, “He saved my life once, and helped me a lot. I thought that he was a good guy. However, after we got together, he began to show his ugly nature. But at that time, it was already too late for me to regret.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded knowingly, “He lied to you? Many men do that.”</p> <p>“I let him go this time to pay him back for saving my life. I have nothing to do with him from now on,” said Liu Jun.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave her a glance and said, “You offered him yourself. You didn’t owe him anything. You even bore him a son. He just didn’t treasure all that.”</p> <p>…</p> <p>Next day, Yuan Tianxing’s people guided the second batch of workers to the construction site. With more people, the work was getting done more efficiently.</p> <p>Lin Qiao led Qiu Lili, Xie Dong, and Shen Yujen out again. This time, they weren’t looking for supplies, but for land.</p> <p>They went out to look for land suitable for farming.</p> <p>The Upper City District was mostly occupied by buildings. However, there was a scenic spot named Mount Wu. Some lands around the mountain should be good enough for growing crops.</p> <p>Lin Qiao planned to go there and take a look.</p> <p>She picked that area also because Mount Wu wasn’t far away, and was right inside the Upper City District. Moreover, she hadn’t been eating any meat for a very long time!</p> <p>Thinking of meat, she couldn’t help but lick her lips.</p> <p>“What are you thinking about?” Qiu Lili looked at her and asked while thinking.</p> <p>Lin Qiao laughed, “I’m thinking that I haven’t had any meat for a long time. Today, we’ll get into the mountain and see what food we might find.”</p> <p>“You only eat animals. I don’t think they taste good,” said Qiu Lili. What Lin Qiao said didn’t interest her at all. After saying that, she filled her face with dislike.</p> <p>Xie Dong and Shen Yujen who were sitting in the backseat got confused by their conversation.</p> <p>“Aren’t you here to look for farming land?” Qiu Lili continued.</p> <p>Lin Qiao nodded and said, “Yeah. I can hunt while observing the land. Isn’t that perfect?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili gave her a weird glance and said, “Why do I feel that you look a little like a child who lives in the countryside? Did you always do such things when you were little?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao smilingly glanced at her and replied, “Can you tell?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao parked the car by the entrance of the Liangshan Road in Mount Wu area and then got off.</p> <p>A refreshing scent of the forest immediately embraced her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao leaned her head forward and sniffed around, then put the vehicle back into her space. After that, she pointed at the mountain forest and said, “I sense the smell of a mutant beast over there. Let’s go.”</p> <p>Then, she led the other three and began the adventure.</p> <p>Qiu Lili gently leaped up and directly hopped on top of a tree, bringing up a soft breeze. Meanwhile, Xie Dong and Shen Yujen quietly followed behind Lin Qiao, heading into the forest.</p> <p>Lin Qiao restrained her vibe entirely while following that smell further into the forest. The stones, grasses, and thorns under her feet could not affect her at all.</p> <p>She recognized that smell. If she were right, somewhere in front of her should be lots of… snakes.</p> <p>Yeah, the giant snake that she hunted the last time tasted nice.</p> <p>Except for the scents of snakes, she had also smelled mice. As some old people said, snakes and mice were family.</p> <p>Those mice smelled weird, but, Lin Qiao still had an appetite for them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao excitedly followed the smell of the snakes. The two zombies behind her had no idea why her eyes were glowing more and more brightly.</p> <p>Qiu Lili flew about seven-hundred meters forward, then silently flew back.</p> <p>When she saw those countless snakes coiling on the branches in that area, her scalp was even numbed. Without saying a word, she turned and headed back.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked about seven-hundred meters further into the forest, then saw a finger-thick, green-colored snake slide across. As she made two more steps, two small snakes with stripes swiftly wriggled across the backs of her feet.</p> <p>She raised her head to find all sorts of snakes in different colors coiling on the branches and the ground, squirming. Some of those snakes were as thick as her wrist, and some were as thin as her finger.</p> <p>She abruptly reached out a hand and caught an arm-thick black snake.</p> <p>It was about a meter long. As its neck was gripped in Lin Qiao’s hand, it coiled its body around her arm.</p> <p>Lin Qiao popped her claws and dragged the snake off her arm, then straightened it and poked one claw into its belly. With that, she began cutting it from the neck to the tail.</p> <p>Her claw cut open the snake’s belly and generated a noise. The snake was cut open alive, yet its tail was still twitching intensely.</p> <p>After opening the snake up, Lin Qiao put two fingers into its belly and stirred for a few times. Then, she took out the snake’s gall.</p> <p>Next, she opened her mouth and threw the snake gall in, swallowing it.</p> <p>She didn’t chew it this time, so she didn’t taste any bitterness. Last time, her brain had even stopped working because of the bitterness of the snake gall.</p>",
  "Chapter 415: Crazy Snake Eater</h1><p>": "<p>Lin Qiao swallowed the snake gall, then turned back and accidentally noticed the look of the two zombies which were behind her. She paused briefly, then asked, “Eh? What’s with that look on your face? Didn’t you ever eat snakes? Why are you standing so far away? Get over here. They can’t hurt zombies. You won’t get poisoned even if they bite you.”</p> <p>Xie Dong and Shen Yujen both shook their heads.</p> <p>Xie Dong might not react like this if there were only one snake, but this area was actually covered by snakes… He somehow felt that he had trypophobia.</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t react strongly to those snakes. He was a man after all; he wasn’t frightened. At least, his fine hair didn’t stand up. Unlike him, Shen Yujen took a serious fright. She quickly hid herself behind Xie Dong and refused to come out.</p> <p>Neither of them expected that Lin Qiao would bring them to a forest which was filled with snakes! There were snakes everywhere!</p> <p>Also, Lin Qiao caught a snake and ate it alive right in front of them…</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at them and said, “You won’t feel this way if you see these snakes as food.” While speaking, she suddenly threw two woven bags at Xie Dong and Shen Yujen.</p> <p>“Being afraid won’t help you. Get over here and catch some snakes. We’ll bring them back for those humans to make soup.”</p> <p>Xie Don took over the bags and looked at Lin Qiao, then at Shen Yujen who was behind him. The look on his face was weird.</p> <p>After throwing out the two bags, Lin Qiao began peeling the dead snake in her hand. Then, she tore off a piece of snake meat, put it in her mouth, and started chewing.</p> <p>The raw meat tasted tender. After turning into a zombie, Lin Qiao found that cooked meat tasted less fresh and tender than raw meat.</p> <p>Because Lin Qiao caught a large snake and ate it, the other snakes were all startled. They darted about to run away, in case they ended up like the snake in Lin Qiao’s hands. Meanwhile, the stunned Xie Dong and Shen Yujen watched Lin Qiao quickly eat up the arm-thick snake and turn it into bones.</p> <p>Lin Qiao threw away the bones, then sucked her fingers, turning to look for the next snake.</p> <p>As a result, she found that no snake existed in meters round anymore.</p> <p>With no other choice, she continued following the strong snake scent.</p> <p>Xie Dong sighed, then handed one of the bags to Shen Yujen, who took over the bag without knowing what to do.</p> <p>Did she really need to catch snakes? <em>‘God! Let me die! I don’t want to catch snakes!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao sensed her emotions. Abruptly, she turned back to look at her and said, “Go and find a forked stick, make two parts of the fork as long as each other, and then you’ll be able to catch snakes with that. When you want to put a snake into the bag, you should grip its neck to pick it up.”</p> <p>Xie Dong glanced at Shen Yujen, then at Lin Qiao. Shen Yujen closed her eyes and took a deep breath.</p> <p>“See this as a test for you. You need to get through it no matter how.” After saying that, she turned around and kept looking for snakes.</p> <p>Xie Dong glanced at Shen Yujen with pity. Clearly, Lin Qiao didn’t want him to help her. He was planning to let Shen Yujen hold the bag while he caught the snakes and put them into it.</p> <p>But now, she was on her own.</p> <p>Lin Qiao followed the scent and moved forward by leaping and hopping. Suddenly, she grasped the tail of an arm-thick python and violently swung it off a tree.</p> <p>Clap!</p> <p>The meter-long large python which weighed over ten kilograms was thrown to the ground. The python was knocked out as a result, softly falling off her hands.</p> <p>Lin Qiao drank its blood, then cut it open and ate its internal organs. After that, she began eating its meat.</p> <p>Maybe because she hadn’t had any meat for quite a long time, she just couldn’t stop eating once she started. Watching her eat, the other two zombies felt creepy.</p> <p>While moving deeper into the forest, Lin Qiao had been catching and eating snakes the whole time. Xie Dong and Shen Yujen followed behind her and caught some snakes from time to time.</p> <p>At first, only Xie Dong was catching snakes while Shen Yujen didn’t dare to touch them.</p> <p>However, it was already an improvement, as she actually had the courage to walk among snakes. Lin Qiao didn’t rush her, but was secretly paying attention to her.</p> <p>Xie Dong picked the large snakes without being reminded by Lin Qiao. He didn’t use a forked stick, but his own hands. Also, his movements were quick and neat. After all, he had done some field training when he was in the army. Back then, it was normal for him and his army brothers to eat snakes and rats and all sorts of animals.</p> <p>Earlier on, he reacted slowly because he was a little shocked upon seeing so many snakes.</p> <p>Shen Yujen spent quite a while following behind Xie Dong, then finally adjusted herself to all those snakes and forced herself to adapt.</p> <p>After all, Lin Qiao wanted her to work for her. If she couldn’t even catch a snake, what could she possibly do for Lin Qiao?</p> <p>And just now, Lin Qiao said that this was a test for her, and that she must complete it by herself.</p> <p>Lin Qiao caught seven to eight arm-thick snakes in a row and ate them all. After that, she turned back to find that Xie Dong had already filled a small half of his bag with snakes, while Shen Yujen only had two.</p> <p><em>‘Good, good, she’s making some progress. It’s already not bad for her to catch even one snake!’ </em>thought Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao ate so many snakes in a row before she finally stopped. Both Xie Dong and Shen Yujen eyed her with a strange look.</p> <p><em>‘You finally finished. You crazy snake eater! You’ve eaten all the large ones, and only left the small ones for us to catch. These aren’t enough for making soup.’</em></p> <p>An hour later, almost all the snakes in the forest were driven away by Lin Qiao.</p> <p>She sniffed around, then nimbly climbed onto a tree nearby to carefully sense the surrounding area while sniffing the air. After about seven seconds, she jumped off and said, “There’s a large one over there. You stay away from that area. I’ll deal with it myself.”</p> <p>Finishing talking, she flashed across the air and disappeared, leaving Xie Dong and Shen Yujen glancing at each other.</p> <p>The invisible Lin Qiao quickly moved toward a tree. She accurately stepped on stones or trees, leaping toward the mountaintop.</p> <p>The trees that she stepped on only swayed slightly or barely moved. Soon, she quickly arrived at the mountaintop and found a giant pit.</p> <p>Standing by the seven-meter deep pit which had the diameter of about twenty meters, Lin Qiao saw about ten small holes on its edge, each having the diameter of around a meter.</p> <p>A strong, bloody, and sweet scent was coming from those holes.</p> <p>In the pit were countless snakes, coiling on each other.</p> <p>That was a snake nest!</p> <p>Lin Qiao turned her head to look around, then walked to a large stone which weighed about thirty kilograms, then raised a foot and kicked it forward.</p> <p>The stone slowly rolled to the edge of the pit, then fell straight in.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>The stone fell to the bottom of the pit and killed countless snakes. The surviving snakes down there were stirred up, trying to wriggle out of the pit. However, Lin Qiao soon discovered that none of those snakes crawled into those holes. In fact, they all avoided those holes and tried to crawl out.</p>",
  "Chapter 416: Another Giant Snake": "<p>Lin Qiao squatted by the pit and watched all those snakes darting about. There might not be other animals in this mountain area, but the population of snakes was enormous!</p> <p>Most of those snakes were poisonous.</p> <p>A great number of snakes were wriggling out of the pit, but many stayed at the bottom.</p> <p>Lin Qiao raised a hand and released a stream of black mist from her palm. The black mist grew thicker and larger from her palm, drifting down to the bottom of the pit.</p> <p>Soon, the mist touched some snakes which all melted or vanished directly. Some snakes only had small parts of their bodies touched by the black mist, and the effect of the mist spread from those parts.</p> <p>Some snakes had their tails swallowed by the mist. After that, the rest of their bodies disappeared as well, bit by bit. Some snakes had the mist touch the middle of their bodies. As a result, their bodies vanished slowly toward both ends.</p> <p>Not a single snake survived the black mist.</p> <p>The snakes in the pit had just quieted down a little from the chaos brought by the stone, but under the effect of the black mist, they were agitated again. Lin Qiao’s black mist slowly covered all the snakes which didn’t manage to get out of the pit, then split up and drilled into those holes.</p> <p>She sent endless black mist into those holes. As the large ones refused to come out, she wouldn’t stop sending black mist into those holes.</p> <p>At that moment, a voice was suddenly heard from her head, <em>‘Mama, Mama… I smelled a delicious energy source… Mama, are you hunting some kind of mutant animal?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao paused in shock. Viney had become an oosperm, yet she just couldn’t stay quiet and always talked!</p> <p>Lin Qiao made herself visible, then stood up and said, “You’re in my belly. How can you smell the energy source?”</p> <p>Viney responded well, <em>‘Well… I sensed it then… I can feel it anyway…’</em></p> <p>“Alright. I’m trying to catch a snake,” said Lin Qiao, “Why didn’t I sense an energy source? I only sensed a nice smell of meat.”</p> <p><em>‘Mama, get the snake, get the snake!’ </em>said Viney happily <em>, ‘When you get it, can you put the energy nucleus on your belly?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was surprised. Put it on her belly? Shouldn’t she just eat it?</p> <p>She glanced down at her own belly with a strange look, then asked, “Put on my belly? Can’t I just eat it?”</p> <p>In fact, she always knew that she was able to absorb energy nuclei by eating them. Earlier, she absorbed some zombie nuclei with her hand because those used to be in zombie brains, and she didn’t want to eat them.</p> <p>As for the energy nuclei of mutant animals and plants, she had no problem eating them.</p> <p><em>‘Mama, you’ll get choked up if you eat it! You’re a zombie… Isn’t it weird for a zombie to get choked up? Haha…’ </em>said Viney.</p> <p>Lin Qiao didn’t respond.</p> <p><em>‘She actually laughed at me. Why is she getting bolder and bolder? Earlier on, she entrapped Wu Chengyue and me, and just now, she teased me!’</em></p> <p>Before Lin Qiao replied, Viney stopped laughing and continued, <em>‘Mama, I’ll be able to absorb more of the energy if you put the nucleus on your belly. If you ate it or absorb the energy first, I’ll only get a small amount of energy. I can’t grow without energy sources… Mama, do you want me to stay in your belly for years?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was a little speechless.</p> <p><em>‘You are not Nezha <sup>1</sup> </em>!’</p> <p>“Alright, alright, I get it! You have already become an embryo, so how can you still talk?”</p> <p>Viney responded, <em>‘Yeah, I can only talk to Mama, but not for a long time. Alright, I’m tired. Mama, don’t forget to put the nucleus on your belly…’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao suddenly realized that based on what Viney had just said, she needed a certain amount of energy to develop. So, how much energy did she need?</p> <p>“Wait a minute! How much energy do you need to absorb before you can come out of my body?” she asked hurriedly.</p> <p>Viney’s voice was heard after quite a while, <em>‘Em… I’m not sure either. It depends…’</em></p> <p>Depends? Lin Qiao was stunned a little. If she didn’t know about this, she might not give Viney any energy. If that were the case, would Viney stay in her belly for three or even five years?</p> <p><em>‘Oh my! What the hell? I don’t want to bear a child who’s like Nezha!’</em></p> <p>Thinking about that, Lin Qiao was not comfortable. Thankfully, Viney had told her about that. If she didn’t, when would Lin Qiao actually give birth to her? Lin Qiao thought that Viney had become like a normal human fetus that would come out in just nine months.</p> <p>However, she thought for a moment and then understood why. She was a zombie. Even though she now looked almost the same as human beings, she was still a zombie. Her blood had started flowing very slowly in her body, but it was flowing in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Her blood had been flowing into her heart from her left atrium, then coming out of the right atrium.</p> <p>She didn’t know how her heart worked. The only thing sure was that she was not the same as the other zombies, because the blood of normal zombies would not flow.</p> <p>Although her blood had started to flow through her heart, her heart was still not beating.</p> <p>Her body was in a weird state.</p> <p>She didn’t even know what she was now. Half-human and half-zombie?</p> <p>As Lin Qiao was feeling a little confused, a slight buzzing noise was suddenly heard from the pit.</p> <p>She immediately diverted her attention from Viney and focused on the holes down there.</p> <p>Before long, her black mist was stirred, and a giant snake swished out.</p> <p>It was an enormous snake. It wriggled swiftly under the black mist, its dark and shiny scales partially visible.</p> <p>Hiss… Hiss…</p> <p>Lin Qiao heard the sound it made, like heavy breathing.</p> <p>She raised her hand to called back the black mist, then fixed her eyes on the snake. It was a huge king cobra!</p> <p>Hiss… Hiss… The king cobra was even thicker than Lin Qiao’s waist. It coiled on the bottom of the pit and looked like a tiny pyramid while its banana-leaf-shaped head was raised high.</p> <p>It glared at Lin Qiao with a pair of beady and fierce eyes. On its coiled body, many of its strong scales had been burnt.</p> <p>Those scales were corroded by Lin Qiao’s black mist.</p> <p>The snake had a very strong vibe. It stared at Lin Qiao coldly without showing any sign of escaping or attacking.</p> <p>Lin Qiao observed the snake. It was much larger than the snake that she had caught the last time.</p> <p>Lin Qiao’s mist was actually not very harmful to this king cobra. Earlier on, the mist which flowed into those holes touched its scales, but had only been melting them very slowly.</p> <p>The scales which had been touched by the mist had become like coke, but not broken or fallen off.</p>",
  "Chapter 417: The Intense Fight of a Zombie, Dog, and Snake": "<p>By the look of this king cobra, it was at least twenty meters long. It looked like a small hill, almost filling the pit up by coiling in it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was curious about what the king cobra fed on that allowed it to grow so large. Also, she felt that mutant snakes were quite often seen after the apocalypse.</p> <p>Seeing all those smaller snakes around this place, Lin Qiao figured that it might be living on other snakes. She knew that large snakes would eat small snakes sometimes, as long as those small snakes were from different families.</p> <p>She stared at that huge snake, wondering how many snakes it had to eat for one meal to fulfill its stomach.</p> <p>Hiss! The king cobra reared up its head to gaze at Lin Qiao aggressively, with its half-meter-long forked tongue darting out from time to time.</p> <p>Lin Qiao flicked her claws. It seemed that only powerful physical attacks could hurt this snake. The black mist had failed to destroy its skin and scales, so she had to use her claws to break its scales.</p> <p>As she prepared to jump into the pit to fight the black king cobra, she suddenly recalled that Viney had warned her about not fighting too intensely.</p> <p>Thinking about that, she paused all of a sudden.</p> <p>No intense close combat? How was she supposed to fight this battle then?</p> <p>Sneak attack seemed to be the only option left.</p> <p>Thinking of sneak attack, Lin Qiao suddenly had an idea. She had a dog in her space! She decided to bring out the dog and let it fight the snake, then find an opportunity to launch a sneak attack!</p> <p>So, she immediately flashed into her space.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao suddenly disappeared and her vibe was gone, the king cobra was puzzled for a second, and then began looking all around watchfully.</p> <p>It carefully scanned the surrounding area for a couple of times, but still didn’t see a trace of Lin Qiao. By that time, the king cobra had lowered its raised head and buried it in its coiled body, only exposing its eyes and jaws.</p> <p>Lin Qiao entered her space and directly showed up next to the zombie dog.</p> <p>“Awooo…” The zombie dog sprung up from the ground as it was startled by the suddenly appearing Lin Qiao. It hopped to the other side and bared its teeth to Lin Qiao while uttering unhappy roars.</p> <p>“Er… er…”</p> <p>Lin Qiao rested her hands on her waist and said, “Oi, oi, are you mad at me now? Do you want to be beaten up? I was going to let you out and have some fun, yet how dare you roar at me like that! Don’t you want to go out?”</p> <p>She glanced at that water bowl and found that it was already emptied. The water in it had been drunk up, and not even a drop splashed out.</p> <p>Hearing her words, the zombie dog paused for a second, then stared at her with glowing eyes. Next, it lowered its head and wagged its tail while approaching her.</p> <p>“Awooo… Awo…” <em>‘I’ve been chained in this place for a very long time. You didn’t let me go, didn’t give me any food either. You only gave me a bowl of water… That is very inhuman… You’re abusing a dog!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the dog and laughed, “Do you still remember that you’re a dog? Do you remember that you’ve already died, and that you’re a dead dog now?”</p> <p>“Roar… bow-wow…” The zombie dog hopped toward her and let out strange barks.</p> <p>Being chained up was so horrible. It wasn’t able to go anywhere. All it could do was to circle around this tree. By doing that, it wrapped the vine all on the tree, and as a result, it couldn’t even move for a while. After that, it circled in the opposite direction to free itself.</p> <p>Many bite marks were left on the tree, but the tree was barely harmed. That meant that the dog couldn’t even bite into the tree!</p> <p>Just now, hearing Lin Qiao talk about letting it out, the dog was surely excited. So now, as Lin Qiao seemed to go back on her word, the zombie dog hurriedly tried to show a good attitude to her.</p> <p>“I’ll let you out and play,” said Lin Qiao, “But, if you run away, I’ll catch you and beat you to death. Do you understand that? I won’t even give you the water! Do you get it?”</p> <p>“Roar…” Hearing about no water, the zombie dog began complaining. That water was great, and provided it energy! The water was able to boost the dog’s energy, and it also made it feel comfortable. After drinking that water, the dog felt as if its entire body was comforted. It couldn’t forget that feeling.</p> <p>“Follow me if you want more of that water,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie dog nodded quickly. In fact, it was willing to follow Lin Qiao now for a few reasons.</p> <p>First, Lin Qiao had that magical water; second, she was able to communicate with it. It hadn’t really communicated with other animals or zombies before, so it was quite lonely. It was pretty miraculous that Lin Qiao and the dog were able to understand each other. And third, Lin Qiao was powerful; so the dog figured that staying with her would lead to a good life!</p> <p>As the dog agreed without hesitation, Lin Qiao walked to the tree and untied it. After that, she held the vine and brought the dog out of the space.</p> <p>Once Lin Qiao and the dog showed up, the king cobra which had been staying on alert immediately fixed its eyes on her. To the snake’s surprise, a dog was standing beside her.</p> <p>In fact, the scent of zombies was not attractive to the king cobra at all. However, the strong pressure from Lin Qiao’s powerful vibe gave it no other choice but to stay vigilant.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had no idea which level that king cobra was at. Judging by the fact that even her black mist could barely hurt it, she guessed that the snake was at level-five at least.</p> <p>“Roar!” The zombie dog raised its head and gave a howl of excitement once it came out. And then, it was immediately attracted by the scent of the king cobra.</p> <p>Normal zombies wouldn’t eat animals, but zombie beasts would. Most of them lived on raw meat before death, so after turning into zombies, they still fed on animals. They ate mutated animals as well, even though those tasted not as good as unmutated animals.</p> <p>Therefore, the zombie dog was interested in the mutated king cobra once it spotted it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched it slightly bend its forelimbs and gaze at the mutated snake in the pit.</p> <p>“Go, bite it!” While speaking, Lin Qiao let go of the vine in her hand, and then the zombie dog darted down into the pit.</p> <p>After that, Lin Qiao disappeared again.</p> <p>“Hiss!” The king cobra widely opened its jaws toward the zombie dog and popped its fangs as the latter rushed down. But, the zombie dog wasn’t afraid of its fangs. It pounced on the snake’s coiled body which looked like a small hill, then bared its sharp teeth and bit.</p> <p>When it bit the snake, the snake’s fangs sank into its body as well. A large amount of venom was injected into the dog’s body, yet did not manage to hurt it.</p> <p>“Errr…” The zombie dog growled with a deep voice while violently pulling the snake outward. The snake’s body was soon uncoiled.</p> <p>Hiss!</p> <p>The zombie dog couldn’t feel pain, yet the snake could. It didn’t expect its strong scales to break under the dog’s teeth. The sharp dog teeth pierced into the snake’s body and tore it, making the giant snake struggle in pain.</p> <p>The zombie dog tried to drag the snake out of the pit.</p> <p>Right at that moment, Lin Qiao, who had been waiting for an opportunity, swung her sharp claws at the king cobra’s stomach, which was accidentally exposed because of the pain.</p> <p>Puff!</p> <p>As she expected, the scales on the king cobra’s stomach were relatively soft. Her claws broke the skin on the snake’s stomach and left a few long wounds.</p>",
  "Chapter 418: The Poor Giant Snake": "<p>“Geeee…” The mutated snaked suddenly gave a weird scream. Its scream wasn’t loud, but was very shrill. In the meantime, its body twisted because of the pain.</p> <p>Lin Qiao moved away from it once her attack worked.</p> <p>“Roarrrr…” The zombie dog didn’t let go of the king cobra. It had bitten into the snake’s body, but failed to tear off a piece. On the contrary, it got coiled by the snake pretty tightly when the latter struggled in pain.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at the zombie dog which was disabled from moving in just the first round.</p> <p><em>‘You’re a level-five zombie dog. How can you lose the fight so quickly? Don’t you know how to hide? Was your brain damaged when you turned into a zombie dog from a dead dog? </em>‘ she thought.</p> <p>Just when she thought that the zombie dog would be distorted by the king cobra, she suddenly saw a red light sparkle in the dog’s mouth. As the red light grew brighter and brighter, the king cobra quickly relaxed its grip on the dog and moved away, as if it got burned.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked closely, then figured out what happened. Just now, the king cobra exposed its wounds to the zombie dog when it tried to coil the latter tightly. As a result, the zombie dog opened its mouth to release a fire, and gave it a greater pain that made it quickly uncoil itself from the dog.</p> <p><em>‘The dog is a strong fighter </em>,’ Lin Qiao thought.</p> <p>Realizing that the dog was able to fight the snake for a while, Lin Qiao stood aside and watched without doing anything else.</p> <p>The dog had a couple of rib bones squeezed broken by the king cobra, but it didn’t really mind, as those broken ribs could hardly affect it.</p> <p>It immediately followed the king cobra and pounced on it.</p> <p>The zombie dog was aware that the king cobra could barely hurt it, so it began attacking it crazily without putting up any defense.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood beside the pit, watching the dog chase and bite the snake. The dog was occasionally sent flying away by the snake’s tail, but it soon sprung up and charged again.</p> <p>After being bitten by a few times, the snake was frightened of the dog.</p> <p>Those bite wounds weren’t lethal to the snake, but they hurt like hell. The snake started trying to get out of the pit. It didn’t dare to go back into those holes, as Lin Qiao’s black mist still lingered in there.</p> <p>Earlier on when it wasn’t wounded, its scales were corroded by the dark mist. But now, as it was covered in wounds, the black mist would directly drill its wounds and burn its blood and flesh.</p> <p>The snake didn’t know about all that clearly, but it was subconsciously aware that going in those holes would be even more dangerous.</p> <p>Therefore, it chose to run toward the outside.</p> <p>However, the zombie dog followed closely behind. The dog bit on its tail and back to drag it down, and never gave it one chance to run. The zombie dog was swift and nimble. It hopped around to chase the king cobra without missing any chance to give it a bite.</p> <p>So, the king cobra was suffering pain, itch, panic, and helplessness. It darted all over the pit; it tried to get out, but ended up being dragged back down; it turned back to bite the zombie dog, yet the latter dodged. Its attack failed to even land on the dog’s body.</p> <p>Soon, the king cobra was exhausted. It couldn’t even crawl as quickly as it used to, and it was no longer able to dodge nimbly. However, the zombie dog was still attacking it energetically.</p> <p>After standing by the pit and watching for half an hour, Lin Qiao finally witnessed the end of this fight.</p> <p>The giant snake lay weakly in the pit, curled up. It exposed its back which was the strongest part of its body in the air, with its head and stomach buried inside. No matter how violently the zombie dog attacked, it wouldn’t fight back. It had given up on resisting.</p> <p>Lin Qiao jumped into the pit and gave the zombie dog which wouldn’t relax its bite on the snake a gentle kick.</p> <p>“Alright, get up. Don’t you see that it’s already too weak to fight back?”</p> <p>“Roar…” The zombie dog released the snake reluctantly, then sat down and raised its head to look at Lin Qiao.</p> <p><em>‘I didn’t get to eat any meat yet!’</em></p> <p>Its teeth were sharp enough to pierce through the snake’s scales, but it didn’t manage to tear off a single piece of snake meat. That made it a little upset.</p> <p>Lin Qiao popped her claws and said, “Do you want some?”</p> <p>The zombie dog’s claws and teeth couldn’t cut the snake open, but Lin Qiao’s claws could.</p> <p>Seeing her claws, the zombie dog’s ink-dark eyes glowed, fixed on her with anticipation.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took two small steps backward, then raised her claws and prepared to swing her arm at the giant snake. But suddenly, she saw the snake’s eyes through a small slit between its coiled body.</p> <p>Despair, sadness, fear, anger… A mixed emotion was expressed from those eyes.</p> <p>Lin Qiao was stunned slightly, and her arm froze in the air.</p> <p>Those eyes told her that the snake did nothing wrong. Why would she kill it? It was staying in its underground nest without offending anyone. Why would it be killed.</p> <p><em>‘Eh?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao was surprised. Earlier, the snake confronted her calmly without showing any emotion; but now, she suddenly found out that it actually had feelings.</p> <p>It understood that it was going to die. It wasn’t frenzied by despair, but curled up to try and protect itself with its last strength.</p> <p>The snake that Lin Qiao caught the last time was frenzied in the beginning.</p> <p>Seeing the snake’s sad and despairing eyes, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but get soft-hearted.</p> <p>She dropped her arm and walked to the snake, then reached out a hand and pressed her palm on the giant snake’s broken skin.</p> <p>The snake flinched, but didn’t try to dodge.</p> <p>Once Lin Qiao touched its body, she was overwhelmed by sadness. She stayed silent for five or six seconds, then took her hand back.</p> <p>Why did she fell that she was bullying a weak being? Why was she suffering that guilt now? Was it because this snake knew how to act pitifully?</p> <p>She took two steps backward. The zombie dog looked at her confusedly.</p> <p><em>‘Aren’t you going to cut the meat? </em>‘ it wondered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao lowered her head and said to the zombie dog, “We’re not going to eat it. It’s already a poor thing, as we suddenly injured it so badly. If we ate it, it’d be even more pitiful.”</p> <p><em>‘What does pitiful mean </em>?’ The zombie dog looked at her with confusion.</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt quite speechless about the fact that she was talking to a dead dog about that. She thought for a second, then picked up the vine to drag the dog out of the pit. Meanwhile, she reached an arm backward.</p> <p>The black mist which had been lingering in those small holes was taken back by her. Streams of mist flowed out of those small holes and into Lin Qiao’s palm.</p> <p>Seeing Lin Qiao step back, the snake’s rhombic eyes showed confusion as well.</p> <p>Lin Qiao gave up on killing the snake, but the zombie dog refused to accept it as a result.</p> <p>“Awooo…” It quickly stood up and lowered its head while uttering deep growls toward the snake. Meanwhile, it kicked its limbs backward, sending the sand and earth behind.</p>",
  "Chapter 419: Why Can’t You Keep Other Animals?": "<p>The zombie dog was unhappy. It fought that snake so hard, having defeated it and getting prepared to eat it. But, why on earth was Lin Qiao letting the snake go? The dog didn’t understand!</p> <p>“Clearly, I brought you out only to let you have some fun,” said Lin Qiao, “I make the decision about whether we’re going to eat it or not. If you want meat, we’ll catch some other snakes.”</p> <p>“Awoo… Awo…” The zombie dog was still pawing at the ground and letting out unhappy grows.</p> <p>Lin Qiao kicked on it’s a*s and said impatiently, “Why’re you howling? You can’t eat it, because I say so. Let’s go!”</p> <p>While speaking, she violently dragged the dog up.</p> <p>The zombie dog followed her out of the pit very reluctantly while turning back again and again to look at the snake which was still at the bottom of the pit. As Lin Qiao and the dog left, the snake slightly relaxed its tightly coiled body and raised its head to watch Lin Qiao drag the zombie dog away. It was greatly confused.</p> <p>Quite a while later, the king coil uncoiled itself and quietly crawled to the edge of the pit, sneakily sticking its head out of the pit to observe the surrounding area. After making sure that Lin Qiao was really gone, it suddenly rolled back down and darted into the nearest small hole.</p> <p>Lin Qiao came downhill and saw Xie Dong and Shen Yujen staying where they were. The bags in their hands had been squirming. Clearly, they had each caught quite some snakes.</p> <p>Xie Dong and Shen Yujen both fixed their eyes on the huge zombie dog which was leashed by Lin Qiao. The dog looked entirely rotten, covered in dirty blood; and its body was weirdly distorted.</p> <p>They had both seen zombie beasts, which were like zombies. No matter how horribly their bodies were damaged, they were able to move flexibly and bite people like zombies as long as their brains were good.</p> <p>Unlike normal zombies, zombie beasts were fast and nimble. They were agile, traceless, and hard to put up a defense against. They were also strong, and their attacks were highly lethal.</p> <p>Therefore, Xie Dong and his old teammates would rather encounter zombies than zombie beasts when they left the base for missions. Even mutated animals were better than zombie beasts, as the former wouldn’t attack people actively.</p> <p>Zombie beasts would excitedly charge at all human beings they saw like dung beetles that had smelled dung.</p> <p>Looking at the awfully distorted, extremely ugly zombie dog, Xie Dong felt that Lin Qiao had such a weird hobby.</p> <p><em>‘I understand that you want to have a pet, but can’t you have a pretty and adorable one? Well, it’d be okay if you don’t like pretty and adorable animals, but please, at least find a normal creature, alright? Why do you have this zombie dog? Its skin is wrinkled, its chest is hollowed, it’s covered in rotten wounds, and its mouth is cracked!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao conveniently dragged a thumb-thick snake off a branch nearby and threw it at the zombie dog’s mouth.</p> <p>“Here, don’t you want a snake? Eat it.”</p> <p>“Pah!” The zombie dog automatically spat the small snake out with a strong dislike. How could such an energy-less snake be compared with that giant, high-leveled one? That one smelled way better.</p> <p>Seeing the surprised look on the faces of Xie Dong and Shen Yujen, Lin Qiao said to them, “Look, isn’t it cool?”</p> <p>Shen Yujen and Xie Dong both shook their heads. They just could not understand how this terribly ugly zombie dog was cool.</p> <p>Lin Qiao laughed and continued, “You don’t understand. It’ll become gorgeous when I slowly fix its body.”</p> <p>Xie Dong paused briefly, while Shen Yujen looked at him confusedly with puzzles in her eyes. Xie Dong knew about the miraculous healing power of Lin Qiao’s magical lake water. Thus, he observed the zombie dog once again. Judging by the shape of its head, it used to be a wolf dog before it turned into a zombie dog.</p> <p>He pictured how the zombie dog would look like after its skin and fur were fixed. Its sticky fur would become smooth and shiny; when the wounds on its head were healed, it would have a pair of standing ears and sharp eyes. It would be huge and healthy, with strong limbs and sharp teeth.</p> <p>Its large and fluffy tail would be wagging. Indeed, it would look much more gorgeous than now.</p> <p>However, what Lin Qiao said next broke his imagination.</p> <p>“But, don’t you think that it looks like Cerberus <sup>1</sup> from the legend?If only it had three heads…”</p> <p>Xie Dong didn’t know how to respond.</p> <p><em>‘That would be a monster!’</em></p> <p>When Lin Qiao approached with the zombie dog, Shen Yujen had already drawn back to the side. The zombie dog was so hideous and scary.</p> <p>Watching the two’s reactions, Lin Qiao said, “What are you afraid of? You’re zombies, so it won’t attack you.”</p> <p>She glanced at their bags, then continued, “Alright, we’ve gotten enough snakes. Now, let’s go and try to find some farmlands.”</p> <p>After saying that, she dragged the zombie dog out of the woods.</p> <p>On the highway, she let out a vehicle.</p> <p>“Hop on,” she patted the car roof and said to the zombie dog, which dog looked at her with confusion.</p> <p>“Get up, or I’ll send you back to the woods. Do you like that?” Lin Qiao continued.</p> <p>“Awooo…” the zombie dog didn’t want that, so it hurriedly leaped onto the car roof.</p> <p>Lin Qiao dropped the vine, then abruptly released a stream of black mist from her other palm. Next, she raised her head and said to the dog, “You stay up here by yourself. If you run, I won’t stop you, but devour you. You know what to do.”</p> <p>The black mist drifted up to the car roof and surrounded the zombie dog.</p> <p>“Awooo…” As the dark mist was so close to it, the zombie dog immediately dropped its ears and lied on the car roof. That mist made it feel very, very afraid, and Lin Qiao had threatened it. The zombie dog knew how powerful she was, and was aware that it would never be able to run away from her.</p> <p>Also, it had sensed an even stronger vibe than Lin Qiao. It didn’t know who owned that vibe. If it took off, it might encounter the owner of that powerful vibe. Would it be killed by that mysterious being?</p> <p>The smart zombie dog was actually afraid of death like many other creatures. It would have a sense of crisis under absolute suppression. So, it now suddenly felt that staying around Lin Qiao was actually safe.</p> <p>As the dog became quiet and motionless, Lin Qiao opened the car door and sat into the driver’s seat. Meanwhile, Xie Dong and Shen Yujen tied up their bags tightly and threw them into the trunk, then got into the backseat.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a short while waiting for Qiu Lili, but the latter didn’t show up. She figured that Qiu Lili didn’t want to take a ride, so she started the car and drove toward Mount Wu.</p> <p>After a few turns, she saw a plain area covered in grasses. From those grasses, she surprisingly sensed a sweet smell which belonged to sweetcorn and sweet potatoes.</p> <p>She parked the car by the plain, then came out to carefully observe this piece of land. As she expected, she found some sweet potato leaves from the grasses, and some other plants, such as sweetcorn.</p> <p>That was the source of the sweet scent which she had sensed. However, the sweetcorn plants were rarely found, while lots of sweet potato plants were seen.</p>",
  "Chapter 420: The Sweet Potato And Sweetcorn Field": "<p>Lin Qiao walked into the field and was surprised to find that except for all sorts of unknown grasses, only sweet potato and sweetcorn were growing in this land. The sweet potato plants had occupied about three acres, and were incredibly thriving.</p> <p>The grasses and sweet potato plants were overgrowing while the sweetcorn plants were scattered sparsely among them.</p> <p>What surprised Lin Qiao was that the sweet potato plants were deeply infected by the zombie virus, while the sweetcorn plants were not. That was the reason why she sensed the sweet scent of the corn. However, that scent was only attractive for human beings, not for her as a zombie.</p> <p>But still, she was able to recognize that sweet scent.</p> <p>She stepped on sweet potato leaves and walked toward a sweetcorn plant. She broke off a corn cob, then peeled it and exposed the yellow corns.</p> <p>Once she did that, the sweet scent grew even stronger. She looked at it, then put it into her mouth and took a bite.</p> <p>She chewed and swallowed it, feeling like eating plastic. It was tasteless.</p> <p>She gave a glance to the corn cob which was bitten by her, then threw it away. She wouldn’t eat it if she knew that it tasted awful. And now that she had bitten it, she guessed that the corn cob was already covered in the virus.</p> <p><em>‘Eh?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao suddenly had a question.</p> <p>Last time, she and Wu Chengyue were entrapped by Viney and had sex. During that process, Wu Chengyue had kissed her for more than just one time, and even stirred in her mouth with his tongue. What a lecher!</p> <p>She wondered if Wu Chengyue was infected by the virus from her mouth. Or, was he immune to the virus because he was surrounded by Viney’s energy at that moment?</p> <p>Wu Chengyue made intimate contact with a zombie, but wasn’t harmed at all. On the contrary, the zombie was raped and got pregnant… Well, although it was planned by Viney, Lin Qiao was still unhappy about that. In fact, the more she thought about that, the more upset she felt.</p> <p><em>‘Viney was born to bring me troubles! </em>‘ she thought.</p> <p>She had a feeling that if she ever saw Wu Chengyue again, she would fall into a deeper trap. Viney seemed to like Wu Yueling very much. Even though she liked Wu Yueling herself as well, she wouldn’t want to be with Wu Chengyue because of the little girl. Unlike her, Viney had accepted Wu Chenyue because of Wu Yueling, so she sold her mother to the little one! Lin Qiao had this bad feeling, so she decided to stay away from Wu Chengyue, far away!</p> <p>Nevertheless, she had no idea that Wu Chengyue was coming at her.</p> <p>She got rid of all those thoughts, then began observing those sweet potato leaves. She felt that those leaves were protecting those sweetcorn plants. They absorbed all the virus, so the sweet corn plants could grow like before the apocalypse.</p> <p>A small part of those sweet potato leaves around the sweetcorn plants weren’t infected either, but those were rare and hard to discover.</p> <p>Normal people would try to keep away from such a large number of mutated sweet potato plants once they spotted them.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked closely at those dark-purple sweet potato leaves which were supposed to be green, thinking that it would cost a great effort to clean them off from this field.</p> <p>There were about three acres of them. Human beings couldn’t touch these mutated plants, so this field needed to be cleaned by zombies.</p> <p>Zombies… zombies…</p> <p>Lin Qiao suddenly felt that her zombie squad was short-handed again!</p> <p>But fortunately, she had her superpowers that allowed her to directly vanish all those mutated sweet potato leaves.</p> <p>The sweetcorn cob which was bitten by her and thrown to the ground had entirely turned black. She couldn’t tell if it was because of her bite or because it was thrown onto those mutated sweet potato leaves.</p> <p>She stood beside that sweetcorn plant and looked at the other sweetcorn plants. Some of them had one or two corncobs each, and some hadn’t had any yet.</p> <p>She counted all sweetcorn plants and got a number less than a hundred.</p> <p>However, every sweetcorn plant was surrounded by two or three uninfected sweet potato plants, meaning that about three-hundred virus-free sweet potato plants were growing in this field. Once the mutated sweet potato plants were cleaned out, more healthy sweet potato plants might grow out.</p> <p>Sweet potato had strong vitality, and was perfectly viable. So, as long as the soil was secured from the zombie virus, this place would become a thriving sweet potato field in just a couple of months.</p> <p>At that moment, the zombie dog suddenly jumped off the car roof and rushed at Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“Stop! Don’t step on these plants! If you ruin my sweetcorn and sweet potato, I’ll kick you’re a*s! I’m telling you!” Lin Qiao turned around and yelled at the zombie dog which was darting toward her.</p> <p>“Awoo…” The zombie dog hurriedly stopped running and paused in a bush of mutated sweet potato leaves.</p> <p>Those mutated sweet potato plants were tall and flourishing, reaching Lin Qiao’s knees in height. Once the zombie dog came down into the field, its limbs were buried in sweet potato leaves.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked over and stood by its side, then pointed at a sweetcorn plant and said, “Look, this tall kind of plant, don’t touch it, not even a little bit. Don’t even approach it… do you understand?”</p> <p>The zombie dog curiously reached its head forward to sniff at the plant, then made two steps toward it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao hurriedly shouted at it, “Don’t move! I just told you not to get close to it! Do you want some a*s-kicking? Huh?”</p> <p>The zombie dog stopped moving, then turned to look at her confusedly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to it and raised a hand to pat its head. However, she stopped upon seeing the awful wounds on its head. She sighed, then pointed at some mutated sweet potato plants and said, “Go this way, go!”</p> <p>While speaking, she gently kicked the zombie dog on an unwounded area of its body. This time, the zombie dog seemed to understand her meaning, as it quickly moved toward those mutated sweet potato plants.</p> <p>The zombie dog made a few steps, then turned back to glance at Lin Qiao. As Lin Qiao didn’t yell at it, it kept moving. Every time it got close to a sweetcorn plant, Lin Qiao would shout at it.</p> <p>So gradually, the zombie dog learned to avoid all sweetcorn plants.</p> <p>As Lin Qiao stopped paying attention to it, the zombie dog began running about wildly in the mutated sweet potato field. It leaped toward the small hill in front of the field like a giant rabbit. With one hop, it could cover two or three meters.</p> <p>Lin Qiao let the dog do whatever it wanted after it had learned to avoid the sweetcorn plants.</p> <p>She knew what it was looking for, because she had sensed the scent of large rats from that hill.</p> <p>She was surprised to find that some rats existed in this area.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, then followed behind the zombie dog.</p> <p>By the roadside, Xie Dong and Shen Yujen were both staring at the zombie dog which was happily running in the field. They wore a strange expression, as they still couldn’t accept the fact that Lin Qiao kept this dog as a pet. However, judging by the way Lin Qiao communicated with the dog, it was rather obedient.</p> <p>But of course, it would only follow Lin Qiao’s words. As for other people’s words…</p> <p>Well, that should be impossible. Who else could make a zombie dog obedient? Xie Dong guessed that no one but Lin Qiao had that ability.</p>",
  "Chapter 421: Clean The Sweet Potato Field": "<p>Lin Qiao followed the zombie dog through the sweet potato field. There was a small hill nearby, covered in vines and thorns, with no path to take. However, in the eyes of the zombie dog, that was not a problem. It easily got through by lowering its head and darting into the woods, or leaping high. Soon, it disappeared without a trace.</p> <p>Lin Qiao followed behind it, watching it excitedly lunge into the woods. She didn’t get in, but stayed around the sweet potato field and observed.</p> <p>After spending a while watching, she hopped onto a meter-tall stone nearby, then waved a hand to release a stream of dark mist. The mist divided into a few wisps and scattered before sinking into different parts of the sweet potato field.</p> <p>Each wisp of dark mist immediately created a hole in the sweet potato field, which slowly expanded. Maybe because Lin Qiao didn’t release enough dark mist, the sweet potato plants had been vanishing quite slowly. The further those holes expanded, the slower those sweet potato plants disappeared.</p> <p>Soon, a few two-meters-wide holes appeared in the mutated sweet potato filed. The sweet potato plants in the hole areas had been devoured, and the soil was exposed.</p> <p>All this while, Lin Qiao didn’t let the smoke touch any sweetcorn plant.</p> <p>As those devoured areas were about two-meters in diameter, she started making a more detailed plan.</p> <p>At first, she cleaned out all the sweet potato plants in other parts of the sweet potato field, then cleaned the ones near the stone that she was standing on bit by bit. She did it with extra care to avoid those sweetcorn plants and healthy sweet potato plants.</p> <p>Before long, all the thriving mutated sweet potato plants were swept out by Lin Qiao, including the vines; the large, clean earth was exposed.</p> <p>However, the soil wasn’t good enough, which was something Lin Qiao could tell by smelling it.</p> <p>A while later, some noises were heard from the woods in the behind. Following the noises, the zombie dog darted out.</p> <p>It was holding something in its mouth. Seeing the bared soil, it was puzzled for a moment, and its’ dog face was filled with confusion.</p> <p>It remembered that this place had lots of plants, and it had leaped through them. Why were those plants suddenly gone?</p> <p>The zombie dog confusedly stopped by the stone that Lin Qiao was standing on. Lin Qiao lowered her head to look at it, and found that the thing in its mouth was struggling.</p> <p>Squeak!</p> <p>Lin Qiao felt a little speechless upon seeing the rabbit-sized squirrel in the dog’s mouth.</p> <p>What happened to the animals after the apocalypse? Had they been taking growth hormones? Why were they all so large?</p> <p>The squirrel was large indeed, but not too large for the zombie dog’s mouth. The dog’s teeth sank deeply into its body and held it firmly.</p> <p>No matter how hard the large squirrel struggled and how quickly its fluffy big tail wagget, it wasn’t able to free itself from the dog’s mouth.</p> <p>“Whooo…” The zombie dog held the squirrel in its mouththen , reared up its head to look at Lin Qiao. However, it didn’t seem to offer the squirrel to Lin Qiao, but instead, it was asking for Lin Qiao’s permission.</p> <p>“Alright, that’s your prey, you eat it alone. I won’t fight you over it,” Lin Qiao glanced at it and said impatiently.</p> <p>After getting her permission, the zombie dog happily brought the squirrel to a clearing, then lied down and pressed the squirrel with its forepaws before relaxing its bite.</p> <p>After that, it gave a few glances at the squirrel which was struggling desperately under its claw, then suddenly opened its mouth and bite on its fist-sized head.</p> <p>Crack! The squirrel’s neck bone was bitten broken by the zombie dog. The dog held the squirrel’s head in its mouth and pressed the squirrel body with its paws, then pulled the head off.</p> <p>The dead squirrel’s skin and muscles were stretched long before breaking off, and then its blood gushed out.</p> <p>The zombie dog chewed up the squirrel’s head loudly.</p> <p>Its teeth were sharp and strong. Chewing that squirrel head up only took the dog a few seconds. After that, it swallowed the squirrel head and licked its teeth. Then, it lowered its head to eat the squirrel’s body.</p> <p>The cute red squirrel which had watery eyes and big fluffy tail became a meal for the zombie dog just like that.</p> <p>As the dog was enjoying its food, Lin Qiao glanced back at the woods behind and found that quite a lot rodents were living there. She guessed that those animals were all living on those mutated sweet potato plants in this area.</p> <p>She had erased the parts of those sweet potato plants which were exposed in the air with her black mist. That was as easy as wiping out foam. However, the sweet potatoes in the soil hadn’t been cleaned out. Those needed to be dug out, or some earth-powered people might be able to turn up the soil to dig out those sweet potatoes and throw them away.</p> <p>Those were mutated, not edible anyway.</p> <p>Maybe because this sweet potato field was thriving, the rodents in this area were living a good life. Most of them were as huge as that dead squirrel.</p> <p>Also, Lin Qiao felt that the rodents here were a little… overpopulated.</p> <p>The zombie dog should eat more of them.</p> <p>After those sweet potato plants were cleaned out, the soil was exposed, and so were some holes on the ground. The larger holes were as wide as a human head. Lin Qiao believed that under those holes were the tunnels created by rodents.</p> <p>That was why she figured that the zombie dog should go and catch more of those rodents.</p> <p>“Bowwow, go and catch more when you are finished,” Lin Qiao lowered her head to talk to the zombie dog. She was too lazy to come up with a serious name for the dog, so she just called it Bowwow.</p> <p>The dog didn’t respond to her, but kept eating the squirrel.</p> <p><em>‘Eh? It actually ignored me!’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao felt a little annoyed, so she raised a hand and released a wisp of black mist that quickly drifted toward the dead squirrel which was in the zombie dog’s mouth.</p> <p>While eating, the zombie dog suddenly saw a wisp of black mist coming at it.</p> <p>“Owooo…” It sprung up with fright and hurriedly drew back, even leaving the half-eaten squirrel on the ground.</p> <p>After that, it raised its head to look at Lin Qiao with discontentment, then turned to the black mist with fear.</p> <p>“Bowwow, I called your name, but you wouldn’t answer! That’s what you’ll get when you don’t answer me. Next time, respond to me! Do you understand?” Lin Qiao pointed at the dog and said.</p> <p>The zombie dog had no idea what Bowwow meant.</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted and kept pointing at the dog as she continued, “From now on, your name is Bowwow. Do you understand?”</p> <p>“Er?” the zombie dog was bewildered.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pointed at the remains of the squirrel, then at the woods behind her, and said, “Finish this quickly, and then catch more. I want you to catch all rats and squirrels in that hill. Do you understand me?”</p> <p>“Ow?” The zombie dog looked at Lin Qiao. <em>‘Why do I need to catch them all?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao responded, “Cut the crap! Just eat it. Don’t leave it here. It looks so disgusting!”</p>",
  "Chapter 422: A Strange Way Of Thinking": "<p>The zombie dog glanced at her, then at that motionless wisp of black mist, finally uttering very unhappy roars.</p> <p>“Owooooowooo…” <em>‘I was enjoying the food! Why did you release this terrifying black smoke to scare me? Now I’ve lost my appetite, but you want me to finish it?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao took the black mist back and laughed to the dog, “That’s because you ignored me just now. I called your name but you wouldn’t answer.”</p> <p>“Owooo!” <em>‘How am I supposed to know whom you were calling?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao glared at the dog and said, “Are you going to eat it or not? You have to finish it, or I’ll kill you.”</p> <p>“Ow…” The dog felt so benign when Lin Qiao threatened it. After giving a few sullen howls, it lowered its head and quickly finished the remains of the dead squirrel, even swallowing its fur.</p> <p>Then, it turned and darted back into the woods. And next, a series of noises were heard from the woods again.</p> <p>Lin Qiao watched the dog run into the woods, then leaped off the stone and walked toward those mutated sweet potato plants which hadn’t been cleared yet. Those sweet potato plants were surrounding those sweetcorn plants.</p> <p>She squatted to observe those healthy sweet potato plants around the sweetcorn plants. There were holes under those healthy sweet potato plants too.</p> <p>Compared with mutated sweet potatoes, those fat rodents here preferred healthy sweet potatoes.</p> <p>At that moment, a white figure descended from the sky and landed on the roof of the car which was beside Xie Dong and Shen Yujen.</p> <p>“What is she doing?” Qiu Lili looked at Lin Qiao and asked curiously. Xie Dong and Shen Yujen turned and shook their heads at her.</p> <p>Qiu Lili glanced at the ground under Lin Qiao’s feet and hesitated for a second because of the soil, then gave up on the idea of flying over to Lin Qiao.</p> <p>When Lin Qiao came back onto the highway, she asked, “What are you doing here?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked to the car, then pointed at the field which was now much emptier than before, “We can turn the soil up and grow things here. However, this place has lots of rats… giant rats. I’ve sent the dog to catch them.”</p> <p>“Dog? Where is a dog?” Qiu Lili asked with surprise.</p> <p>Lin Qiao pointed at the zombie dog which was just running out of the woods and responded, “Over there. Isn’t that a dog?”</p> <p>The zombie dog stopped near the rock on which Lin Qiao stood earlier, looking at Qiu Lili with fear. It didn’t dare to get close to the car.</p> <p>Held in its mouth was a rat which was even larger than a cat, with a long and thick tail. This time, the dog had caught a rat instead of a squirrel, a giant, wild rat.</p> <p>“Wow, where did you find this super ugly dog!” Qiu Lili burst in screams at the sight of the dog, her voice filled with dislike.</p> <p>“I found it on my way back to Sea City Base the last time,” said Lin Qiao.</p> <p>After that, she pointed at the field and said, “We can grow things in this piece of land. But before that, we need to turn the soil up and catch all the rats.”</p> <p>While observing the zombie dog, Qiu Lili decided not to get near to that thing. Meanwhile, she asked, “So, you found that to catch rats?”</p> <p>She strongly disliked the dog, but didn’t try to persuade Lin Qiao not to keep it, or even suggest her to throw it away.</p> <p>Lin Qiao shook her head and said, “No. I didn’t know that this place was filled with rats back then. I kept it because it looks cool.”</p> <p>“Aren’t you afraid that it might eat people? What if it rushed into the base to eat the people there?” asked Qiu Lili.</p> <p>“I surely will keep an eye on it,” said Lin Qiao, “I won’t let it leave my sight. Normally, I’ll keep it in my space, and only let it out in wild places.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili nodded knowingly, then asked with curiosity, “Why didn’t you kill that mutated large snake over there? I thought you’d kill it.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao was puzzled for a second before figuring out that Qiu Lili had gone to see that snake.</p> <p>“You didn’t kill it, did you?” she asked Qiu Lili.</p> <p>Qiu Lili shook her head and said, “No. I’m just curious. You were going to kill it, but why did you suddenly give up?”</p> <p>Hearing that, Lin Qiao replied, “Well, I felt it was… a little special. It seemed to be very smart. It was going to be killed, but it didn’t go crazy. Snakes with such kind of temperament are rarely seen. Normally, a large snake like that could be quite dangerous when going crazy.”</p> <p>“It didn’t go crazy?” Qiu Lili asked confusedly, “Is that the reason why you didn’t kill it? Why?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao explained to her, “Didn’t I tell you? It’s special. I felt that it’s like a kind-hearted girl.”</p> <p>Hearing that, Qiu Lili, Xie Dong, and Shen Yujen all dropped their faces in bewilderment.</p> <p><em>‘What the hell! Who would compare an unmerciful cold-blood animal to a kind-hearted girl? Isn’t your way of thinking too weird? Were you like this before you became a zombie?’</em></p> <p>The three of them suddenly felt that the world in Lin Qiao’s eyes was too strange to be understood. Qiu Lili couldn’t help but roll her eyes, “So, that snake was so innocent. It was staying peacefully at home, but you forced it out and beat it up. It was nearly killed!”</p> <p>Lin Qiao spread her hands and said, “Exactly! This post-apocalyptic world follows the law of the jungle. It encountered someone stronger, so it couldn’t even run. It wasn’t the hunter’s fault. And I’ve spared its life. I’m a kind person.”</p> <p>“Are you kind?” said Qiu Lili, “Well, you’re not a bad person, but you’re not kind. Being kind means being silly! Kindness just sounds better than silliness.”</p> <p>Lin Qiao leaned against the door and crossed her arms before her chest as she smilingly raised her head to look at Qiu Lili and said, “Aren’t you kind too?”</p> <p>Qiu Lili was puzzled for a second, then understood her meaning. “Are you saying that I’m silly?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao spread her hands and laughed, “I didn’t say that.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili snorted, then pouted and turned around, deciding not to talk to Lin Qiao anymore. However, in just two seconds, she turned back and said, “How long are you going to stay in this place? Do you plan to go anywhere else?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao glanced at the zombie dog which was standing by the stone, then said, “I need to wait until it has caught all the rats in that woods.”</p> <p>Qiu Lili looked at the zombie dog with confusion and asked, “When will that be? Aren’t we going back?”</p> <p>Lin Qiao said, “Maybe you can go back with these two? Or, you can go anywhere you want. I need to stay here. We need to turn up the soil, but we’re shorthanded now. I’m thinking that… Should we catch a few level-three or four zombies and train them into farmers?”</p> <p>While speaking, she glanced at Xie Dong and Shen Yujen.</p> <p>Xie Dong and Shen Yujen were willing to turn up the soil. However, they didn’t quite understand what Lin Qiao meant by ‘catch a few level-three or four zombies and train them into farmers. She said catch… and train…</p> <p>Well, people were underpopulated, so she decided to exploit the workforce from zombies. There were plenty of zombies in this post-apocalyptic world anyway.</p>",
  "Chapter 423: Hunt Level-Four Zombies": "<p>With that idea, Lin Qiao jumped into action. She quickly put Bowwow back into her space and started hunting zombies. Also, she needed to find some tools like hoes and shovels.</p> <p>Almost all level-four and three zombies had been driven away, so Lin Qiao needed to go to farther areas to find some of them.</p> <p>Of all, only she could do something like turning zombies into coolies.</p> <p>She left Mount Wu scenic area and climbed onto the tallest building nearby, then stood on the roof and closed her eyes to sense the surrounding area. As she reopened her eyes, she flashed across the air and turned invisible, heading toward the nearest level-four zombie.</p> <p>Her invisible body had no shadows under the sunlight. She leaped across the tops of utility poles to approach that zombie. The buildings in this area were sparsely arranged, separated by lots of green belts. So, Lin Qiao found stepping on utility poles more convenient.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later, she arrived at an abandoned factory area.</p> <p>The area wasn’t large, including a three-story factory building and a five-story dormitory building. The gate was before the factory building, and the two buildings were connected, surrounded by a couple of houses.</p> <p>Those buildings were waste and dilapidated.</p> <p>The iron gate was half-open. Some curtains were fluttering noisily in the wind outside the windows, looking very creepy in this desolate area. However, that was also the most often seen scene in the post-apocalyptic era.</p> <p>Seeing a clean and tiny building out here would be a really strange thing.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked into the half-open gate and saw a figure swiftly flash through the third floor of the factory building.</p> <p>A figure suddenly appearing in such an uninhabited could be quite a scary thing!</p> <p>However, that figure was actually Lin Qiao’s target.</p> <p>Almost all zombies in the Upper City District were under the control of zombie number one to seven. The zombies in the district had been driven out, and the ones outside had been driven inward. All those zombies were gathered together into a large circle to surround Victoria Hotel.</p> <p>Miles around the hotel, all roads and paths and been blocked.</p> <p>Meanwhile, zombie number one to seven had been keeping eyes on the areas with relatively fewer zombies; that was the mission that Lin Qiao gave them. However, it would be not easy for them to control the zombie crowd if too many level three and four zombies were in it.</p> <p>Taking the middle-aged male zombie as an example, he was only controlling two level-three zombies, but wasn’t able to control any level-four zombies. He was powerful enough to suppress the level-four zombies, but it was impossible for him to control them.</p> <p>Therefore, Lin Qiao ordered zombie number one to seven to drive away all the level-four zombies and most of the level-three ones.</p> <p>At this moment, she walked to the stairs of the factory building, then silently went up. The zombie upstairs didn’t yet know that she was coming, so it was still wandering up there.</p> <p>Lin Qiao came up and stood by the stairs, observing this level-four zombie.</p> <p>It was a female zombie. Judging by her clothing and her unwounded face, she was a middle-aged woman. She was wearing a white suit which had been worn for five years, and hence already turned brown.</p> <p>Her jacket was broken, even missing a sleeve. Underneath the jacket was a dress, and its edge was broken as well.</p> <p>Her feet were bared and very dirty.</p> <p>Her hair used to be worn in a bun, as a hairpin was still hanging loosely behind her head. Her messy hair were spread on both sides of her face.</p> <p>Based on the dark blood stains on her mouth and claws, Lin Qiao figured that she had eaten quite some flesh.</p> <p>The female zombie stopped walking as she sensed that someone was staring at her. She stood on the hallway and looked around warily, but found nothing suspicious. As a result, she was a little confused.</p> <p>Slowly, she walked to a window and looked outside. Meanwhile, Lin Qiao slowly approached her, then looked around.</p> <p>The furnishings on this floor weren’t in a mess, and were only covered in a thick layer of dust. The objects on the tables remained where they were supposed to be, and all the tables were pretty tidy.</p> <p>All the chairs were under the tables, and there was no garbage on the floor.</p> <p>It seemed that not too many people were here when the apocalypse happened. Lin Qiao guessed that most of the people who worked in this factory were in the dormitory building when it happened. Perhaps, she would see lots of dried blood on the floors, stairs, and walls in the dormitory building if she went over there now.</p> <p>She quietly walked toward the female zombie. Her invisible feet had actually left a series of faint footprints on the dusty floor. However, that female zombie didn’t notice those.</p> <p>Lin Qiao walked up to her and sniffed at her.</p> <p>Ugh… she smelled awful!</p> <p>Almost every zombie had that awful smell, but that female zombie smelled especially awful. That stink of rotten flesh was coming from her mouth.</p> <p>If she opened her mouth, that smell might even knock out a person standing two meters away.</p> <p>What made Lin Qiao feel strange was that no hostility was detected from that female zombie, and there was only a weird kind of ferocity.</p> <p>Where did she get that vibe? In fact, at level-four and above, the vibe of every zombie was unique, because their vibes would vary according to their different living styles.</p> <p>The two level-four zombies who used to be under Qiu Lili’s command were ugly, but not hostile, because they never killed any human beings, and rarely fought other zombies.</p> <p>This female zombie who was standing before Lin Qiao’s eyes had a fierce vibe, meaning that she was a powerful one. However, she didn’t have that hostility that all the zombies which often ate human beings should have. How did that happen?</p> <p>Was that because she hadn’t eaten any living human beings for a long time?</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood behind her with confusion as she crossed her arms, then began scratching her pretty chin.</p> <p>Those blood stains on that female zombie’s mouth and fingers should be left from the blood and flesh that she had eaten.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent a while observing her, then suddenly reached out a hand and grabbed the neck of the female zombie who was looking outside the window. In the next second, she flashed back into her space.</p> <p>“Roar!” The female zombie was frightened by Lin Qiao’s sudden move. She immediately raised her hand to sweep away her arm, then hunched her back and quickly jumped to a relatively safer place.</p> <p>She roared at Lin Qiao fiercely; her twisted face wore obvious anger and fear.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked at her and nodded; she was fierce indeed.</p> <p>“Stop roaring! No matter how loud you are, you can never defeat me. I think you know that. Perhaps, you can’t even win against him,” said Lin Qiao to her calmly. Finishing talking, she pointed at the zombie dog which had quietly walked up behind the female zombies.</p> <p>The female zombie turned back to find that a level-five zombie dog was at less than two-meters from her.</p> <p>Once the zombie dog pounced on her, she would be torn into two pieces. That short distance between the dog and her meant she would have no chance to run.</p> <p>“Roar!” The female zombie’s vibe was instantly suppressed. She looked at the zombie dog with fright, and couldn’t help but draw back in another direction.</p>",
  "Chapter 424: Suppressed By The Space": "<p>The female zombie soon realized that this place was giving her a strange feeling, as if all her power had been suppressed.</p> <p>Lin Qiao slightly narrowed her eyes and said to her, “Yes, your power has been suppressed, because this place is my space. In here, you’ll die if I want you to. Do you understand?”</p> <p>The female zombie turned to look at her with fright, eyes containing disbelief. Fear, panic, sadness, anger… all sorts of complicated feelings were showing on her face.</p> <p>She had been really unlucky recently. She was living a good life in her own territory, but a level-five strange zombie suddenly showed up and drove her away. That zombie didn’t kill it, but only forced her away from her territory.</p> <p>She admitted defeat and left her home, as she wasn’t able to win against that zombie. Later on, she learned that many of her old neighbors had been driven away from home as well, which made her feel slightly better.</p> <p>Her territory was occupied by a group of humans, and those humans were guarded by a group of level-five zombies. She assumed that those human beings were kept as food by those level-five zombies, or that zombie queen.</p> <p>She saw Lin Feng and the others as the stored food of the group of zombie leaders or Qiu Lili, who had restrained her vibe as much as she could.</p> <p>Not long after she lost her territory, she was targeted by another zombie queen. And now, that zombie queen had brought her into a strange place and suppressed her power.</p> <p>The female zombie waved her claws, feeling that her strength had turned weak.</p> <p>Lin Qiao had recently found out that she was now able to control the air pressure in her space. She finally understood why the space was able to limit the powers of superpowered human beings. It was because the energy contained in the air in this place was under the full control of her and Viney.</p> <p>Before, Viney was controlling the energy, so Lin Qiao didn’t have a strong feeling about it. But now, as Viney had left this space and come into her belly, she felt different.</p> <p>She clearly felt how she was able to control this space.</p> <p>With merely one thought, she would be able to control the energy contained in the air to suppress the energy which was produced by the zombie virus, or the superpowers generated from mutation.</p> <p>So, she only needed a thought to suppress a zombie who was filled with the zombie virus.</p> <p>She looked at the frightened female zombie and said, “You have to follow my orders, unless you want to die. If you do not obey, you will have to die. You’ll all die in the future, because you are not supposed to exist in this world. You’ll all be erased gradually.”</p> <p>“Roar…” <em>‘I don’t know what you’re talking about… Who are you?’</em></p> <p>The female zombie didn’t understand her meaning. However, she managed to calm down a little, as Lin Qiao was standing at a safe distance away and showing no sign of attacking her.</p> <p>Lin Qiao waved at the zombie dog. Following her move, the dog stopped staring at the female zombie and walked toward Lin Qiao.</p> <p>“From now on, I am the leader of this place, and the strongest one who controls you all. I am not only able to control you, but I can also provide you with a stable life, under one condition—You all must follow my order, or I’ll kill you!” As the zombie dog walked to her, Lin Qiao said to the female zombie. After that, she fully released her vibe and sent waves of killing intention toward the female zombie.</p> <p>“Roar!” The female zombie’s legs trembled. She was terrified, so she bent her knees and directly knelt to the ground. Under the suppression given by Lin Qiao’s vibe, her brain wasn’t working at all.</p> <p>Seeing that, Lin Qiao hurriedly restrained her vibe. She almost forgot that her vibe could be strengthened by many times over in her space. She was worried that the female zombie might be stupefied.</p> <p>“Owooo…” Even the zombie dog lied on the ground, looking at her with fear.</p> <p>Lin Qiao looked around, then raised a hand and waved at the woods. Along with her move, a metal object flew out.</p> <p>Clang! A stainless steel bowl landed in Lin Qiao’s hand. That was the bowl which the zombie dog drank from.</p> <p>She walked to the lakeside and filled the bowl with water, then came back to the zombie dog. Then, she squatted and put the bowl before the dog.</p> <p>“Don’t bark! I won’t abuse you as long as you do what I say,” she put down the bowl and said. Afterward, she stood up and waved a hand again. This time, a glass appeared in her hand.</p> <p>She went to the lakeside once again to fetch a glassful of water, then returned to the female zombie.</p> <p>At that moment, the female zombie’s entire body radiated fear and despair.</p> <p>“Get up, drink this,” Lin Qiao stood by her side and said.</p> <p>The female zombie only trembled without making any other reactions, remaining curling on the ground.</p> <p>Lin Qiao squatted impatiently and reached out her empty hand to raise the female zombie’s head, then put the glass near her mouth.</p> <p>“Drink it! Don’t make me say it for the third time,” she threatened her coldly.</p> <p>Hearing that, the female zombie gingerly looked at her as she raised her upper body but stayed kneeling.</p> <p>Lin Qiao took back her hand, then frowned and continued, “Stand up and hold the glass.” After saying that, she put the glasses further near the female zombie.</p> <p>The female zombie took over the glass with both hands in terror, then carefully gave Lin Qiao a glance. Her purely dark eyes were filled with fear. Clearly, she was scared out of her wits by Lin Qiao just now.</p> <p>While looking at Lin Qiao, she slowly stood up. At the same time, the latter stood up as well and made two steps backward.</p> <p>The female zombie put the glass near her mouth, then sensed an attractive kind of energy from the water. She was puzzled for a second, then looked at the water with confusion.</p> <p>The atmosphere had been too tense, so she hadn’t noticed that energy until now.</p> <p>Once she noticed it, she couldn’t help but be attracted to it.</p> <p><em>‘What is this? It seems to be tasty. The energy smells good as well.’</em></p> <p>She raised her head to look at Lin Qiao. The latter gave her the water, meaning that she could drink it.</p> <p>Lin Qiao crossed her arms before her chest, then took two steps further backward to give the female zombie enough space. She did that so the female zombie could feel safe and be less nervous.</p> <p>As she stepped back, the female zombie was finally a little relieved. She took a small sip of the water, and then her face showed a trace of joy. After that, she emptied the glass in one breath, and then took a bite of the glass.</p> <p>“Don’t… eat the glass…” said Lin Qiao. Looking at the cracked glass, she felt very helpless.</p> <p>Why did zombies like to chew glasses and cups? That was a glass! Wasn’t she afraid that her teeth might be broken?</p> <p>The female zombie looked at her confusedly.</p> <p>“Eat the whole glass if you can!” said Lin Qiao angrily.</p> <p>Once she said that, the female zombie put the whole glass into her mouth and began chewing.</p> <p>Seeing the blood streaming down her mouth, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but feel disgusted.</p> <p>“Alright, alright! Stop eating it! Does it even taste good?” She hurriedly waved her hand in exasperation.</p>",
  "Chapter 425: Make Zombies Dig Holes": "<p>After taming the female zombie, Lin Qiao put her in small space number one and forbade her from coming out. After that, she exited her space to find more zombies.</p> <p>The city used to have a lot of level-four and five zombies. However, almost all level-five zombies had been scared away by Qiu Lili, and had left the downtown area.</p> <p>Lin Qiao spent three days searching across the city and found a dozen level-four zombies, with all sorts of powers.</p> <p>One of them even had the rare spirit power.</p> <p>That was a boy who looked like a high-school student, about five-feet and seven-inches tall. His clothes were the cleanest among all, because he was smarter than the others, and seemed like a neat freak.</p> <p>He didn’t have wounds on his face. His eyes were cold and dark, and his face was clean and pale. The dark circles under his eyes were huge. His hair seemed to be often washed by water. They weren’t as clean as the hair of many healthy human beings, but were still way better than the hair of the other zombies.</p> <p>He would look great without those dark circles under his eyes.</p> <p>This spirit-powered zombie wasn’t as panicked as the other zombies when he was caught by Lin Qiao. On the contrary, he calmly negotiated with Lin Qiao.</p> <p>Lin Qiao found him in a school. After being suddenly dragged into Lin Qiao’s space, he spent a few seconds quietly staring at her in the eyes, then began looking around with composure.</p> <p>Soon, he noticed the special lake.</p> <p>He didn’t dare to rush directly at the lake, as his power was limited in this place, and that gave him a great sense of crisis.</p> <p>Also, he didn’t yet know why Lin Qiao brought him in.</p> <p>“Do you want to drink some of that water? Follow my orders, and I’ll give some to you,” Lin Qiao said to him.</p> <p>“Roar…” He asked Lin Qiao cautiously, as he worried that she might be lying.<em>‘Really?’</em></p> <p>Lin Qiao pointed at the three small spaces and the woods area, then said, “Work for me like them, and I’ll let you drink the water from here every day. However, you are not allowed to go near the lake without my permission. If you violate my rules, don’t blame me for having no mercy.”</p> <p>Some of those level-four zombies that Lin Qiao caught these days didn’t want to follow her rules. They couldn’t resist the temptation from the lake water, so when Lin Qiao wasn’t here, they attempted to go directly into the lake.</p> <p>However, Lin Qiao sensed their movements once they made them. As a result, she flashed in and crumbled their heads.</p> <p>Such things happened two or three times. The other zombies decided to stick strictly to the rules after watching Lin Qiao savagely kill those greedy zombies.</p> <p>Also for that reason, Lin Qiao warned every level-four zombie that she brought in later on.</p> <p>“Roar!” The boy agreed without hesitation. <em>‘Deal, as long as you let me drink the water.’</em></p> <p>As a possessor of spirit power, his physical strength was weaker than that of the other zombies; also, he was slower than the others. Back in the outside, he often needed to hide from the other same-level zombies. No to mention attacking other zombies for their nuclei, it was already difficult for him to keep his own nucleus safe.</p> <p>Once he was brought into this space, he had sensed that the energy contained in the lake could help him upgrade. Not only did the lake contain the energy, but so did the air. Being exposed in the air here for a long time would also make a difference.</p> <p>If he occupied this space for his own, he would be able to stay here forever to absorb the energy here…</p> <p>Lin Qiao quietly stared at him and said abruptly, “If you want to stay here, you should get rid of that idea which you aren’t supposed to have. What power do you think you have that can make this place your own?”</p> <p>Her words destroyed the zombie’s fantasy.</p> <p>She didn’t only say those words to warn that zombie boy, but also to let the other zombies know that she was able to read their minds.</p> <p>“Yes, I can read your mind, every one of you. When you had that idea just now, I wanted to kill you,” said Lin Qiao while sending her strong vibe toward that zombie boy.</p> <p>Right now, that zombie boy felt a true terror. He realized that the zombie standing in front of him was not only at a much higher level than he was, but was also way smarter than him.</p> <p>That made him feel as if he was a clown.</p> <p>He didn’t know what a clown was, but he felt like one.</p> <p>“Owooo…” The zombie dog didn’t like that zombie boy who had an extra weak vibe. As Lin Qiao spent a long time talking to him, the dog walked to her with jealousy.</p> <p>“Why are you howling? Go and stay over there,” Lin Qiao glanced at the dog and said.</p> <p>After catching almost all level-four zombies in the Upper City District and killing some of them, Lin Qiao brought the rest of them back to the sweet potato field and let them out.</p> <p>About a dozen level-four zombies suddenly showed up on the field, looking around confusedly.</p> <p>Lin Qiao tied a rope on a hand of each of them to limit their range of activity.</p> <p>Those ropes weren’t strong. However, she had told those zombies that anyone who broke the rope and ran would be suffering real pain. She had deals with them. If they regretted and took off, she would kill them.</p> <p>The Upper City District was her territory now, and no one was allowed to act unruly in this area.</p> <p>Those zombies needed her permission to do free activities.</p> <p>Those zombies were all very afraid of her, and all wanted to run. However, as they saw the large circle above their heads which was formed from the dark mist that Lin Qiao had released, they were aware that they would have no chance to run.</p> <p>The sense of crisis which was given by the dark mist was stronger than that from Lin Qiao herself by many times over.</p> <p>Lin Qiao stood in front of those zombies, then squatted and began digging a rat hole with her claws.</p> <p>“Watch me do it first, and do whatever I do.”</p> <p>Those zombies all understood her words, so she didn’t need to spend the extra mental energy to control their minds.</p> <p>Zombies had sharp teeth and claws. So for them, digging with claws would be more efficient than with tools.</p> <p>Those zombies had no idea what she was digging. They watched her with curiosity, until she dug out a few large sweet potatoes.</p> <p>She threw away those sweet potatoes which each weighed a couple of kilograms, then said, “Here, you need to dig these out. The more you dig out, the more water you’ll get.”</p> <p>Those zombies looked at her confusedly. They still didn’t understand why she wanted them to dig sweet potatoes. Were those edible?</p> <p>However, despite how confused they were, none of them dared to be disobedient as they quickly squatted and started digging. Some of them even tasted those sweet potatoes with curiosity, and as a result, their faces were filled with dislike after the very first bites.</p> <p>Lin Qiao sat by the edge of the woods and said to the zombie dog which wanted very much to go in there, “Bowwow, get in and get me a large rat. Don’t bite through its skin though, because I don’t want to eat your saliva.”</p> <p>She ordered the zombie dog to catch her a rat to eat.</p> <p>Nearby, Xie Dong and Shen Yujen, who had spent the past three days digging sweet potatoes with hoes, were stunned upon seeing Lin Qiao show up with over ten level-four zombies. After that, they saw her squat to teach those zombies to dig holes!</p> <p>The expressions on their faces were just indescribable…</p>"
